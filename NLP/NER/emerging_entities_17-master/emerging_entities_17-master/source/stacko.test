@Alex , you can use whatever basis you'd like . Whether it is an eigenbasis of $\hat X$ , $\hat P$ or $\hat H$ . And of course you can always express the elements of one basis in terms of another basis , e.g. $\langle p | \psi \rangle$ which is the fourier transform of the wave function $\langle x | \psi \rangle$ .

Since , the payments system is primary intended for micro-transactions , the trade-off is maybe acceptable . But i personally believe biometrics should n't not be handled by untrusted third parties .

You cannot use other covariant things for constant tensor $C^{\mu\nu}$ for example Kronecker delta has different indices structure i.e. $\delta^\mu{}_\nu$ so you need to write $C^{\mu\nu}=B \eta^{\mu\nu}$ when $B$ is a constant scalar .
I think we talk about matter distribution when we talk about the size of the universe and energy apart from space-time energy . We know about the expansion of that matter and energy , but the space probably has existed outside of our " universe ". It 's just that space is being created between the matter that is increasing the size of the universe .

Well assuming it 's correct here 's a hint maybe . You can consider $\Sigma$ to be $\delta(x')\delta(y')$ and plug in the potential of a point charge into your formula to derive an integral expression for the delta function . Then you can write an arbitrary potential as an integral over point sources , and 'll see your formula is valid as long as it is valid for the delta function . But I was skeptical the formula is valid for the delta function since the integrand seems to be strictly positive .

But do those prophecies really testify a crime 's culprit ? Say for example , there 's a prophecy there where Voldemort killed Dumbledore . For instance , there 's a report Dumbledore was murdered by an anonymous character and they frame it to Voldemort because he was the one inside the prophecy , but he did n't kill him . And like what Dumbledore said , sometimes prophecies can be fulfilled , can be not , can be fulfilled when the one inside it puts an attention with it .

Free electrons theory not always works for metals . It fails for example for ferromagnetic systems . As far as I know , the way one can avoid Coulomb repulsion in using the Landau-Fermi liquid theory . I do n't really know much about this model but as I understand this theory maps the interacting electrons into non-interacting quasi particles . In this sense , the Coulomb repulsion is hidden by some sort of " change of variables ".

A WAF is usually the wrong level to try prevent web shell infection - if you can upload executable files to a server , there will be ways to bypass a WAF through encoding , or splitting data , or using a multi stage payload . It might be difficult , but there are lots of ways to hide data . You 're better off preventing the upload of executable files on the server - put uploads in a folder which does n't allow execution , rename them , etc .
Using full disk encryption would work - does n't prevent ransomware ( but that 's not a concern in the original question) , but even if the hard drive is removed , an attacker would n't be able to access the data . A container is less good , since it 's possible traces of the files could be written in clear form to the drive , whilst they 're being used - that applies to both encrypted zip and veracrypt container .

Your are basically asking in a major part of this too broad question if you can trust somebody 100% . Unless you believe in fairy tales you should see that each person and institution has their own interest first and that you cannot trust anybody 100% to work in exactly your interest . Maybe you can get 99% trust , maybe even 99.9 % trust but never 100% . This is not restricted to computer security but this is just real life .

One item that is missing from this answer - almost all crimes are prosecuted at the state level , including murder . Sometimes there are crimes that fall into federal jurisdiction , or both . Presidential pardon power pertains to forgiving crimes as recognized under federal statute , so promising to pardon someone for murdering a litterbug would not stop state and local criminal justice processes from moving forward and punishing an offender .
To start thinking about this you need to think about why there is resistance in the first place . What prevents a charge carrier to accelerate without bound when subject to an electric field .

Statistical mechanics aims at doing much more than merely deriving the equations of states of thermodynamic systems .

In part , shooting darker is itself probably a pushback against the even , flat lighting that 's also common , esp . on tv . So it 's pushback on pushback on pushback as with so many things . But another trend is also more frenetic action scenes with freely moving cameras ( the _Bourne_ movies did this , Michael Bay made it worse) ; that probably also carries some of the blame for actions scenes being harder to follow , not just the lighting .

Also I think Sauron , in his arrogance , never thought that anyone would want to destroy the ring , he thought all would be twisted and wish to dominate as he did .

And for any future similar schemes , remember The Golden Rule of Password Management , derived from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs's_principle : A good password is one that you should be able to explain *exactly* how it was generated *without any loss of security* . If you might be even *faintly* reluctant to explain every step of the process *in detail* , you 're doing it wrong . For obvious reasons , this scheme does not pass that test .

Best current methods for preventing data leakage from SSD
The question was who this person was , and there 's a whole lot more to who a person is than their name . Also , the answer seemed to totally ignore the " and why is he important " half of the question . I thought that the extra info might help fill that in . If you disagree , I suppose I could take it to its own answer ...
@Omegacron : It looks like you should answer [ this]( http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/150472/does-logan-wolverine-get-drunk )

Thanks @Anders . Following your clue and given OWASP page i was able to test my application against session fixation and found it positive . Now looking for remote testing . Trying to grab the cookie remotely using javascript script . Have any idea how to test it ?
@David it depends what you want to do ... $\Phi'$ can be endowed with many topologies ( ultraweak , weak , etc . ) . The point is whether you need or not the topological properties of the dual . Usually on distributions one does not look at topological aspects .
Sorry , for clarification - the final " password " should be of length of random generated string - e.g. 20 chars .

They were about electrons reflecting light and I had this question in mind so I asked it .
But how could I use 3rd party cookies for authentication on another server ? I do n't understand the idea . Could you tell more ? I guess there would be a way to to log in without passwords . I can make an api on these sites that would programmaticaly log them in , I only need to figure out how to create , store and use authentication tokens for the api .
@DavidGrinberg - That is also the domain of the answerer . To answer this , you would basically have to know about a political theorist which constructed citizenship in such a way as to explicitly allow for things like that to happen . I do n't know of any , so I ca n't offer you a tip on what the result might look like .
@Tim - I 'm not sure I can accept that answer , but I if properly baked up from the quotes I am pretty sure it'd be an upvotable one .
I suggest you compare the scheme with SSH password-less login . . http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/9870/are-passwordless-ssh-logins-more-secure

Is the Millennium Falcon seen in Attack of the Clones ?
Remove zlib compression , maybe . There are attacks that use compression , I do n't know if they 're applicable in sftp context . Otherwise I do n't see a problem , it 's not like this is ssh you use to administer the server - if you ca n't connect you 're not locked out and can relax the settings . If the server supports elliptic curve crypto , ecdh and ed25519 keys are better than your config .
@Gert Yes , it is launched in a gravitational field . I am assuming the if there is no gravity then the initial and final velocity of the projectile would be same .

Heisenberg uncertainty principle , what is it ?
@TankorSmash I think you just did it for me , in a way . However , the film translates " baba yaga " to " the boogeyman " ( or , rather , it says that Wick is the " the guy you send to _kill the boogeyman_ " ) , which is very different from the Russian myth of a supernatural forest-dwelling woman ... The movie 's point , however , is just to say that Wick is practically more myth than man . The details of the myth they refer to are n't too important .
Thanks , @Valorum , for fixing the quote :) I just could n't get it pieced together fully from the little snippets I could find .
Is this a laptop in the Weasley 's house ?
Seeing the 1/R relationship definitely cleared it up for me . I did n't know that gravity worked in that way . I figured it is stronger near the center of a spherical object but it does n't increase because the matter does n't increase . However , if the radius is reduced ( it becomes more dense) , gravity increases until a limit is reached ( eg PEP) . Thanks !

Yeah this is just a theory I have as I really really really wish that Matt would return < 3

Although I use Wikipedia I ca n't agree with the definition of an EM **field** . What we can observe are electric fields , magnetic fields and EM radiation . Any force field reacts on another field of the same kind and this second field react in the same way on the first field , actio = reactio . eM radiation can act with its light pressure on other bodies or in detail photons can excite electrons , but this is not the interaction of a field .

@DavidGrinberg The 3/5 compromise had nothing to do with the status of the slaves . It only had to do with the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives . The North ( free states ) wanted slaves to not count because they were not considered citizens in the slave states and the South ( slave holding states ) wanted them to count fully ( to increase thir political power) .

I do n't think its possible to give you a quantitative measure of how much forward security multiple hash functions would buy . Basically , using multiple hash functions guards against a weakness in any one of them , so as long as just one survives through the decades , you 're safe .

IIRC , the movie director submits a list of award categories he thinks his film should be considered for to the academy . The academy then decides which of those categories the film should be properly nominated for ( No , they do n't watch *every movie* made in a given year in order to pick nominations . ) My guess would be that the director submitted a blanket list of every category he could think of , and the fact that both of these got through was an oversight .
