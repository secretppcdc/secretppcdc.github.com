The 3 best songs of FOB:     1:All 2:Of 3:Them
The goosebumps from this song reminds me of 2nd Law: Unsustainable by Muse. Same dubstep-kinda drops, etc.
I literally just got an ad about this before this video... okay
This song is pretty awesome but I feel bad because its not typical f.o.b music
this is too much...
HAM AND LETTUCE XD
bitch this song sucks and she was RAISED by FURRIES??? this shit is horrible btw lmao
Please. Don't. Make. This. Your. New. Style. ;-;
Does anyone saw Clint Eastwood?...
What is this garbage...
love this video
First I hated it, now i'm obsessed
I bet any of u, that brendon urie is in one of those llama costumes .-.
sounds like shit..... trash
Just got tickets to the Boston show of the tour and I'm so damned excited 😁
0:51 "saying boobs"
by the fourth listen i loved it.
3:37 When them drugs hit.
Omg i love this Song! Fall out boy you are the greatest!
Are the llamas in this video only here to taunt Daniel and his new branding?lol
I love this song so much!!!!
Sell Out Boy
why isn't this song more popular
sounds really good you guy's!!
"Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind" Congratulations,Patrick.You did it.
F U R R I E S
This isn't that bad tbh
I've seen where the wild things are. this is fine.
i much preferred your older songs so plz can you sing like you used to again
irresistible 2.0 ?
I've replayed this way to many times
clearly the people that liked this video weren't into EDM in the early 2000's.
I didn't listen to FOB when Pete was an Emo Vampire but hell I miss my other Emo Vampire. but the new stuff is still really good :)
great song, I'll be sure to download it of a dodgy site cause I can't afford to buy it but I would if I could.
daniel got rid of his llama branding so fob took it.
Okay I love Fall Out Boy but the chorus just sounds like every other popular song. Love the versus though.
i love this song so much ffs
I think the kid is just sees his parents as llamas. But he wanted them to be like any other family in a behavior way. Not appearance
what happened to them, it sounds awful
I mean, I fuck with it
I love this omg I'll forever be a fan
wtf that mv means?
it sounds like Patrick is saying "Young and lettuce" during the dubsteppy part
SAW A FOB ADD BEFORE THIS
Rock is over
The old woman who's in the music video to 'irresistible' is in this
I hate the people who say they like old FOB music better. Give it 10 years then this will be considered "old". All FOB music is creative and extremely good.
at 1:10 I always understand "eat your medicine"
You all need to chill. It's their music, not yours.
at first i dident like it but the more i listen to the more it grows on me like a tumor
so bad that it is hilarious! xD funny stuff guys keep it shitty
I knew I wouldn't hear any rock
Right about 3:05 i get chills and wanna cry when the little boy cries....
one of my new favorite songs
They deserve more views!!!
no no no they need to go back to the old days like sugar where going down hill
the loopin is real
THIS IS AMAZING OH MAH LORD I LOVE IT
WTF?!?!?! What is this?? Why do all my favorite bands have to sell out?! They don't even TRY to be good!!! Yeah, I know: those brainwashed fangirls are going to kill me, but I just HAD to get it out!!!
ill never understand how people could hate on any music fall out boy does. but then again im kinda biased. patrick could blow his nose into the mic and id be like yes. i can see the artistic turn they’re taking
nothing short of brilliant
what the fuck is this gay shit
this kid has been doing some druggos
I think brendon would be able to sing remixed part
This is the worst song ever. Anyone that comes at me for this. Save it.
When are you coming to ENGLAND!!!
When you get an ad for fall out boy before fall out boy
That moment when the ad before the video is for their song😂😂
What the hell is this..?! 😵😵
I'm so glad that "Oops I did it again" finally has a different continuation to "I played with your heart" 😂😂😂
is this fall out boy?
2:29 That kid be like "This is not older Fall Out Boy"
Sooo good listening to it over and over again
I relate to the main character: running away from what Fall Out Boy became with this song... *hides with Believers Never Die, Folie à Deux, Infinity on High, From Under the Cork Tree, and Take This to Your Grave*
How does one even sing the chorus to this song??
My friend: Have you heard the new FOB song yet? Me: Yeah, it sucks. It's so bad compared to their normal stuff. Also me: *Plays new FOB song*
He's the one doing the taking
Yo Mike?!?! Is that you?
taking butt...
cant you just go on PC if you want to drop out a gang
Youtube finally recommended me something good.   After watching this I had to Subscribe, and turn the notifications on. This kind of information, is priceless.
Why can't dudes like this make millions on YouTube instead of stupid girls giving makeup tips?
"Take your butt" LMAO
And don't chew your food with your mouf open. That is a sign that you may want a dick or some asshole in your mouth.
LMFAO..... THIS DUDE SOUNDS LIKE MIKE TYSON.  AND HE IS TALKING ALL ABOUT PRISON AND WEARING A SEX ADDICT SHIRT.
What if you go to prison with a penis surgically grafted to your forehead?
i got here through a Mike Tyson video!
This is so informative and useful. Thank you.
this ace did a dime, respect OG
Don't drop the thoap
big herc is the fuckin man.... bustin cheeks
Just stay outta prison !
How dumb is this dude...his statements are so contradictory...smh
don't be a Peter gazer
I spat out my fucking drink 😂
watch out for the bootie warriors.
you have nothing to worry. says the 150 kg gigantic black man.
wear the soap around your neck like a chain and it won't make it to the floor
LMAO.. don't drop the soap
Wtf is a deli situation
he sounds like Mike Tyson 😅
dropping the soap lol
"That new muthafucka in C block think he hard, il show him how to respect. I'm gonna rape his butt until the room stinks, and then I'm gonna eat his butt in the stink until my stomach is... full of butt."
fleece Johnson- "Booty is more important than water."
I just joined a gang, the l.d.b krew! long dick boys,  my mouth was sore when I first joined but went away.
Lmao prison niggas are gay af they just trying to look for a reason.
all i could think of is that boondocks episode when tom dropped the soap...lol
he got his cheeks took for sure knows how it goes step by step
I'll just buy a bunch of soap on a rope and if I drop it in the prison shower I'll pick it up with my toes
"Hey homie you gotta let me get summa that."
Federal prisons are for White collar crimes... Try 10 years in a State Maximum Security Prison....
what if u just CROUCH like a catcher, so ur butt is always parallel to the floor? lol.
Better put on some superglue in ur ass before u go prison. I'm following the law
"If you in ta that... they got some HARD DI*K for them butt cheeks". 😭😭😭😭😭😭
"Petergazer", and "Butt cheekths". I can't anymore. 😂
"Get you a couple feet books, beat your meat, and you'll be alright."
"motherfuckers get knocked out and get they butt took" 😂😂😂😂 Fucken dead!
when I was in prison I never drop the soap, I used to drop the shampoo cus it took alot longer to pick up. nohomo
butt cheeks gone be clenched so tight a mf gone need a crowbar to get in that bitch
i lost my wife to this guy
Don't get caught peter gazing.... lol. Took me a second to get what he's saying. I imagine prison shower isn't the place to see if you stack up.
People actually bang other men in prison??
Don't gotta worry about people trying to get them cheeks when you're built like Green Mile dude
this is incredible. totally addictive series. "gettin they butt took" im dying over here
This shit was so funny lmao
This guy needs to have definitions for each of those slang terms. A prison urban dictionary
Solution for dropping a soap in prison...Soap on a Rope. You're welcome.
get them cheeks busted
This is the best video of all time, especially the 2nd segment.  I am in tears.    Mad props Big Herc.  Peace and Respect.
Flex your ass so they can't take it
this fella is funny! 😂
🤣 knock u out and take your butt! 😂 leave u buttless! 😂 they gonna use your but as a pillow.
Bro this guy talks some real shit
😂 dont drop the dove! soaps man! 😂 or else you'll get a foot long sub! 😂 with mayonnaise
What if you drop a Dove soap bar, those things are so good.
Just let that shot float away... wise words from a wise man 😂
Dis was da funniest shit iv ever seen in my life hahahaha
Lol he said I ain't got nothing against punks
If you loose your butt as a man you gotta either kill him or kill yourself there is no in between
This vid almost killed me 😂😂😂
He talked like he just know we going to jail
If you dropped the gang on the streets what's up then?
damn... when he was like "heehee" haha I lost it. I learned some slang today though. "Peter gazer" is finna be my go to for awhile now
"They got some hard dick for them butt cheeks" 😂😂😂😂😂
Big hurk what whaaaaat!!!!!
Pure comedy
"And they'll come back and fuck you up" hahahahahahahaha
these vids are to much lmfao
If your dick wakes up and erects to a  man's ass, you are gay even without being fucked ever by other men.
PAY ATTENTION. BABY!
🤣😅😂 in other words never take a shower
His voice and the way he carries himself is sus.
So in prison when you drop the soap you gonna drop it like it's hot
If someone comes for your cheeks better break their dick in half, let a nigga try run up on me like that bet it won't happen again
hey man, you gottalet me get some of that😂
KAKAKKAKAKA
Really funny :-)
shows how broken shit is, men have way less rights than women
Her working for 90K is great punishment. Do we know what her line of work is? I hope it's minimum wage.
it's profitable to lie in US :-)
I thought the system was FUCKING SEXIST! Feminism is such a fucking sick joke. FUCK I hate humanity.
WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
how ya gonna get even while she is in  Jail???
Show this to these feminist douche bags on Instagram
Anyone that thinks that men are all privileged is an idiot.
Wow, just like a woman she blamed someone else, her mother and didn't come clean until the lies were found out.
90 Thousand? WHAT THE FUCK?!  Dude served as a rapist in prison for FOUR YEARS? And the only restitution is 90 THOUSAND?! What kinda shit is this?!
i'd pay that 90K to a good hit man to kill the bitch.
She should go in prison for 4,5 years and pay him for wasting his teenage/adult years in prison
What a fat lying pig
We all understand that lying under oath means absolutely nothing after "Cool Sax" Billy Clinton.
they cant give her full punnishment because then it stops the real victims from coming forward in the future.....
She isn't sorry at all she had a huge fucking smirk on her face the fat whale!
fuck this bitch and the judge that gave her the sentence. she should get minimum 4.5 years
What a fat goon
Fuck that fat ugly cunt.
Thanks Liberals and modern Feminist for this stupid ass shit.
What a terrible balance of justice.
And people trust the courts to hand out justice with death sentences.
whoever first found the man guilty of this must be retarded or blind. Did they not get a look at her? whos gonna sexually assault that
I'm so angry at seeing this... I can't form a rational comment.......... I don't want hear another godamned woman complain about any feminist equality bullshit.... so help me god.
I m the best judge, i would give minimum 2 years for confession.
I know her, don't worry. I can sort this out. Hehe.
People hitting dislike on the video is just sad. Don't discourage the creator of the video because the report on the content you don't like.
We should do a public shaming.
If she tried that shit with a criminal, she would be found in a dumpster or on the side of the road.
Where are the feminist bitches at?? huh!
"She should be given credit for coming forward." Yes. so 1 point for coming foreard, now when ee tally that up versus the -45,000,000 points she is at for lying a guy into jail for 4.5 years. What a piece of shit.
How could any judge believe that woman was raped??? You'd have to gouge someone's eyes out before they even consider sticking anything in this ugly hefer.
We need to have a survivor style system implemented where we can vote these people off the continent.
"BUT MALE PRIVILEGE"
GIVE HER 10 YEARS!!!
Everything about this is gross.
who want to rape this dinosaur?
Who in their right mind would sexually assault this hog beast? WTF?
the 2 months and $90,000 is a criminal sentence... can't he sue her civilly?
Female Privilege is real.
as long as they completely wipe his record clean i see no problem, plus if he really wants to, he can go after her for more money, im sure.
fuck her mom  fuck her fuck her lawyer  money runs this kangaroo court system
Mom sounds like a dumb Christian.
She deserves to get raped.
He should still sue her for everything he legally can.
She should be raped to death
Pirate law = The false accusation of a crime serves the same punishment as the crime in question... well fuck pirates are the good guys
Tell me more about male privilege ladies.
listen and believe they said
I find it sick you can convict someone only on the word of a person who could just as easily be lying as the very person they are accusing with no evidence.
Yet, if you even question someone claiming to be raped, people criticize you for "victim blaming."  "How dare you question the truthfulness of this traumatized woman?!"    "Because sometimes bitches be lying."
shes a fucking whale
makes me feel phisicaly sick seeing injustice. : (
I hope she gets raped for real
Fuck that attorney. Take his license away.
What COMPLETE BULLSHIT.
Who would rape that whale?
dont dislike, its not the news's fault
This is a smack in the face to every single man that has to face being told how privileged and oppressive they are day-in, day-out.
Here's an idea; give her the same sentence he was given without telling her she will be doing the amount that he served.
The judge & jury actually believing someone would 'sexually assault' this fat ass is mind blowing.
Women yells Oppression oppression oppression, I see a man falsely accused.
WTF? What is wrong with someone who will ruin another's life just to CYA?
"Before you get sentenced, what would you like to say to Jonathan?" *Smirk/eyeroll* Queue rehearsed bs response. I think that says it all right there.
Come on!! at least 2 years
Wow... fuck her.
As if anyone would rape that fat slob.
Fry this bitch!
> just her word against his  Fucking. Lol. What kind of courts are Americans running? Burden of proof? Presumption of innocence? Evidence? Witnesses?
SHE ONLY SERVES HER SENTENCE ON THE WEEKENDS, unfckn real.
That fat, ugly troll should be buried under the prison. She looks exactly like the sort of attention starved, desperate pig that I imagine does this shit.
Welcome to the AGE OF PROFESSIONAL VICTIMS
They should take her pointer finger off
Why would anyone rape that disgusting  fucking walrus. If some lard bag pulled that shit on me I would light her fucking ass on fire in the court room. Then I would kill that dumb nigger judge.
She should have to pay AT LEAST 200k.
1/3 of people actually understand how "thumb's up" and "thumb's down" work.
F%$K THAT.  She should get the exact same he would get.  They want equality so it's time to show them what equality means.
equality my fucking ass
She should get 9 years.. double his time served.
hyuhvj Hobbits ugfx

OMG that Spongebob and Patrick poster! LOL
4:50 Panty shot
Wow the new Yandere Sim update looks great!
probably the worse TTT video the yogs have made. FFS, the time stopper terrorist ability needs to be outlawed.
lewis' melon bomb/c4 play made me very happy :)
Has Pyrion ever acknowledged himself making a mistake or doing a wrong?
ahaha i love lewis's anime girl voice XD
Is this what the full release of yandere simulator will look like?
This is one of the best EPs
That's Yandere-chan isn't it?
Love Yogscast but please no more trash anime in the Sacred TTT
That was some good 'poonin!
Where is Simon?
Now they need to play yandere simulator
YOGSCAST WE WANT MORE DUTCH SWEARING IM DUTCH MESELF
So they finally fixed it the server so that is they can actually shoot each other but they chose a map with no guns.
weebiest shit ever, fucking za waurdo and yandere sim.
lol shooting up a school....
Pyrion: "There's a pair of underpants here... oh no, it's a deagle."
is that the yandere simulator map?
tfw genj is a ninja and not a samurai
This just shows what a joke anime is nowadays. Mainly the reason I don't like it at all anymore.
more sjin less pyrion... sorry pyrion
Pyrion continues his streak as the world's worst detective.
Burn the weebs.
Nice try Lewis I saw that one melon miss.  You didn't get a kill for every shot.
sick of TTT where is simon where is minecraft?
9:30... anime Spongebob and Patrick?
What happened to Minecraft kingdoms
Where's Simon to go "AGUUUUU"
yandere simulator map? ok then....
YES YANDERE SIM!
This is amazing XDDDDD
yandere simulator !!!! its from that game
Get in the fucking robot, Sjinji
japanese high school with non sliding doors?
in my country bodega means storeroom or the attic
guessing they never played yandere simulator. xD  edit: nevermind. sjin and tom know of it.
where is simon?
oh shit! the ganjo sword!
I thought Lewis was just a normal guy, but after this video, I've realised the truth... He's a closet weaboo
Yandere Simulator anyone?
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks.
8:17  "Ho ho ho, try and get - AH!" Last Words
Yandere chan x5...the world is doomed
"TTT" Or "Trouble in tit town" Cause that is what anime is right?
Bet They Love Shooting Up The School.
They Want To Die in This One.
Pyrion- "Is it you?" Zylus- "No." Rythian- "Yes." Pyrion- *Kills Rythian* Rythian- *Innocent* Pyrion- "Oh shit. He was innocent." Pyrion- *Kills Zylus* Zylus- *Innocent* Pyrion- Oh shit. Well, im out of ideas."
YANDEREDEV! YANDEREDEV!
Have they not played Yandere simulator beforehand?
4:53 well...
Where is Simon?
anyone still remember the yog cave and bearsh?
kinda surprised Pyrion went anywhere near this map, tbh.
Was so happy when Sjin killed Duncan because he had to be a try hard with the dub step gun.
They made a yanderesim map?
Has Duncan ever played Yandere Simulator?
11:07 420 YOLO SWAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Well im ready to see yogscast the anime
Omg pyrion is so bad why
this episode should've been called 4 melons 4 kills
too cringy for me, the words they use, the title, the total yandere killing theme, and the rest. but not more cringier than lost pause. the vid is still good.
what skin was that green armor right at the start?
5 anime schoolgirls... and a drilldo.
This is so messed up wth
0:57 Yes Tom, this is pretty scary...
its from yanderee sim its an anime school for both boys and girls and yanderees only goal is kill
I liked how Zylus was just slashing around with that sword not hitting anyone whilst managing not to get shot.
Were is Simon?
"I found lewis here I guess he got sworded." I guess you could say Lewis is sword of bad at TiTT
use a dillo on those girls
more yoglabs pls
I haven't seen a video pop up from this channel in months, then this one decided to pop up..
pryion is literally the worst at this as to be expected
Looking up girls skirts , that is what amines like SNK and death note as well as bunch of others
So fitting that Bodega was a shit detective.
I got so triggered by them all making fun of anime.
plz sub to me
I love Pyrion.  " Help! I've just got a chair for company... AHHHHH I'M BURRRNING!"
Everyone theres a chainsaw murder in the girls highschool, oh wait it isn't jason, were fine
I'd love to see an alien themed map

Casey you have the biggest heart! 💗 I love that you have dogs there for adoption. Such a good idea!!
I think it would be cool if you donated / gave away makeup to your supporters!
Living for the spotlight palette wall at your meetup 😍😍😍😍
You buy new home in NY....how long will you be there?
What song is at 2:18?! 😭 can't figure it out
I was hoping you filmed Davis sucking helium lol! #snapchatfam 
Garage sales r a lot of work!! Good luck. This makes me miss living in a house-tired of living in apartment.
Anyone know what kind of dog Daisy is??
So strange seeing you move out of your home...I remember when you got that house! But excited for this new adventure for you :)
Girl if I didn't live in Indiana I'd be at the yard sale💜😂 #snapchatfam
Wow look at how much freedom of speech i have here. My last two comments were erased by the fascist/comi moderator.
Hillary supporters are such creeps
Winning !  The snowflakes butts are hurting !  MAGA !
Ooops......didn't know he was at a White Power Rally LOL
the land of the free ?? at who's cost and at who's word ??? land of free speech ??? he's talking about veterans he ran from doing service he's a draft dodger coward ??
I'm in this video. We weren't violent with the man. We just kept him from going after anyone. The police dealt with it from there and the man was able to tell his side to the media.
I though the campaign was over... wtf is this?
Trumpeteers accept white Trump supporters only. Message to non-white Trumpeteers: You are so screwed.
Mike Pence was sounding pretty good at the start of the rally,  I hope he runs for  President in 2024.
We haven't seen a rally like this since nuremberg 1938.
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show....
Shouldn't those bikers be wearing BROWN shirts?  Jes' sayin'...
snowflake Trumpists do this protesters (who have the right of free speech) and cry river when ANTIFA whoop their a**. Maybe you are triggered by antifa because you are a fascist?
Interesting - police siding with fascists....how typical
100 Days of Record setting Accomplishments The #Lamestream media and other #FakeNews #LiberalLunatics Don't Want You To Know About can be read at www.whitehouse.gov Statements & Releases
Thank you, my brothers and sisters [ of #BikersforTrump2016 ] - for helping the law enforcement remove the uninvited trespassers.
I thought Trump Supporters were pro 1st amendment. guess that was just another lie.
I thought you guys loved free speech?
Trump's nazi brown shirts. It's here Amerikkka, it's here.
Why do Trump rallies get so violent? This never happened to Bernie's rallies.  I would mention Clinton's, but her rallies were just dinners with her Millionaire donors.
All I see is a bunch of morons throwing people out for being smarter than them. Seeing the inbreds herd themselves around the guy at the :30 second mark is all the confirmation you need as to how idiotic they are.
Look at the police manhandle anybody that's anti-Trump.  This is why I have no respect for police and never mourn for police either.  They are just as bad as criminals.
these freaks are horrifying
USA USA USA: no different than Seig Heil.
All Trump supporters should be rounded up, have their skin removed, set on fire, thrown in a pool of sewage, then slowly left to starve to death... Pure fucking scum.
These people are fucking un-American cucks, and I'm not talking about the protestors.
WHAT A PRESIDENT OF THE USA. GOD BLESS US ALL. We really Need you right now,
TRUMP IS A FAG, TRUMP IS A FAG, TRUMP IS A FAG
Land of the free...
So proud of these resistors!  Stand tall against Cheeto Mussolini!
His chronically stupid supporters certainly can't take criticism. Much like their ego tripping leader.
Why Trump likes the poorly educated !
Wow a government silencing its people, not like any country America has been strictly against did that... oh wait
Oh that pesky 1st amendment! tRump should get rid of it.
America has turned into a banana republic
Courageous citizen advocates - thank you for your service
What was the deal with the guy at .50 ? I was up above watching & I had no idea what he had done
Yeah!!! Remove the Killiary's zombie
Leave it to Pennlive to focus on a HANDFUL of protesters and ignore the 10,000 people in the arena.  I was there and it was a huge lovefest.  😃
GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP AND GOD BLESS AMERICA !  MAGA  !
Trump is uniting our country for once and not letting the rich people influence his decisions like Obama...God Bless Trump and his blue collar followers
Haters gonna hate
these snowflakes need to be sent to Cuba!!!
YOU FUCKING TRUMP-HATERS  ARE GONNA GO DOWN because I  take you out likelike a WILD WESTERN GUN FIGHT or even Pirate battle ,pillaging you make sure your ship sinks to DAVY JONES LOCKER, HA ARRRRRRRGH!

Lamelo kept passing it to that darkskin nigga that can't shoot

Big ballers team are not that good also they foul so bad they don't call no fouls on lamelo
He arrived late and didn't get benched ?
Those kids hella annoying
That one darkskinned dude on the white team seemed to have the most potential in my opinion, Black squad is just a better team but none are  overly talented.

How do you customize the cards with your logo? It shows it in the video but only allows for a generic icon choice? Any help is appreciated.
I did not ask for this to be put on my computer. There appears to be no way to delete this video which starts every time I open my  computer. My advice:go directly to the website of organization you wish to support.
"I really would like to give to this cause as I teach GED to wayward young African American males ages 16-21 in the Chicagoland area..." TD ?????? (HOW)
omg!! now when i'll make videos i'll be making the world a better place! Thanks for share
Really thanks
so, tell us how to implement this "donation card" ... there is Not Enough specific information in this video.
So many questions! How are payments remitted? Is there a way to change the time when the card pops up? Right now its coming up at the beginning of the video.
You guys are AWESOME!!! Great idea! Going to start putting this on our videos.
How do I actually do this? I just tried on my video and it sent me to a card screen but didn't have a donations aspect.
Is available only for US NGOs or worldwide?
When a camera cost more than your car, PC and all your furniture combined and doesn't come with a battery.
When that camera is worth more than your life
#LinusAngerManagementTips
$138,000 to be the most "privileged" person on the planet. Seems worth it.  Seriously though, this is my favorite video by far.
i had a bad day so i had to watch this again to cheer me up
Hey guys May the 4th be with you today! Also I love this channel and my channel, you can go kick rocks if you don't.
I Don't know Why I'm Worried Even It's Not My Money But.. Shaaaaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee RED What The Fuck IS Wrong/...... No Audio Output.. Please Just Don't.
I understand future proofing but why spend 138,000 for a camera that's not of use yet?
watching this video really hurts
oh so this is where the ad money goes to...  right
Watching in 720p
I have been or my company for that matter... had been charged 300$ for an 10cm ish chain
So why'd you buy it dude?!
this video is the funniest thing I've seen from Linus
man too bad my white male privileged doesn't cover the cost of the camera
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess RED IS NOT sponsoring this video...
african children could have eazen that camera
Linus just got rapped...ahhhm ripped...
10:59 the saliva of discord.
make a pc out of that box , will look cool
Instead of like button wish youtube has lol button......... Fucking 60000$ hahahahahaha
Rage Linus is the best Linus. Wil pay youtube red for that shit
I watched this yesterday. But just for the lulz, here I go again. This video is hilarious.
I am going to say one word to discribe Linus's mood in this video: "TRIGGERD".
Hmmm, buy a house and a car or two camera's?
2-4 years and you'r Phone can do 8K videos and you will thing " What the @$&(*"? why dis i spend a house for that pice of bullsh*t"
LinusRageTips  Love it.
this episode linus vs $5 MACHETE (0:30)
holy shit that's insane! give one of those carry cases to luke to make a mini system in. could be a good vid...
Can someone make a bleep count plz
Holy shit I'm dying rn watching this shit
After watching this video, I just uninstalled my ad blocker. I could feel the $$$$$ the pain.
just get a sony rx100 m4
Wow, you seemed so angry throughout the video. Since 8k monitors are probably pretty rare at this point since they're about 5000 dollars. Why was the decision to even buy this stuff made?
If you think they are assholes to charge you that much for crap like this, just remember, it's asshole like you that's paying for shit like this to keep those assholes in business.
I'm starting to think that Linus bought this just to get pissed at it
Biggest waste of money I have ever seen. I don't believe in any way this will make LTT videos better.
Red, Don;t give Apple idea's otherwise we might see a $1000 iPhone cable next
When a camera cost more than your car, PC and all your furniture combined plus no Battery and without freakin' RGB
Um... Who else thinks that he's a bit angry?
when a battery costs more than your life
Why did you bought it???????
Why is there such a difference between the video and ad volume.
Someones pissed off that his attempts to extort them out of free shit like he does with everyone else failed.
this was to funny... :))))))))))))))
I don't think I've ever seen Linus so worked up before.
what the hell is wrong with red  they sell you a $2750 7 inch screen that is only 1080p
I hear MKBHD has 3 of them already
I get the record as high as possible, but at camera cost > $10k, I'd think you could say 4k is enough for a silly youtuber...
Complete bullshit of money.
Should have a running "Privilege" counter, lol. I'm dying.
hmmm 50g just for the camera, and then thousands more for the accesories... so how much do we have to spend on computer now that will be able to edit the red footage?? i cant even imagine...
I hope that they included a 30 years warranty with it lmao
my brain cant even comprehend those numbers
and I thought apple were ripping off their customers. they are though.
tell the BBB and your friends that RED is over inflating their products
I guess Linus thinks its cheap? ;)
Why the F*** did u even buy this piece of CRAP! These guys should have gone outta business long ago👎👎👎
Lmfao I love this video best one yet
This camera with accesories costs more than some small appartments in Europe... Cheesus Christ!
My guess is Brandon kitted this out and he was filming all the Linus rage at the 250,000 he made him drop.
as of now NO monitors, graphics card, smartphones and LED TVs has 8K support
kinda show off-ish :P But I do want one.
sakit sa heart to the maximum level..hahahahhahaha
Red weapon is what they use for the avengers movies
Wow u made red seem like the most corrupt company out there. They have everything over priced and proprietary. Which begs the question... why did u do it?
hey linus... y so much ranting? Did you ask 'em the camera for free and you finally found someone making you pay for yor toys ? don't you know how the world of pro+ stuff works ?
I think it is the Sennheiser of camera.
a mad Linus is a funny Linus
a non-stop laugh on this Mr. Linus. LOL for this...hahahahahhahaha :D
i think you can feed all the starving people in Africa.. for the money you spend on that bit*h of a camera..stop making the mf money hungry corporate a**holes richer than they already are...
How many days does it take to render the videos shot by that thing?
1:50-2:25 Somehow, you can almost hear him curse Brandon under every breath  I really would liked to know if RED reached out to him after this video lol
What no blowjob??? Oh that's it....never buying a Red Camera.......BTW this is one of the best and funniest vids I've seen in a while, I love this channel!!!!
letting yourself getting robbed so the others doesn't have a same experience
Did you sell your house for this shit????
if Linus drop this camera. I don't know what my reaction would be.
the camera and all of the accessories is made of diamonds and gold from a dying star
WHY DID WE BUY TWO OF THEM!!!!!....lol
shit like this is made for television and cinema, not for average joe and youtubers.. what the fuck do you expect?
Next comes 8k 📷.The holy of holies. The holy Grail of Linus Tech Tips.
One giant fucking tax right off.... and he wanted to compete with MKBHD
Brandon gets to use all linus's money on cameras, best job in history.
THE MOST entertaining video I've seen so far on LTT. The first HOLY $H!T VIDEO where I actually said "HOLY SHIT" (multiple times).
Suddenly Apple feels rather generous...  I dunno whether I should like or dislike. I feel so frigging sorry for Linus! :(
Apple, is that you?
The British equivalent of this is, of course, the Doctor Who Quarry.
Wow how about that
You know what's remarkable is how much England looks in no way like Southern California. (Austin Powers)
This is a weird question but.. did you film this with a drone? or was the steadicam guy just making very drone-like movements?
UFO @ 20 seconds
How'd you get that red line thingy to appear and disappear?  Are you some kind of psychic magician ore something?
Unions suck for many reasons
There was a Sci-Fi Alien movie ad for this video... (Alien Covenant.)
why is he talking like he is so tired?
We have the same here in France. For Paris its 50km
We have the same in France. For Paris its 50km
It bugs me how he sounds like he's out of breath but awesome video
TL;Dr They are cheap
bro wtf how did u teleport at the end?? did u magic?
MANY? SOME? ... NOT ... "ALL"     ...   I think Game of Thrones would look pretty silly filmed in California. Or zombies roaming the pacific ocean coast in 'The Walking Dead'.
A dying breed: youtubers who make objective, cool and informative videos.
I saw the title and thought it was boring and then I saw how tmz got their name and I was so excited      LeL
What I'm hearing is that the zone size needs to be doubled to about 60 miles so we can have less scene redundancy.
Informative as always. Thanks.
can Mexicans cross it? Trump can build a wall with that red line.
Dude, SPOILERS.. poor bill and ted
That's some incredible CGI for a short informational video.
Another example of unions ruining something, smh. Thanks for the info, Tom Scott.
"Where the walls fell for Captain Picard". This is the second time I am impressed with your knowledge of Star Trek. Brilliant reference.
Should I listen to this white male?
Those rocks I have been seeing in TV and Movies since the 60's.
Damn, I thought the wonky camera movement was that you where filming on a drone and you would fly up over the area, not just to not have to do proper camera tracking :P
Your left shoe's shadow wasn't teleported ^-^
There's a place in Iceland that would make a good scene for Martian soil as it is all red without a tree in sight.
I like you but them shoes have to go
Genuinely learnt something new! Didn't know about the Thirty Mile Zone
SHAKAR, When the walls fell!
WHOA, WHOA! Spoiler alert on the Bill and Ted reference. Geez.
A lot of alien planets with forests look like Stanley Park in Vancouver... for a very good reason!
I did hear that California in particular became a big film area because of the diversity of natural landscapes (beach, rolling hills, dense forest, desert) in close proximity, but didn't know specifically about the TMZ!
Next up: Why in Hollywood movies gravity on other planets appear the same as on planet earth. Spoiler: Because it is filmed on earth, doh!
Did anyone take the time to see the dolphin at 1:01 on the left?
The ending was pure gold !
I like The Weeknd's new video.
I did not know that! 8)
I saw an aeroplane in the corner and thought it was a speck on my screen and wiped it 😂😂😂
They also all speak English, they don't teach us in school how big the British Empire really was!   There weren't ANY suns that set on the British Empire!
I didn't know that.
This guy needs his own TV show🙃
That is wild stuff, I did not know that, yahaa... :)
Snappy, but loaded with info.
I'm a simple comment passing through. Throw religion out. Get smart
I think this rule is also one of the problems of Hollywood productions, because the vegetation looks always very similar.
As an amateur VFX nerd, I say that was nice work.
No red shir... aw damnit!
TMZ just made a whole lot more sense
darmok and jalad at tanagra
TMZ = thirty-mile zone  That info nugget was worth my time, right there
Tenagra. when the walls fell.
Carbon footprint.
missed a brilliant topical joke of your beam out beaming you 2 feet away :(
Not all alien planets look like places in the Thirty-Mile Zone. A lot of them look like places just outside of Vancouver.
Ohhh so it's a labor contract thing
"Hollywood is a union town" – cue the cries of "Socialism is a cancer strangling entertainment freedom!" or whatever.
So there is no end the the fakery
Those special fx though
Is it just me or is it kind of satisfying that you can make out where Tom's outline has been filled in to make it look like he vanished at the end of the video?
That graphic of the zone border really added to the video. Props to the editor who came up with that one
i love you tom you gigantic nerd
Another great video filled with info I didn't know about Tom. Cheers :)
Shut up already
You looked so smug reading that last sentence.  I would be too, was a great closer.
Reminds me of Austin Powers, "Isn't it amazing how the hills of England look in no way like those of Southern California?"
Whenever the agents on NCIS are in the country the terrain and the plants look like Southern California where I grew up.
wait wait wait, TMZ is called TMZ because of the 30mile zone. WTH?
Shaka, when the walls fell.
0o0 He beamed up. Must have been picked up by the enterprise. Now I want to call him Tom Scottie!
How is he so good at finding things I probably didn't know?!
Darmok and Jelad and Tenagra..... when the walls fell!
I learnt about this in class (in Hollywood? 2ish months ago :')
Tee Em Zed*
Wow! The TMZ connection blew my mind for some reason
"zee" Come on, Tom.
You're everywhere.
He has reminded me of something. I guess I now have to binge Star Trek on Netflix. Live long and prosper !V!.
"And that is something I might not have known". Sorry, it just didn't feel the same without it in the end :)
...and that is something, you might not have known.
so did you have to pay matt extra to drive you up there?
Massive props for those editing effects. Spot-on tracking right there, especially without a tripod.
glad to see you back Tom. hope all is well
Hollywood is a stinking bastion of communism ... those 30 miles were better back when they were orange groves.
my sister walked behind me while i was watching this and said you are cute :/

I LOVED your hair after the shoot tied up in that bun, naturally messy bun is the best!
Your hair looks a different shade in this vlog, are you using a different toner?
So interesting she did knives on the left - as I think that's the way they do it in America..! (That's how my sister has it anyway haha) Xxx
Constantly living for Louise's weekly vlogs! <3
It makes me so happy to see Marie so radiant, happy and healthy! Sadie is absolutely gorgeous! ✨
Ahhh I loved the location of your photo shoot & with the floral dress it reminded me of Alice in wonderland! Beautiful 😍

That white floral dress is just perfect! I might buy it for my bridal shower and rehearsal dinner.
Louise always makes the most interesting vlogs! I never get bored! 😍 loving your hair!!! 💇❤️
Hope you feel better, Louise x
Don't be deceived by the lego castle! It's very difficult and intricate to build! I got it about a year ago and haven't had the heart to dismantle it yet.
Happy birthday sorry it's late xxx
GIrlfriend, just you keep on keeping on :) you're keeping your life happy, and successful TO YOU! Your chats to us are just gravy :)
Louise at the beginning of the vlogs ,what's the name of the lipstick that you have on. It's lovely.💄💄💄💄💄💄💄
The print on your dressing table is lovely.. where was it from please? 💕☺️
I've accidentally started saying 'shit me' a lot more, but I feel like it makes my life a lot better. Thanks for the influence Louise, you're a star ❤️

I want to come to your new house and eat cereals and chocolate that we don't have in the states.  These are my goals.
"I'm gonna have to select 9 outfits, I'm gonna put one on, for common decency" another one of Louise's iconic phrases of 2k17!

I got caught in that hail with my baby in his pram, needless to say he was dry as a bone whereas I got drenched! Umbrella inside out, one handed pram pushing - doesn't work!
Voted for you... be rude not to really xoxo
With catnip you should put it in an old sock and tie it in and then they'll play with the sock and they can still smell it- just a slightly cleaner way ❤️
The start was loud and woke me up 😂
Happy belated birthday Louise xxxxxxx

I feel so comforted just listening to you talk. You've got such a lovely voice and even on weeks like this I enjoy these snippets of your life. I wish we were friends, but this will do lol enjoy New York!
Aw louise a normal/ low energy/ poopy week is totally fine for us (atleast for me) to watch. I like listening to you talk! No matter if you're at home. :)
I don't know what it was, but Louise looked extra gorgeous in this vlog

I love easy peasy vlogs like this one. never apologize, not apologize for it. It really flucking life! Not every day will be exciting. We enjoy you for being you!
Why don't Zoe & louise spend much time with eachother anymore?☹️
Hi Louise! Can peeps outside the UK vote? 🙂
I feel like 80% of this vlog was Louise nearly falling off things. Very, very relatable :) Happiest birthday to you for last week, and a major YES to straight hair!
Louise can I ask the exact name and shade of the pink in your kitchen? It's the perfect shade of pink I want to paint my bedroom! 💕
I think the photoshoot was for the Glamour Woman of the Year thing 😏
Vlogging is hard so don't apologise! We appreciate all that you do put out and your vlogs never fail to make me smile - I literally just feel great every time I see it in my sub box xx
I love seeing the FUSBAND (old time viewers will get that reference lol!) - he is as charming and lovely as ever :)
Please will you do an updated skincare video! Thanks xx

very good and informative blog thanks , myself and my family are thinking of visiting from the uk at xmas is universal open like Disney on xmas day and what's the weather like in December?
4:24 Why is ode to sleep playing in the background?! I would have been so hyped.
Were going to universal between the 2nd and the 12th of december does anyone know what the lines will be like??
We are arriving at Cabana bay in 3 weeks can't WAIT! love your video guys :) x
Ahhh! That was me and my friend taking the pictures behind the blue wall😂
Is there ever a line for Kong?  Love the magical lizard beast!!!
Going back at the end of July!  I can't wait 😁😁😁 favorite theme park!
4:01 - That's the 'Purple Wall' that a lot of Instagram users are using for their profile pictures.
I'm going to universal on Friday
@thetimtracker There are a lot of weird lizards in Orlando. Last time I went to Disney me and my friend Jack were skateboarding and a little lizard stood on back 2 legs and ran next to us!!! #Dinosaur
@thetimtracker  That Lizard on the rock was a large Redheaded Skink. Native to Florida but pretty rare to see! I'm 23 but have only seen one once when I was like 8 years old.  Born and Raised in Tallahassee, Florida.
ask Jurassic Park if they are missing a lizard!
Hey, I'm going to Universal on May 19th for Gradventure! Wish me luck!
Tim, what do you keep on the end of your Lanyard?
One more time one more time one more time one more time
I'm going to volcano bay opening day are u going to be there ?
That blue water slide near the end looks absolutely terrifying!
I saw the park on Sunday! It looks awesome.
I loved the Magical Bleach part
Really locking forward to the  Vulcano BayVLog!!!! Pleas make a loooooooong vlog :-)
have u checked out the avatar at disney yet
Loved vlog, we went off site to KSC so missed you again.
HAPPY STAR WARS  DAY GUYS, LOVE YOU
I think my favorite line from this Video was when Tim said, "These girls are taking pictures for Instagram in front of a blue wall. Yes, we do have blue walls at Universal" 😂😂😂
get tim where is star wars world going to be.
pretty sure that lizard did a few push ups, def from jersey
kind of looked like a skink but don't think it was. great video
That lizard was so cute! Most exciting animals we get in the UK are ducks LOL
TheTimTracker and TheJennTracker are my all time favorite YouTubers
Robes at Grand Floridian  = $120.  Thanks again for the smiles!
Will u be there on volcano bay open day
Good thing for you guys that you're getting the rain you need so badly! (Having just come out of three years of drought here in Southern California, we fully understand how stressful a drought can be)
Why didn't you get an invite to the opening of The World of Pandora ??
4:03 Ode to Sleep - Twenty One Pilots |-/
Was there in February. Already miss it, especially Hulk. As to that lizard, they have the same huge lizards on the north shore here in Louisiana . The first time I saw one scared the crap out of me.
It would be amazing if you guys did like an early HHN27 Prediction like or update video from given information you know and stuff you want to see there!
aww man I was there all last week. no Tim Tracker in sight
Price paid sir.    Looks like it's going to be a really cool place once it's all finished.
Thank you.  I'm going in June. Learning...
at 4:03 i heard ode to sleep by twenty one pilots in the background but it doesn't sound like the studio version whAT'S GOING ON
I went to Universal on Saturday! I won't be able to go to Volcano Bay on opening weekend or for a while:(
I just recorded a voice over for on the busses.  Its instructional to teach people how setup "TapTu Pay" on your TapuTapu band.
5:40 that thing does better push-ups than me what is this
Volcano Bay is way behind schedule, most areas are still hard hat areas!
I miss the old videos of just you and Jenn going to the parks, hanging out at home and being together.
How many time does it take to visit both of the Harry Potter parts in the two theme parts in Orlando is it okay if I am only going half a day only for both harry potter park ?
Awesome update!!!!!
That looked like an African rainbow lizard.
Man i love that place
Is that music Boards of Canada?
Your videos are always the best!!!, you make my day every time you upload a video!
Maybe the lizard belonged to a kid and he brought it on vacation without his parents knowing. Then the lizard escaped out of his bag and was lost. Eh, or maybe just my imagination....
ON PINS AND NEEDLES WAITING ON VOLCANO BAY
Would love to work for universal Orlando! So many new cool things happening there. Would be awesome to be part of the team there.
when I went I didn't even find getting dry a problem. You stand outside for 10 minutes and it's like you were never even wet.
me and my dad have watched you for awhile and we love disney too and we like your videos alot
That lizard was a Norwegian Ridgeback.
haha "ok im done, i just keep declining... what the heck."
I went on a Friday and there was hardly any crowds and the weather was great
4:10 I actually fell out of my chair. Listen to the background music
@TheTimTracker your videos are awesome please never stop this channel!
Uh oh, one of Newt's crazy mythical creatures is lose at Hogwarts!  haha
great video,great camera
Silly Man... That is why you buy that 80 dollar robe, you are fashionable and sophisticated and warm all in one.  Your Welcome
Had no idea universal had resort buses too. Eh Disney is 100% better and always will be
Oh My Gosh 😲 I was their yesterday
*Auntie Anne's*  Tim's pronunciation- Aunt Annie's   Me: 🤣
do you know if it's going to rain at Universal on Friday
5:20... I thought you guys said "You see that WIZARD?" and I was looking at the rocks trying to find a Hidden Dumbledore, but you guys said LIZARD! Next time, don't mention Hogwarts before you point out reptiles.
And how will Universal have this condtructed by the end of the month?! they are really great at pushing their construction.  I wish Disney would take some pointers
at 6:25 tim got a british accent
The meet and greet at Animal Actors is really cute! They mostly bring out the dogs, but it's still cute to pet them and take pictures with them.
did anyone here top
Tim is so positive and happy constantly. He is also so real! Who else would comment on a bus drivers "fantastic" backing hahaha
Would anyone really get the bus to carpark still in swimwear, then their car would get wet.
Hey, can somebody tell me which Universal hotel has the robots that deliver stuff to your room.
That lizard was doing push ups because it needs to pump itself up!!
Imagine how much water they need/use for landscaping and construction!
That patch of concrete by the barriers had sort of Mickey ears. 😲 3:25
Such an awesome video Tim. Thanks for showing all the new stuff at Universal. I go there all the time so I love all your universal vlogs. Your channel is so great.
so if that part of the hotel is called Bayside, I wonder if Zack, Kelly, Slater, Screech etc will visit?
Het Tim are you planning on going to volcano bay on opening day
love tim.  love your new  bfriend
That a Weird lizard do you know that species
I love when u do these updates can't wait for volcano Bay to open
The buses look terrible from far away.
5:02 Sounds like she's saying "BANANA." Maybe a minion in disguise?
If you have a Universal annual pass, do you have to pay extra for Volcano Bay? Because i have an annual pass and if I could get in for free that would be lit!

I've been in all of those places when I was 10 years old.
Mark: Am I on a boat?  Welp, that doesn't BOAT good
The character to me looks like Frisk from Undertale; Fran Bow from Fran Bow
If those black worms had a fang, I'd say they were taken directly from Out of this World...
His brain was in limbo trying to remember the name Limbo haha
reminds me of Fran Bow
I can't see much it's so dark
What's worse than black goop juice, sentient black goop juice! XD
I love this so much can you make your videos of this😃
the way the little person runs reminds me of Ponyo
This reminds me of little big planet... I have to put it in mute, this guy's voice annoys me. But love the video tho.
I hate when Mark passes things 😭
15:25 "sorry for what?"
The caption sass mark more than they help 😂
ROBO FLUID!!!!!
31:12 Cue The Lonely Island
Hey wanna do a collab with me? I want subscriboars.
when mark stared right at the doll under the bed around 20 minutes in I cringed as he left without acknowledging it
also this reminds me of tim burtons coraline
WHY CANT YOU PLAY SOMETHING NICE AND BRIGHT WITH UNICORNS DANCING ON RAINBOWS
This looks like something Tim burton would do
This game is like the movie Coraline.
I dont like this monster...
The frick why does she/he reminds me of coraline? Maybe its because she has that yellow coat thingy dunno whats called  Yes i know people already commented about that but i just wanna share my opinion about it too :)
This actually give me big nightmares
Pft. After Mark said: 1:21 all I could hear was a Dark Elf from Skyrim saying "YOOR NOT SUPPOS'T BE N HEER!" 29:44 That's < Good
Ghost sans: this is what he get's for even thinking of genocide
You still got it Mark. :D
26:05 HAHAHAHAHAHA😂
This whole video was just me laughing because it felt like Mark's deep voice was coming out of that little 6 year old girl😂😂😂
This does remind me of inside
Mark at 15:50 "jump and grab, i got this like a boss " is this a jacksepticeye thingy or what  also no i don't ship septiplier no problem with it too but i just don't ship it 😅
is this made by the same people who did Limbo and Inside? cuz this game is giving me vibes from those two
If I see ANY comment here talking about Inky and the Bend Machine I swear I'll flip mGOD DAMMIT
Wow ok i was better at this game when I recorded it...I hope...I think?Ah what ever someone just watch my video because IDK.
jerry chairy
How the heck did you break it already
OMG ITS BILL CIPHERS WORLD!!
~hiding in the comments~
Pewds takes forever to notice that the hatch can be opened XD
I LOVE his voice
Mark is just testing the deaths..... :3 so much questions.... xD
I think meep meep
How'd the lighter fit in my tiny hands??
So mark is the game fun so far? You seem to be having fun*Hehehe*
Those legs are MR GABBY legs
This reminds me of nightmare before Christmas. In style and animations.
Hi guys it's my birthday and it will be a present if you could subscribe to my channel thanks you guys are the best!
Has anyone ever noticed Mark do that same thing with his eyebrows in every video right in the beginning when he says "Hello everyone, my name is Markiplier"?
The character reminds me of Coraline the movie
"Im on a boat" haha reminds me of a song
"Im on a boat" haha reminds me of a song
Aren't those black swarmy things Leeches?
hIGHLY APPRECIATES THE EDITING ON MARK TRYING TO REMEMBER LIMBO
*Press F to use lighter* Me:DO YOU GOTTA PRESS B TO BLOW!?!
oh no is mark not sweating anymore? YouTube is dying
I find this utuber really fucking annoying
2:12 already broke the game that deserves a world record
"son of the biscuit "
This is my friend Chair-y! Haha, man...I had a flashback to one of his first playthroughs in which he kept a chair as a friend. Wish I could remember which game that was.
This reminds me of super 8
The legs is a dude or whatever it is that hung itself
MARKIPLYER=HORROR, TEARS, AND JOY.
Mark catch up to things so fast. Omg. His too smart for a youtuber. XD Too intelligent! XD
When he was being chased by the black goop things I was sitting there like, "daSI RUN RUN RUN"       It's from a K-Pop band called BTS you should check them out  ok then I'll be going
I love the animation style of the game. It's so cute and macabre at the same time 0.0 I'm not really a gamer but I really want to get this game now
30:39 "Son of a Biscuit" I just started laughing so much..😂👍
I just dumped my bf, bought a crap load of Chinese food, just so I cant have the perfect night watching Mark :)
I love that movie so much Judy crites I always watched it when I was 5
Mark please play Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild, I am playing it and can attest that it is the best Zelda game ever made, it is open world and it is an amazing beautiful game
wait he played LIMBO I LOVE THAT GAME
anyone see that awesome evenesance cat video?
mark is so foine
Liked for Mark Vietnam flashback
This game looks so similar to Limbo and Inside that I had to check if it was by the same people haha. Looks great! Really excited for this series
Press F for light and Press B to blow
{{SPOILER ALERT}} right before this I watched the part when Sam dies in I Am Legend so I can be sad and shit my pants of behind so scared
Well markiplier would probably die if he yelled so loudly.. xD
So abnormally small children is normal, due to the dead bodies?
Can you stop being a fat litle pussy and play the game and not comment every fucking irrelevent lant thing the fuck?
This game reminds me of Coraline and Inside
when I saw this I thought "Jack should play this it seems like his mind of game and art style"
The character that you play is a girl named "six"
the ink creatures are leeches, you silly goose
I love Mark's Buttery voice lol he's clogging my arteries!
Anyone else thinking about "coralline" cuz of the coat? this is an edit but....oops someone already pointed it out X)
reminds me of the movie 9
The character reminds me of Hoodie
big box Bob is tiny box tim in horror edition
T&J is not highly repetitive!
THIS IS MY FAVORITE THING IN THE WORLD!!!
Im only 11 years old and I still watch theses on DVDs my mom kept for me and my brother when we were little AND I LOVE IT !!

I hate vertical vids but this was fucking hilarious XD
"You look like you were raped by a flag shop" fucking lost it
These two are more MURICA than actual fucking American.
you look like your on vacation...you fit right in with everyone else
I fucking love this guy
I did a quick search of you guys on Periscope. I can't believe you're not on there. Def have to get some scopes going guys.
Not a single American would ever give you shit. All I see is two guys having fun.  That's all anyone would see
Fuck off with ya map.   #USA
fuck off with your map!
The accent makes it even better
Roosterteeth brought me here
If I saw them on the street I'd just put my hand over my heart and start singing the national anthem.
"You look like you were raped by a flagshop" 10/10 best quote
You wouldn't get beaten up, but if you hit a bar like that everyone may buy you drinks.
Hahaha there is no way you would get beaten up, if I saw that I would buy both of you guys a beer.
film in horizontal you maniacs
''raped by a flagshop'' always cracks me up haha
The new ODD COUPLE show ....coming to netflix
1:45 "I'm wearing this"  (Scratches his balls).  LMFAO.  Glad you had fun here. I wasn't sure you'd ever seen the sun before being from England.  LOL.
“ looks like you've been raped by a flag shop " ..... day completed
Pretty sure you'd be just fine wearin' that hahaha.
hahaha the pocket behind the shorts was from stars :'D
what is that guy on. coke?? adderall? love it haha
that's pretty awsome
I reckon a chav accent somewhere.
All about "Paul's" reactions. So good. (I'd totally be with him, too. I feel so bad, lol.)
This is like an exchange between Woody and Gadget from This Is England
Vertical videos are a crime!
Mate we look the balls, i'm tellin ya
Raped by a flag shop!!!
Is this from a Guy Ritchie film? HILARIOUS...!
Aww silly brits, we don't beat people we shoot them.
As staged as this is, they did a fantastic job.
Spit my beer out onto the screen at the "raped by a flag shop" bit.  Very much hope you enjoyed your trip and that you went somewhere, anywhere, in addition to Los Angeles.
Okay... I'm down to watch the rest of said trip.
Needs more stars and stripes.
Vertical video syndrome
I approve. You gents look fucking tits.
These guys are funny together.
I think most Americans would either laugh, or think your getup looks cool. I think you guys look cool.
Fuck off wi'ye map
Funniest shit I've seen in a while.
2:45 "We'll fit right in" "We'll get beaten up" LMAO. You guys looked so stupid, I love it.
This is england flashbacks m8
Honestly, if you didn't hear them talk, you'd blend in perfectly fine, which is a bit sad.
Your staying at the mayflower hotel on 7th and witmer 90017
no doubt they got complimented on those threads man
Ameri'weeabs.
The Monte Carlo to be exact 
This is in Vegas I garuntee it 
Thanks for the bloody good laugh mate.
lol are they gay lovers? Cute couple!
Eugh, that braaaap was horrible! Hahaha, awesome clothes though, you fit in PERFECTLY! :))
m8 we look the balls im telling ya
"we fit right in"
he is so excited that it cracks me up "tap cards, which means we can travel all day long for 24 hours" "i've been up since 330" omg his enthusiasm is awesome
He's one excited lad
this is great
fok off wiy ye map.
"Fresh as a daisy" LOL
Damn! You all have way more American flags on you than I do in my entire house! And I live in the Bible Belt!! Lol XD
ABSOLUTE LEGENDS   
Ah.....ah......LMFAO You guys made my year.  :D
This is like Joey and Chandler from Friends when they went to England. Joey wore that hat and climbed inside the map and Chandler kept making fun of him. Fantastic.
Hahaha this video is great! I want a sequel! 
LMAO WHEN HE WALKS OUT IN THE CLOTHES
I cant believe you talked him into wearing that, to funny.  I am subbing just for that lol.
Brilliant. 
I can honestly say as an American...U GUYS LOOK FUCKING RIDICULOUS!
'I slept for 6 hours on the plane, I'm fresh.' Fuck me that line slayed me.
thought that was a GTA map at first
we dont dress like that..... :(
+ColburnIdiots am american....would not beat you up, and most likely have a laugh (or take the piss) at how ridiculous this is LOL
This was awesome!
it is nice and funny
"Lol thats the guy you want to take on vacation. You wont miss a thing." /u/shyguy002
it was like watching a movie
LOL, im there in 8 weeks, i got to get those shorts
Its pretty difficult to get beat up for dressing weirdly in LA, someone will dress weirder. LA is a great city.
My dude, your balls must be real fucking itchy.
Rooster Teeth :P
the ball scratch tho
HAHA, we fit right it.
"looks like you've been raped by a flagshop"  Fucking love it
What makes daisies an apt metaphor for freshness?
This proves that all couples are the same! 
"I'm fresh as a daisy"
They would fit right in had they been visiting middle of nowhere West Virginia!
https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/album/no-vacancy/id1228948439?i=1228948442&mt=1&app=music&at=1000lvrE GREAT NEWS FOR YOU

Really !! ( OneRepublic ) is one in bands , me favorite best . This song very well !!!  i always clear of them ! ,,, Have All people looking ?
why do all music turn into electromusic? first imagine dragons, now one republic, what's next? linkin park?
The more I listen to the song, the more I like it.
commercial piece of shit, all sounds the same
YOU ARE ALWAYS LEAVE .!
Everyone's commenting on the way Ryan says vacancy? I literally don't notice him saying it weirdly? Is he saying it with an English accent because to me it sounds normal
thunder or no vacancy??
no they cant see
Never been interested in going to a music concert before, but OneRepublic is the only band I will definitely go see, without a doubt! Come to Indonesia pls!!!
The way Ryan pronounces 'Vacancy' is how you pronounce holiday in dutch. 'Vakantie'.
The way Ryan pronounces 'Vacancy' is how you pronounce holiday in dutch. 'Vakantie'.
WHY ALL THIS NEW MUSIC I CAN'T LISTEN TO IT ALL
this song stuck in my mind
replay replay replay again and again !
I mean come on this deserves to be a hit..
Im i the only one that just imagines donald trump sininging this song lol
best part 0.45 to 1.01
The Living Tombtonse
_meanwhile Try to see the music video "stop and stare" you will find "No Vacancy" at minute__1:30_ 😨😱😲😂😂
Name me an Artist better than Don Thrilla and I will probably email you $650
sounds like No VA -CON-CY
love this song
this is my favorite 1R song
man when 1 republic, fob, and x ambassadors and imagine dragons release
This is so good from the moment I know I won't go on vacancy this year 😅
They keep surprising... :-))
Xbox users have been crying the whole video I can relate
I rate One Republic and Imagine Dragons the best bands of all time they deserve much more fame with have quality songs you two are the best
I don't know why, but when I listen to this song, I think about bates motel 😂
Flashbacks for Norman Bates:v
The 27th was pure heaven. New songs from Fall Out Boy, OneRepublic, Imagine Dragons and X Ambassadors. I'm not sure how I survived my own excitement.
palms remind me Mike Bird
Who the honest FUCK is Don Thrilla?

I can't. I just can't deal with this perfection. Why do I cry everytime they release a new song? LOVE U <3

One Republic, Fall out boy foster the people paramore blink-182 oh wonder al time low gorillaz and Imagine Dragons. this is too much
the title is so catchy
Love the way Ryan pronounces "vacancy"
Why does it sound like Starving by Hailee wtf xdd
Am I the only one who thought it was Charlie Puth singing in the starting for a moment?
The beggining of this song sounds like "Cheap thrills"
Fallout Boys<Imagine Dragons<OneRepublic
This is my favoritest band ever !!!💘
I keep hearing "No one can see" xD
I Love this song " No Vacancy" !!!
NO VACANCY COUSE OF YOU.  Hs girlfirned is so fat that she takes all rooms of the hotel to fit in lol

I Love One Republic..They Deserve Grammys. But Somehow This Sounds Like Ed Sheeran-Shape Of You
The starting is little bit same like Shape Of You
First time I heard this the song didn't appeal to meat all. Now I can't get enough of it...  help...
i love it...
I really love this song 😅

Could anyone tell me what type of music this is? The genre? So I can find similar.
you an exploring with Josh are like some of my favourite youtubers! you should totally do a video exploring with him!
My friend would die to go there if it was still alive
wowie I love exploring with josh, his urban exploration videos are amazing. seeing the fact that my favourite storytime youtuber mentioned him was great omg
My inspiration <3
the park closed 2 days after when I was born... should i be scared
Sup chicas there is a awesome makeup giveaway at sites.google.com/site/34ac8b68bf
Colossal sent me here
Love this video!! I love you loey😘
Cutest human ever ❤🍓
i only know about nara dreamland because of nicole dollanganger lol
Who else is watching this REALLY late at night???
I watched this at 2:30 a.m. While raining heavily outside .... haha...
ghost town its dead
I just like your creepy videos! I'm totally facsinated with these abonded places especially big parks like this!
is there a person in the trees at 4:40??
I'm pretty sure my dads been there before like 90% sure ....
OH MY GOD I FORGOT I SET SPEED TO HALF TO LEARN A SONG AND I PLAYED THIS AND WAS VERY SCARED
11 years after closing and they're just starting the demolition
did anyone else hear cal-o-fornia lol love loeys story times :)
Lol, I'm currently in Japan and she said Osaka wrong. 😝😝
Lol, I'm currently in Japan and she said Osaka wrong. 😝😝
4:40 there is a person in the background
This would be a great place to play paintball
Love that you're into urban exploring too!
In the future they're gonna be like, "We don't know who this extravagent castle with expensive toys belonged to, but they must have been really important."
Loey you should do a video on the elevator game!
at 4:43 there is a person in the woods. the person might be a statue but idk still really creepy
Love any conspiracy theory or any creepy abandoned park story ❤❤ love watching this this morning with my morning coffee great start to the day😊❤❤ love from Canada
aww i wish they would not demolish it 😣
Josh went there 😛
You should do a video on the abandoned wizard of oz theme park!
I lived in Japan for so long and never heard of this place wth I'm checking it out when I return 😂
Your shirt is so cute!! <3
I find abandoned parks to be very unsettling, too.  It's like empty buildings.  I think you expressed it well - - they used to be thriving and alive with activity and it just seems so unnatural.
Is it just me, or at 4:44 does it look like there's a figure standing directly to the right of the pole on the boat?
My hometown: WE HAVE HAUNTED HOUSES AND OTHER SCARY TOURIST ATTRACTIONS Me: Meh--catch me on the next round. Japan: WE HAVE CREEPY ABANDONED THEME PARKS RIDDEN WITH PARANORMAL ACTIVITY!! Me: LEGGOOOOO
I love Josh!!

I love the Disney days! Thank you for posting them!
Supposably (from The Proper People who also explored the place) the noise around the boats was the animals around the jungle cruise.
I love how positive she is. she makes everyone happier❤️
Did she chip her tooth?
I want that shirt and I can't find it on forever 21's website, dang it!! 😩
You should read some of the chat stories from those apps!
Loey, do you not have any more personal paranormal experience stories?
The music is kinda loud 🙈
Exploring with Josh is one of my favorite YouTubers ❤️
You look so glowy in this video! 😚

At 4:41 there's a man standing on the right side of the boats, where the trees are.
Yay I love this series

I'm pretty sure that the "strange noises" are just people fucking HAHAHA
That strawberry shirt is so cute, I want one
I love exploring with Josh!

A bunch of racists
this is the best, people coming together for something great, praying and put our lives in his hands is what we had to do long ago not even stopped believing and forget in the 1st place.
where was i to enjoy this wonderful event.
Here I thought New Zealand had alot of sheep.
That's not 1 million people.
god be all like, "you guys made a vow to me, do you remember that day? you all seem to have forgotten"
start by apologizing for all the life of the blacks you killed, then god will  listen
Its Time - CAN A NATION BE BORN IN A DAY !!!
Angus Buchan came to my school last year to pray for rain
we were there
This is amazing. Praise His holly name👐👏
Everyone is calm and orderly.  So who are the people, rioting and burning the country down?
please load us the songs where the people were singing
Millions of people living in fear and genocide for more than 10 years now, I wonder what is next in God's plan for you.
Why don't these idiots gather like this during elections? Instead of praying to a magical man in the sky!
No mess, no fights, no crime.  This is civilized Africa.  Next time invite Zuma.
South African life forever
The deception is strong. Angus is misleading millions of south africans.
i seek the location/??
I count only 111 003 Where are the other 888 997?
blessed blessed!!!!!
I was there and it was truly amazing!!!
literally just a bunch of people talking to themselves 🤔
Zuma has done great things to put these people on their knees
so is this all south africans?
so proud. this is why a country needs God❤❤❤
a prayer for south africa? what did i miss my fellow people?
If aliens are watching over us, they are probably looking down at this and saying "retards"
Only white people huh...?
A single IL-28 could kill everyone there.
Jesus Christ is coming again!!!
this "it's time" really restored hope in me for South Africa and our future lies save in God's hands❤
Awesome. I haven't seen South Africa stand together like this since the 2010 soccer world cup.
looks dry and warm a.f
God bless south africa!!!!!!!!
Tbh,praying isn't gonna do anything...
Does anyone know what was prayed for and is the prayer was answered?
Shit man issa lot of people
Although the intention is good, there is no God listening, sorry.
To God be all the Glory and honor.
Let Jesus take the highest seat. Lead Jesus!
how do you dislike a video like this REALLY!!
AMEN GOD IS GOED!
Save our country.
I was so blessed to be part of this prayer meeting
it's actually just 700 thousand people
what is the song that is with this video?
What an honor to pray with millions for our country!
Thank you for the video.
WOW... what an awesome time we had,thanks for this amazing clip,God bless...
Dit was onbeskryflik
This should happen in every state on the same day.

Didga is very smart, I love her <3
omg this is the most wholesome vid ive seen all day
Awesome video
That's so great ! How did u teach that ? :-)
Amazing Didga!  Easy to see she loves you very much.
OK but how did you train it?!  That's crazy!
HOOMAN BETTER CATCH ME
Omgggggggggg
That is awesome & crazy! I don't think I've ever seen a YT video with NO downvotes. Congrats!
The hell...my comments from earlier was deleted. Okay then lol.
Didga is brilliant and your bond with her is so special.
So much patience and time spent with your kitties. Well done you, and your kitties, showing how well they can learn, and show off their awesome skills. :-)
Cute little guy! I wanna catch him!
I love cats, they make me laugh.  The look on his face is pretty funny. Awesome stuff!
So adorable! I love this trick, might try to teach it to my kitty. ^^
Woooow !!! Bravo you are the best trainer !!! And Didga of course is awesome !!! Love her !!!
cat whisperer
WOW!  AWESOME JOB!  DIDGA IS OUR HERO!!!!!

Gorgeous Didga has total trust in her Dad!!! 🐈😊🌻
This cat is a money maker
Didga is amazing, and so is Boomer. It's awesome that you are promoting pet adoption and shelters ! Such an important thing when there are so many animals already in need of homes. Thank you. #adoptdontshop
OMG MY HEART EXPLODED WITH CUTENESS
So that's where you've been!
so cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OMG Didga is just a super cool and cute and..i cant even find enough words to describe her beauty spirit! love her..and boomer as well :P
Cage is a little coo-coo
the joker is a gift to us from heath ledger
Suicide squad is my fav movie xD
Where's the yung baldow mixtape? :-(
Leto's joker was pathetic. Thankful he barely had any screentime.
Ledger >>>>> Every Joker ever
where's christian bale
Nicolas Cage wasn't sure acting movies
Please hire actors that can fake it.
The speed at which you go from wannabe gangster to flamboyant reality TV star is amazing
he keeps saying 1984 and I'm kinda freaking out because big brother is watching
MatthewSantoro send me that mixtape xD
where is your FIRE MIXTAPE
there is foam in the background
*ahem* Jared Leto *ahem*
actually Jared Leto sending used condoms is not true, while he did send condoms they were not used the director of suicide squad cleared that up some time ago
Keep your. Teefys Matt, keep your teefys. :-)
matt wtf is this song I love it
Then why did leto suck as jocker
Then why did leto suck as jocker
one time when I went to Thornton and i saw a man that had the same kind of mouth as the joker
Helllooo Christian bale the machinist
I lost it at "Yung baldo" 😂😭
The sad part is that Jared Leto still sucked as the Joker
suicide squad is something i hope to forget just like batman v superman. dc in my opinion should stick to comics/games/animation movies/shows
seriously?  i like your channel but your mispronunciations drive me nuts.  NOT sir lawrence Oliver...Olivier ...O-liv-ee-ay. How havd you not heard of him?
Laurence WHAT???
Well for heath ledger going from the joker to being in the Imaginarium of dr. Parnassus  didn't help
Christian Bale was another actor who took a role way too far
If you invert the colours, matt's teeth are pitch black!!!
you forgot about Catman.
going into this like "Heath Ledger. Jared whatever his last name was. The two most recent Jokers have to be on this list or its not correct."
Too bad he still couldn't top Heath as a joker :P RIP
Hate to break it to you but Heath Ledger's overdose was ruled entirely accidental. He had a really bad flu and was mixing pills
Breaking up with your girlfriend for a role? Giving his phone, car and belongings? Uh....that's way too far.
i don't think heath playing the joker is what killed him. he had insomnia and just took too many sleep meds. RIP heath ledger
Laurence Oliver....Oliver...
Dude..., you forgott Christian Bale in The Machinist!!!
9:08 APPLE WATCH I SEE IT
Lawrence Oliver?  His last name is pronounced "oh-live-ee-yay"
There's a urban legend that Jack Nicholson warned Ledger about playing The Joker; not to let the character get inside his head.
he died from heroin
What about the dude who really drowned in the making of Poseidon?
Olivier is pronounced Oh Liv ee ay
Heath Ledger's Joker is my favorite. He wasn't over the top. He was perfect for the roll. It's Jared Leto that I do agree took it to far and personally I think he sucked as the Joker. Also R.I.P Heath Ledger.
why isnt Christian Bale in this one?
Christian Bale in the Machinist
Saw an ad and did not skip it 😁😀
You aren't funny
Did anybody else notice the way he said "joker" at 9:19 ???
You know why Ledger took it too far?  He took it to his grave.
Matthew, are you gonna battle it out with Big Shine ? 😎😁
Who told Matt he was funny cuz his jokes on this video were so cringy
I don't believe the teeth part😂😂😂Cage ain't human, that's more painful than child's birth
You Better follow through on that mixtape 😂😂
Fuck Leto. Ledgend lives on
You didn't mention Christian Bale. How could you?
Hey Matthew! You should add me on sc! It's T_Hizzle Thanks!
So Matt, I see you haven't quit caffeine lol 4:56 . I know those feels.
the simple fact you didn't put Christian Bale on this list makes you look like a noob
being bald ain't easy should be the name of the album matt
so people thought a guy was mentally ill cause he wanted to make music?
jajajaja tha dark knight a superhero movie masterpiece, didn't know you were that funny.
where is chritian bale..the machinist
Wow, Heath Ledger was REALLY good in that film
there is olredy a bolld rapper called chielu . the best rep song is  "lumea sa schimbat"
despite Jared Leto's methods for the Joker, his performance was complete shit
When he said pianist  I thought he said penis
To bad i raped Bellatrix while she was sleeping before she killed me.
I love how the Jokers were put next to each other in the line up
Ewww Shia! Lol.. Na fuck it, I'd still show him a thing or two lol. Lovely looking lad! 🤔😂
Respect to every single actor on this list and best wishes to Matt for his mixtape.
Jared Leto's joker laugh str8 up sounds like squidward
Hasn't every person that played the Joker had a mental disorder?
His name  is pronounce O-live-E-A
Jared Leto is one of the greatest actors of our time.
is this video spedup ?
Didnt Leo DiCaprio sleep in a horse carcass and eat raw bison for the movie "The Revenant"??
500 subs without any videos
I have $40. I'm buying the mixtape
I wonder what strange things Daniel Day Lewis did to prepare himself for his role in The Crucible?!
5 million subscribers and you average 500k a video? Someone's buying dead accounts
If you think I ain't gonna be calling you Young Baldo from now on, you got  another thing coming.
All that work Leto did and he still blew it
Nicholas Cage also ate real cockroaches in the movie Vampire Kiss.
So does this guy actually make his own lists now? Or does he still steal them?
didnt know Leto took the role so seriously... He was pretty good but the movie sucked ass
Hey Matt, I can't do much behind my screen. I'm here with ya man. No matter what. You don't need to try to impress anyone. Here with ya man 👍
4:30 Ammm I apologize....I planned to kill you but you survived.
some pretty expensive ways to trim bushes
Fly those things properly or dont fly at all. Commonsense!
A compilation of shitty pilots
I guess you can't eject out of a helicopter when there is trouble.
When u don't go to flight school in gta
Pilot incompetence in every case.
Jeez and i thought crashing my rc helicopter was bad
when u think about it its actually impressive that people fly this fragile machine at all, and kinda sad we dont have something better yet
Anyone killed or maimed in these?
The last one is the 'Petercopter' from family guy. Went the same way as the 'Peternberg'.
At 6:00 the guy was All Shook Up,,  Aa -aww- huh ,,, - hay -Yay.
At 4 :52 it still looks as if it can fly however.
most of these people must of been totally pissed!!
Video does not say anything about casaulties, I just hope all people survived.
4:07 was that a chicken LOL     Fak fak fak fak
So what tf you suppose to do when your helicopter bout to crash? Pray?
my prayers for there family
Lmao the first one reminds me of BF4 trying to dive bomb and hitting the ground...😂
in a hundred years kids will be watching this video in classrooms wondering how primitive the twenty tens must have been for people to ever get into one of these rotating metal blade death traps to travel somewhere
To the dude at 3:00 (assuming you survived), that is the collective NOT the emergency brake on a sports car. =P
That's just the way some folks do it, everyone's got their own style.   :D
What's with the clowns at 6.10 Those main rotors chose to let go it could get hairy
What exactly happened @ 5:45?
helicopter at 1:59 just wanted to be a dancer
That second video he hit some people! Anybody know if that's the entire video?
I wouldn't call it epic fails. Maybe scary or dipshits.
The life-flight accident at 3:30 is sad...
"Its ok, I know how to fly a Helicopter.... I've played GTA5"
I'm not a pilot, so I don't understand what happened to the one at 5:45.  Is that what they mean by "banging the pole" or something like that?
They are so fucking stupid
These videos are old and nothing new.
I thought helicopters were supposed to go straight up -____-
fuck helicopters
we got black hawk down-we got black hawk down. super 61 down
5:15 I will be a submarine! Don't let anyone tell me otherwise.
"I'm a fat old guy with money, out of my way. OK, where do you put the key?? OK, stand clear!!"
can anyone with helicopter experience explain some of the things that are going wrong?
3:00 why the FUCK would he try take off again? He could have walked away with minimal damage and figured out what the problem was!
billions of dollars so jackasses have toys to play with.
Leonardo, it was a BAD idea.
this is why i flay fixed wing aircraft
#LOGANGFORLIFE
The guy at 2:35 is like the first time you get a remote control helicopter...immediately destroyed along with the $50 bucks.
Helicopters are fing death machines!
6:06, group stupid.
Same old clips over and over
old fucking videos, shame on you.
Did anyone find themselves ducking while the copters was crashing so the blades wouldn't hit you?
0:48 triggered helicopter
Searching for the Black Hawk.....and none here.
This is all TRUMPS fault!
Why don't they just eject? ;)
2:45 here we have the dumbest person to ever try and fly. Your on grass with the BEST landing gear!
5:51 Ever seen a helicopter break  dance?
5:08 Russia's new boat looks sick!
"we report theres a tactical nuclear bomb in the area, i repeat ther........."  "hold on"
Why did the mi28 go down?
Just one little thought of mine, none of these are really "EPIC". In all honesty this is pretty horrible.
What is it with the tails breaking off?
was the helicopter trying to catch a fish
this is why I jump out during battlefield!
Gta makes it seem so easy...
Was that BH pilot hot dogging?
great fucking post. I've maybe seen one of those clips before.
2:16 dumb pilots also its a black hawk down people
Dude at :31 think he was going to catch that thing or what? Mofo it aint a baseball
probably they didn't use the good bud at the time lol ...
I wonder how many died in this vid
It's the adult that let you fly - that should be apologizing.
wholy shit ...
6:50 HE JUST STANDS THERE!!!!!!! are you fucking kidding me?!?!?!
Jesus this is super stressful.
Ski resort landing was ridiculous. What a dangerous moron.
Its as if sending kids to war in expensive machines is a bad idea.
none of these birds were black hawks....
And they wondered why I declined the offer to be crew chief...
Reminds me to never use a helicopter.
Most of these wrecks were preventable with proper training.
This is what happens when when motherfuckers get cocky and don't respect the power of these machines when dumbasses think they have total control and then reality punches them in their cocky fucking faces... Amateurs...
Wow some scary stuff
+Carmen Wilson   You my friend are a FUCKING MORON.
1:03 remember when that happened
stupid golden rich helicopter pilot dude dumbass moron idiot
Ok  OK   I cancel the chopper I wanted...Safer to stay on the ground...You could get killed riding in them...
Wow, that last one in the gold-colored helicopter was an absolute moron.  He had so many chances to set the thing down after he knew it wasn't going well, but no... Gotta be a hero.
Tanner you done me good
Hope you guys have a great day from a small youtuber that has a dream of 500 subs
I have a Ford mustang 2016 rt
When Tanner and Tristan were washing the car I thought of Ghost Busters👻
How tall are you
please can i a like i tried a triple front flip and the springs flung at me
Do a bunch of back flips on the ground
Tanner you need to buy one of those like 1000 dollar tramps that are at thin air that are SUPER bouncy
Who thinks tanner should buy an acon???
His brother is funny
If u use the high pressure water sprayer on the car it can ruin the car
6:00 you're welcome
Your an awesome trampolinist Tanner .
how big is your rectangle tramp
My name is changed from cool bro to the epic gamer 724
omg I'm missing out on so much cool stuff. Sorry but it's worth it because I've been hanging out with <3

A good corvette costs about $80,000
you shoukd collab with funk bros
lol I do try to slip
I like when tanner is happy 😊
They should do R8 vs Challenger
I love this one soooooo much!
I love your grandparents
fuck that without spring cover
Your grandpa was meant for that R8
"you goin to college ?"  "hell no"
Where do you buy your trampolines at
don't take car to self washever
How old are you
Where did he get his beanbags from
I like blondes too, if u know what i mean 😂
I. want. to ride. a.  gtr. the. life's. is. 1127. willis. roed
Where do you get your trampolines
7:03 guns n roses welcome to the jungle ... classic
Re-teach me how to do a caboom
what on earth does your mum do as a job to afford a house like that 😂😂
It hurt me to see that you didn't dry the car
do you know what a shirt is
Brand new super car and they totally blast it with a power washer😂
Really good video, love the hair
What happened to flips? The videos now are all about things you will/did buy now :(
You should do a taste testing video and if you don't then u have to go in the pool for 5 seconds LIKE SO TANNER COULD SEE
I have u on Snapchat
Tanner has done more videos with his boyfriend quinten than  his girlfriend paris
you are really cool
OKAY BUT WHY IS TRISTAN SO CUTE OML
Where do you buy your trampolines at.
Were's the smile 1:23
Tell Dylan and quinten there hot AF
is it only  me or does tanners hair remind you of alex feom 13 reasons why
You are a idiot
do tramp inside of pool
I like his grandfathers accent
you guys are cute just to let you know
U should do a race against tanner foxs gtr
My hair is naturally blonde 😐
It's called a cold start when u start it in the morning becase that's when the motor is the coolest when u start it so that's why it's so loud only in the mornings when it's a cold start
I like that you put memes in your videos like you used to it's pre mlg👌
What is the new trampoline called?:D
tanner you in spiyer to be like you
Welcome to the dishroom we have what you need  Soap and water thats what you need to keep your dishes clean
6:54 wtf😂😂😂😂
Race your grandpa

yea tanner do another hide and seek but dont name it the new house
Do hide and seek but then when someone is counting get in the R8 and drive away

#asktanner who's better big time rush or guns n roses (like so tanner sees)
*Tanner*: You going to college  *Tristan*: HELL NO
I bet you won't subscribe 😏😏
Congrats on the new R8
He should have left the blue pads on the trampoline - they made his trampoline known and all of his past flips that got him big
congrats  on your new audi
you and tanner Fox should race
tanner you have so many trampolines you can make a mini trampoline park
Hey guys go sub to my YouTube channel please tying to reach 50 by the end of the month

6:50 I Broke My Toe On A Spring Doing That With My Sister 😂
The videos in your new house are so good! I can't wait for pool vids ;))
tanner is trending
Your new car is beautiful!!
I'm just gonna play the role of smart ads here: Welding is not always better than bolting.
was about to like the video until i read comments saying how wrong the video was on so many points. thanks for saving me from the lies.
This is very poorly researched, understood and explained.
Congrats on your complete lack of understanding of basic engineering history and concepts.
You know what I like about this channel? How the thumbnail is actually relevant and are always featured in the video. Thanks for the vid.
So, Engeneers are not shown the faild ideas and thus redo them (leaning tower of Pisa) to name a few alredy known known proplems
Ohhh my god there is sooo mich wrong in this video.... but what else to expect from someone who says "unfun things like maths and physics" ....
Go back too school
I'm upset that I watched this
Fuck this channel is bullshit
Times like this I am particularly glad I use an adblock, so channels like this don't earn money by wasting my time.
You pronounce "L" as if it were a "W" and it irritates the fuck out of me.  Speech impediments and youtube video narration don't really mix so well.
Pelé is from três corações Minas Gerais, Santos was only the team for which he played most of his career
Your comparisons are vastly inaccurate, and thats not exactly why the bridge collapsed
...That's uh... That's not the Grand Canyon
you voice is annoying
Flagged as stupid misinformation.  Please don't watch and give this guy his $0.001 per view
How does one building collapsing destroy either all of Manhattan or 156 blocks and kill 200000 people?
your an error that could have been avoided most easily your dad just didn't where a condom
Are all these errors on purpose to generate traffic?
Humans are calculators, in fact the prior definition of calculator and computer were humans.
Be Amazed? I am amazed that you put so much work into this video and CLEARLY have no clue of what you speak.
This is the definition of bad clickbait
What the fuck is this shit? Everthing is wrong.
You need to go to school for many years to become an engineer, but you certainly don't need to in order to post a video on YouTube. Do at least SOME research before you post something like this. I mean come on!
Submarines are boats. Did you mean to say unlike SHIPS subs are designed to go under water?
This a a lot of crap. I don't mind not sticking to the accepted dogmas, but there is no need to go full fox news about it. Take that video off line, this is GARBAGE.
Those were some ugly feet.
unfun physics?! who are you even
Get this video to a negative Like-To-Dislike ratio! DO IT! JUST DO IT!
my dad cut his finger off, well doctor didint stitch him, he has a fucking shit ton of surgeries, and some duct tape
3 seconds in: "...un-fun things like maths and physics." Nope. I'll go watch a different video.
Having an English accent will only fool some people into thinking you know what your talking about young man. List videos then to have lots of mistakes in them but this one takes the cake!
This video does not have enough dislikes.
Number 9: The World Trade Center Engineers did not design the towers to have AA weaponry.
For 10 minutes I felt like a watching FLAT EARTH believer proving earth is flat using logic and science. There was no difference.
tacoma narrows collapsed because it was designed without taking into account destructive oscillations induced by wind. nothing to do with holes. it is a suspension bridge so it is inherently flexible.
this video is the biggest design error ever made.
The little kid who made this video is the one who needs to go to school.
Study? bullshit.. you need to have a natural quality about creating things.
"Designing things is hard, you must go to school for that." Thanks for the update Sherlock Holmes
It's not the Grand Canyon wtf ? That's Delicate Arch, in Arches National Park in Utah...Even THAT you managed to get wrong !! Pathetic...
The tacoma bridge is indeed an engineering failure related to the resonance of the bridge in vibration due to wind load but it's not because it lacked holes in its steel beams
Holy shit, I've never seen so many facts wrong in a single video. Did Trump and his staff give you these 'facts'?
Lots of wrong info here.
"Be Amazed" is one of the top ten biggest mistakes and content errors about engineering on Youtube.
"Be Amazed" by my inability to do accurate research!
Jesus christ, you have no idea what you're talking about.
I live in st.pete I can walk to Tropicana field
The tacoma narrows bridge failed due to dynamic resonance under wind loading causing flutter Not because "it had no holes"
Ah, you need to find a new hobby, you are terrible at engineering analysis. Hey, so am I but I'm not making videos about it.....
the construction of using 2 rods instead of one and the bridge those 2 also have to be good with weight distribution which they are not tech ed is good for only a bit of things one being stuff to do with that.
The edge of the Grand Canyon looks JUST like Delicate Arch in Utah
Half of this video is concerningly wrong...
You done fucked up.  Garbage video.  Step 1: research.  Step 2: make video.
Wow, such a lack of understanding of the underlying concepts of most of these projects.  Please don't use the explanations in this video as any sort of research for school or other academic pursuits.
This has got to be a social media experiment to see how the YouTube community reacts and jumps in to correct fake facts; (fake news).
Fun fact: For number 3 The Walt Disney Concert Hall, it was designed by architect Frank Gehry.
This video should be taken down for misinformation.
List is missing the low-budget school constructions that collapsed on countless children in Sichuan in 2008.
I'm not an architect, can someone explain what was wrong with what he said?
For goodness sake,  do your research before putting up these videos !
Why are you doing this! Its just wrong. Kabel do a fact check next time
wow... so much bullshit in 10 minutes... congrats man!
This is SO boring and corny. No WONDER so many thumbs down!
wtf is this shit?
The Comet Crashed due to Metal Fatigue due to the Square windows!!!! But saying the Square windows at high speed high, attitude blown the plane up is so wrong...
Next time tell about `Zenit Arena` in St-Petersburg, Russia. Designers and engineers were drunk when they draw and construct that stadium :)
Q: Which error do you think should have been avoided most easily? A: err..   The zero research one where you made a video on subjects you have no insight into.
Title should top 10 design errors wrongly explained by someone who doesn't have a fucking clue what he's talking about.
Two big errors done in my city: #1 Old hospital: Too small doors, architect killed himself #2 New hospital (opened this year): Water in walls, thus mold and shit floating around.  Great stuff
i sow first point and its wrong ... modern carriers can have two runways because they have catapult!
You are a fucken idiot.
intro was bad. the info was bad. your voice was not good. the memes are not dank enough. ur "facts" was just plain over-exaggerated. all in all a very bad video.
Foolishly childish and most statements factually inaccurate. Boring copy of original sources. Worthless,
some of these badmind people sick foreal.....badmind worst than obeah for real!!
Good looking people get a fight only in jamaica....but not America!!
jamaican people are some of the most fight gainst and most badmind hold down people on earth and thats comming from a jamaican!!!
should have never been ft vybz Kartel, that's the ultimate error.

This is awesome!  I saw the posts from Stu McLaren and his wife on Facebook :)))
"Savitar is totally Ronnie. Barry wouldn't kill Iris" Ha! Fucking idiots...
i havent watched up to this yet gg spoiled
since Savitar's suit is not cgi anymore, the costume kind of looks chunky and a little less cool
when savitar said he was the future flash they might of thought he said iam the future, flash, like comma flash
What if Savitar, or Future Barry, even remembers that he almost got his memories erased?
flash is so boring and predictable, always talking about family, staying together bla bla bla...its so corny. I'm actually rooting for savitar.
SHOULD NOT HAVE WATCHED THIS BEFORE EP 20 SHIT
why caitling can see savitar? somebody knows?
Guys it isnt an alternate version of Barry. It is simply Barry from the future. A time remenant or whatever wouldnt share these memories.
hahahea funny how savitar has gains when jay explaining his origin xD
Cisco cant fuck the time line so he fuck barry memories
"You can't lock up the darkness!"
I like that they failed!. Iris have been with him sinse he was a childe. and after they tok barrys memory he does not remember her. but how do he know how to talk? haha
Like Eddie sacrificed.. Will barry too sacrifice his life
Its funny when we said it was barry everyone in the comment section was abusing us, when he is revealed suddenly everyone knew it was him!! Double standard people
people should start watching Gotham flash Ia getting boring
It all happened due to the flash point journey that Barry took...can't he go back and tell himself not to take that journey!!!
Garbage like this is why I don't watch The Flash anymore 😐☹️
"Is this a dentists office?" AHAHAHA
If you want to get azar free gems click here #azargemsfreefree
So in a way reverse flash is the good guy.
He never actually ends up going full-frontal in this, so they can't truly call it The Flash, but I see where they're going with this show...
For all the people that said it was Ronnie... take a moment to wipe the salt off 😂
Jajajajajaj
Hi Cinema Lovers Please .... Don't Click This :b.hatena.ne.jp/entry/333969340/comment/jibon
this is retarded
Just a question, what would happen lets say if Future Barry literally butt fucked Barry, interesting.
Sooo i guess Barry is the fastest man alive after all
OMFG THIS IS SOME BITCH ASS BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I guess he really is the fastest man alive now.
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
LOL, I can imagine Joe getting angry at Barry and punching him. You killed my daughter and your own girlfriend. (POW!). You are no son of mine.
But if flash has lived all of it in the past, had he done it with Savitar? or no Savitar? was he killed? or did he live to come back? it is so confusing
but the one million question is why would savitar (barry)kill iris dosent he like her
Even though I knew it was going to be Barry I still felt like it was a surprise for some reason anyone else?
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. How right that phrase is, Jesus...also, loving the music during the reveal - made it so much better.
"Is this a dentist?" Best thing Barry's said all damn season tbh
Barry say" is this a dentist office"
He's like Barry from E2 😂
Wasnt really surprised to be honest........I mean everyone saw "Future Barry" like.....a season ago, so hardly shocking.   Now if it were Ronnie, or Eddie, then maaaybee I would have beeb a little surprised.
Why did Caitlin join Futur Barry ? That make no sense what so ever if she didn't trust 2017 Barry in the first place. I think Caitlyn's reaction from last week, put  away this "I am the Futur Flash" theory on the side..
This is some Harry Potter and Voldemort shit man
At least he wasnt lying when he said i'am the fastest man alive lol
Now Flash needs a Savitar skin in Injustice 2.
All of u fckers tough it was ronnie      Shut The Fck Up N*gga
Isn"t it obivous, Savitar said "I created myself". He will kill everyone that Barry loves and then turn himself into Savitar. At least that what i think
When Barry lost his memory I lmao
I love how they still manage to put in humor
Why would killer frost work with him she hates barry
Wait they erase his memories
maybe savitar was going so fast his face started to burn because of that intense  vibration hence he wears the suit to protect his body. Just a theory.
Whoever's wondering why Future Flash would kill Iris, it's actually pretty simple, Barry only became Savitar because of Iris' death. If Iris doesn't die,  this version of Barry (Savitar) can't exist
They're going to go with a goofy episode with three left? BALLSY.
Where the hell am I? is this a dentist office?!   lmao
Crazy, this season has been complete garbage but the last two episodes have been great! Hope it stays that way.
I am a future, flash -savitar
why Barry Allen from the future wants to kill Iris ? He wanna kills his girlfriend? wtf
You either die a hero or live long enough to be the villan
so Barry was Savitar this hole time
Am i the Only one whos TEAM KILLER FROST ?  Caitlin and Iris Should Go BAD ! The show would be more entertaining Than When it was 
why is the trailer so funny😂😂😂😂
julian: OH MY LORD! (voldermort) :v hahaha
I know that savitar is barry since episode 9 when he said "i am the future flash"
Definitely connected to Barry's 2056 message
anyone catch that 3 episodes left!! wft
Definitely connected to Barry's 2056 message
But i dont understand. Why should Barry kill Iris? And how did he get so fast? There are so many questions and we need to wait one week :(
Looks like Savitar Barry was done with Iris's sheet
im like 95% sure there will be some cheesy westallen scene and then barry will get his memories back -.-
This takes fucking timelines to a hole new level
this episode is gonna be my fav 😂😂❤
Savitar can't kill Barry or he dies
This episode is gonna be hilarious!
Barry is so fucked up, his memory is empty, i expect Jay Garrick And Speed Force things to help him...
I hope this Savitar arc doesn't end in the season finale and continue in the 4th season. It would be a shame to see it ending there. I think this was by far the best episode of Season 3.
Barry should kill himself like Eddie.
It was predictable when he said "I am the future Flash!" he (Savitar) keeps saying this all the time haha
my theory was correct hell yeah
HHOOOLLLYYY SHIIITTTT .It's almost like we haven't guessed since the first time savitar talked to barry through draco.
so my theory they're gona erase barry's memory so savitar will never know he was even the flash or he was a time remnate then kid flash is gona take him down so easily
16:32 McCree Batman.  Now you know why all those thugs in Gotham city look around in fear.
have u guys seen the new creepy adds
When Muselk makes a video of him entering your mind..
Oh hey look, it's Hannah! I remember playing with her some time ago!
Can you start playing serious comp matches and move away sometimes from the fucking cancer heroes
do more wildlandse
Guys Skiddle is in another Muselk video and by that I mean he or she was in another Live commentary if u watch recent ones
Hi guys I'm a small utuber if ur interested I make overwatch on ps4
What about the giveaway. Like if u wanna knowwhen is he going to announce the winners
word of advice as i am a junkrat main if your gonna die run towards the enemy. its a free kill usually
"You can't predict where I'm going since I DONT KNOW WHERE IM GOING"
That ninja mecree at 16:40😂 think he rolled past cuz I heard him say hey there
Is no one gonna comment on the pot that Blizz added due to Muselks meme strats being too OP??!
when d va calls her meck the meck can kill in critical health
Coming the raw prawn = pulling my leg. I know that from a Vlad the Drac book.
Muselk the reason the McCree disappeared is because there's a glitch where if McCree is in the radius of his flashbang when it goes off it might teleport him
cray is a much better junkrat
16:53 *He flashed me and he was just gone!* Yeh,  that happens in life
Will paladins ever come back?
16:49 "He flashed me, and he was just gone"  That's what she said.
Don't you come the raw prawn with me. = Don't you lie to me.
Skiddel was in the game and she came from the mcree video
"Don't you come the raw prawn with me" basically means either "Don't try to put one over me." or "Don't treat me like a fool.". Which both are acceptable as answers.
can you please give my channel a shoutout
Would you call it accidental if you where purposely spamming in a direction?
If only he had his alt during that intro scene.
"He flashed me and he was gone"
" Don't you become the raw prawn with me " it means don't treat me like a fool or Don't try to put one over me, it was used in world war 2 as an australian expression
I found a new sexy junk rat spot
if you sub me I will sub u all 
Dat freaking Zenyatta double take at the beginning *dies*
Oh yeah boi spam those balls at the enemy
The sexy junkrat is back!
You are one with Junkrat know Muselk
Please like this so muselk can read it. In route 66 almost at the first point if tou stand behind the huge sign it contests the cart
He uses his traps and mines wrong. You are supposed to trap health packs with them.
some piece of muselk shit play qp as hero... pls play competitive. fuck u
I would think Junkrat's mind would be cluttered - very, very cluttered :P
Is Muselk's ' key broken?
7 to 11 is 4 levels not 1. #RipMuselk
Are you going to put the jackets back on stock
No aim No brain Junkrat main
You should do try hard Tuesday for overwatch
I think Jacklz is the best junkrat main in overwatch he has a YouTube channel
record heroes of the storm for the nexus challenge. get the Dva Skin
he was using his ult wrong you have to use it farther away because junkrat is super loud when he activates it
If anyone subs to me I'll sub to you
I will make mcrees life DISAPEAR
aparently "dont you come the rawn prawn with me" means "dont try to pull one over me" or "dont treat me like a fool"....
My friend made my write  Septiplier fan fiction so I made her a write Zylelk fan fiction
honestly im a hanzo main and if i ever want to quit hanzo junkrat is definitely my new main
2:59 Spammin' out balls
At 6:00 he air shot the pharah and didn't realize it😱😱😱
If you like overwatch gameplay consider checking out my channel!
That moment when a master play says that soldiers ult can kill the riptire......
"He flashed me and then he was gone."                                               -Muselk 2017
STAHP IT! dude since your last Sym only comp video ive been dealing with spawn trapping wanna be moosetits... now Junkos will be rampart for the next 4 days... gg
Already Australian. 50% Insane. Never said he was a man. Muselk confirmed trap
wait,what? aussies have brains?!
who is watching this with no socks on?
Complains about no tanks, is playing junkrat......  Wonders why he isn't getting heals, is in middle of the rooftop......  Typical dps, no hate though Muselk I still like your videos 
dont come the raw prawn with me came from world war 2
You are one of the best junkrats if you can win a  1 v 1 with a Phara over 50% of the time
the beginning made you say your a girl, crazy, Australian, man I'm alrdy  Australian and I'm partially crazy so I'm 50% of the way their!
Wizards don't need to exist for your life to be meaningless
I main junkrat and this is the only way to play overwatch.
At 6:00 he hit a shot on pharah
I would like to friend muslek but I don't know his number
Who else noticed the Mercy from the first game was Skiddle, the mercy from his last vid as XXProReapsXX?
"Don't you come the raw prawn with me" is apparently an old WW2 era saying that basically means "don't try to cheat me out, it won't work"
I don't know if this is new or not, but I was playing junk rat and my friend was playing road hog and at the beginning of the round junk rat said to road hog "I'll hook em and you'll cook em"
You upload too much overwatch
the prawn voice line means don't treat me like a fool look it up and it makes since for junkrat too say it in
Subscribe to my channel
9:46 anyone else just see muselk just cock block the shit out of his Sombra for the health pack? loll
What happened to the discord server?
Junkrat's "Raw Prawn" voiceline translates to basically "Don't treat me like a fool" or "Don't try to put one over on me". Thanks Urban Dictionary
6:27 Muselk stalker confirmed?
Where are the junkrat mains ?  : D
surprised tyrodin isn't a pro junkrat considering he seemed to get a little to much in character lately
Muselk is the best :DSexy junkrat ftw
Now do it in Competitive and watch the Salt flow for picking Junkrat...
Ok so you explained you wants to be an insane Australian man, you said you are 100% Australian and 50% insane but what about the man part. I don't assume genders or anything. XD
Apparently the raw prawn phrase is an old WWII phrasing to pull something over anothers eyes... Weird either way
you should ask cray to tech ya how to be junkrat
When are you coming home dad?

The car is ugly and the vlog is ugly jk about the car
Fucking idiots
I'm never flying on a plane again!!
Wow, And I thought school fights were stupid. People kicking butts 34,567,283 feet in the air. 😯
this is just plane wrong
One of this guy actually works for United Airlines.
How did the guy in the red shirt get back onboard to get his ass beat?  Security is surprisingly slow.    Were they both americans?  smh
WHY NO EXPLANATION. WHO STARTED IT? WHAT'S GOING ON?
Why did the Indian man with a turban get taken off the plane       Because he was causing minor turbulence get it turban turbulence
they fight like bitches
a what happened?  why did they start fighting?
They both went to the mile high fight club
Is it that hard to record a fight the right way, like seriously just rotate your phone 90 degrees
Are planes the new fight club?
That should be "fighting each other". Seems someone fought the English language...and lost.
I really can't tell if this only happens in america, but it sure does happen more often in the "land of the free".
I was expecting to see someone hitting their self
1:03 watching league of legends
Terrible technique and how funny no one done absolute zero to Seattle this issue
0:50 is this guy playing league of legends in a plane?
Need Ozzy man on this ASAP
amazing accuracy 1:08 awesome.
0:27 What the hell did that guy in the red say? "I'll suck your pussy bitch"?
This is why I always carry a gun on the plane with me- so I can blow apart the skull of anyone who fucks with me.
Plane fights... just another trend
guys you dont understand this was all taken way out of context the guy in the black shirt was just trying to re-accommodate the other guy's nose to the other side of his face
Can all you retarded people get a grip? This video has NOTHING to do with anything racial. Now days, it's become like a cold war between blacks and whites. Like really?
They both are the ex staff members of United Airlines.
Airplanes are the new fight club.
I hope that fight attendant got a raise for this shit
Off Duty UNITED employees lol
We need hyperloops! people are losing their ability to spend long periods of time around others 😜
Got to give the guy in the red props he definitely makes a good punch bag 😂.
NOT 1 WORLDSTAR!!! WHAT!!! WHAT!!!!! W000000RLSTAR!
The dood is playing league on the plane
Anyone else noticed this was filmed vertically?
No World Star shout?
I bet everyone is gonna blame ANA for this and not the idiot passengers
Nothing new is happening in planes. Passengers have always been fighting each other, and the airlines have always treated us like crap. We, as Americans, are just whiny pussies now.
Man...I got flight in 2 days, please let it be peaceful.
fake garbage
YOOOOOOOOOOO. Are you playing league?
Some one shut that baby I want to hear that punch to the face 1:10 ran back to get knocked ☄️
THAT RED SHIRT GUY IS WEAK! BUT FEEL LIKE HE IS STARTER.THIS IS JAPANESE AIR?
The only crime I see is vertical filming.
Wheres United Airlines when you need them
My favorite part about this is the fasten seat belt sound going off while they fight *bimmmm-boummm*
Mission Impossible
Why did he cut the video?!? Dumbass camera man
Dear passangers if you see in front you will able to see a clasic air plane fight. please take your phones, make a video, and upload this to youtube.  Now everybody wants to fight in an airplane to be famous😂
The fresh smell of freedom was overwhelming to them and they went crazy.
Two men enter, these are the rules of the ThunderPlane.
That's it! I'm taking a boat from now on!
"Just give me one more shot at the laddy"  (Gets laid out like Klitchko)
Here's the trend that the media wanted to start! Acting out on planes is the new thing. Thanks to media attention of recent incidents Gotta love America
This happened on an ANA flight. So, poor service couldn't have been a factor here--and I'm impressed with the female flight attendant that physically put herself between these guys.
Its the purge
this is clearly about the tv. it's really cool
and then a baby starts crying, babies such assholes!
lol idiot in the red shirt thinks he can fight, but at 1:10 he almost got knocked out
I would fight the recorder for recording vertically
everyone wanna be on trending... smh
Lol airlines are making the news this year they have bad security and doesn't n ow how to handle there passengers
Now this is just PLANE wrong
BecUse they wanna get some big lawsuit! Haha
They were paid actors...
Nothing new here! This is how we fly in Russia 🇷🇺
I got a feeling with all the attention planes are getting there's going to be a plane reality tv show based around plane drama. Call it Mile high fight club.
I just feel bad for that baby that was crying one the plane........
rednecks on a plane
They're gonna end up crashing a plane into a building...
why? explain
My goodness. So what finally happened? Were they able to tie up the guy in the red shirt?
Bro why does the red shirt guy kind of look like Ethan from h3h3
badass fight! i would like to see these guys square off in the ring 👍🏾
Loser didn't keep on filming!!!!
Plane full of snakes 🐍 now a plane full of pusses
I bet that was United Airlines
That left at the end shocked 😳 him...
It seems that United has affected the brains of the passengers...
I guess he ain't be going to Japan
I hate when people stop recording
Can't wait when  the earth evolves and all humans disappear ,, we are doomed
Look what you have done United. Lol
I like how he tried to play victim
Nice jab at the end
This isn't even the worst part, you recording in portrait mode is.
I remember back in the 1700s no one was fighting to get o the planes. Wtf happened t society?!
This motherfucker playing league of legends and thens like "hey hey" 😂 bro you gonna do something about it or not?
im gonna get it! how much is it? i will give you 5 or 1 money if you want!

Ok. I can't  wait for whatever the Note looks like. it will be epic!
Waiting the totally screen phone impossible?
Bring back IR blaster.
Don't like back of the phone and double camera! It looks ugly!!
I agree with its design and specifications. I am waiting to buy it. Now, I have my S8+. Yes I love it like you. Thanks Samsung.
Please, Please be real! I really hope the fingerprint sensor will be built into the screen though
Thin is a Great concept but Android 8.0 is impossible
I'd pay 1000$ for this
ooh god you've missed main thing  An explosive battery also
Hopefully, this is going to be the design and we finally going get a non-edge flagship Samsung phone. That Edge design is although nice to look at, a hassle for handling and protecting the phone.
Apple 7s plus or 8 hasn't even come out yet    but the note *clearly* takes the cake here.
I'll definitely wait for note 8 rather than buying the s8
everything about this is amazing except the display size man at 6.4 i feel like a 4000 mAh battery would do any better than a G6...
WOW!!! And what music in video?
best concept it's awesome I hope that samsung make this concept in real life
I love this mobile Phone so much!  now i have the Samsung Note 4 and it is top. But soon I want the Note 8
DBS Designing, you should definitely be on Samsung phone design team because it looks jaw dropping amazing.
please let the finger print scanner be on the front
this is so stupid.  why do people do these concept shitt when it its never true.  waste of time.  btw this concept looks like shit
I wish the Samsung logo illuminates as led notifications
This is amazing! Great Work! Im a design student myself and use Keyshot for my rendering. What do you use for your renderings and animations?
Yup you hit it on the head this is exactly how it's going to look like lol.. First most accurate rumor and prediction.. Well Samsung now is easy to predict lol
This is more like a leak.So real! GJ
I still have my Note 3 and its still working like a new phone . Samsung is best
Only $999 😀
everything is owsome except the vertical dual camera
Wow. This looks like it'll be 🔥🔥🔥
Been patiently holding out for this beast...lets  hope it dosent blow up in my face
I'm still running with my note 3. and this might make me finally retire my baby who has ran like a champ for me since 2014. can't wait.
AWESOME ... 8)
Take my fucking money  I hope it has a headphone jack
What movie is this for?
why is the fingerprint sensor so small?
Does it have a Ir blaster?
I doubt it will look this prerry
I'm just going to wait for the s8 active.
I would THROW my money at Samsung in a heartbeat if the Note 8 looks like this...barring that it also has quality specs lol
now that's the note I have been waiting on for years buuut this is just a concept hopefully Samsung makes it happen
I'm going to need you to shut up and take my money if this happens.
Great design! I'd buy that in a heart beat...
Oh well, I already got the S8+ and I'm happy with it. I'll just have to wait 3-4 years until my phone becomes outdated.
Free fire extinguisher included?
it will have a 4K+ screen
wrong the fingerprint scanner is going to be built into the screen.
if samsung made this 100% identical i would buy it. And I said i would never buy another samsung product ever again after they $%^&ed me on the s7 active.
I would poop my pants if the real thing ends uo looking like this. And while I'm all full of poop, I would pre-order...Amazing work! :)
Cant wait til it becomes available. Ive vowed to keep my Note 4 until the Note 8 becomes available. BEAUTIFUL. Now, when can we expect a NOTE TABLET????
Dear. Lord. YES. THIS! Thank you sir or ma'am!
awesome job
21:00 they are having a baby

0:43 is killing me
Pepper sucks
That's not how you play bat and ball.
What makes this funnier is fisher's laugh 😂
Anthiny bennet needs to contact barkley ASAP
Shaq a hater, and happy draymond felt that way
isnt adding someone's moves to your game considered being influenced by that person... or am I trippin???
Uh, everybody was a Charles Barkley fan growing up.. His era was way before Draymond Green begin watching basketball.. But, truth be told, they're the exact same player..
Shaq is such a little bitch the nigga wanted to cry when Chuck didnt mention his name 😂😂😂😂
Barkley was never a dirty player he was though but he never kicked someone in the nuts then said it was his leg acting by itself. If he elbowed someone he said it was to wake up a guy or to scare him.
"don't talk to about shaq like that" 😂😂😂
Chuck said that Green is a better shooter...Chuck wtf?  Green can't pack your jock as a shooter.
Draymond's more like Anthony Mason with better defense & knocks down 3's.
put draymond on 1993 Phoenix Team..that team woudn't even make playoff
DRAYMOND GREEN HAS A RING CANT COMPARE APPLES ORANGES
In the words of Russell Westbrook with the facial expression....Whaaatttt!??!
Hell no he cldnt guard him..
Draymond you trash Barkley is a HOF the only reason why people know u is because u play for the warriors your a lockdown defender no badges
Charles was WAYYY better than gaymund green
The only reason Draymond Green is even in a conversation is because of Curry Thompson and Durant. Without them he is nothing.
talk like there's a mouth full of shit in there. ugly ass Draymond. woooo!
Shaq has an ego because he was one of the most dominant players of all time, when you commit that much to the game it's easy to see why it reflects so much after retirement.
Chuck would eat draymond up 😂😂💯
Charles Barkley is my hero
-Can he guard you? -C'mon man..  Just how Barkley said it
Prime Barkley? like the 76ers and early Phoenix MVP Barkley? yeah he'd shut up Donkey Green real quick
Charles Barkley was way batter than Draymond Green.
typical loud mouth nigger
In his A days Barkley was better than Green no question about that. Magic said it himself, he was the most dominant player of the dream team. Draymond would not even be on the dream team.
Love Chucks answer on "can he guard you?" If you look back at some tape, u can tell that this guy has the right to be cocky.
Shaq had me weak 😂. (Cough cough so umm you not gon add my name on that list lol)
Barkley is a former league mvp. I dont think young players give him enough respect for his accomplishments. They always bring up the no ring conversation.
Barkley was so much better
Chuck was 10x the player Draymond was for real
Iknow chuck is an hall of famer but cmon now draymond is more talented. He can do so much more and Charles wouldn't be able to stay in front of him especially on the break and off of curry's pick and roll passes
Hey Chuck😂😂😂
Please finish your sentence charles barkley... "I was talking 'bout undersized power forwards, not over sized centers".
"Come on man" nuff said
i laughed a little too much, lol. youtube "Daddy mikey - street wars" and thanke me later
chuck is the best plain and simple
donkey is overrated
I like how Chuck treated Shaq Korean Barbque Pork Meatball head ass!! "I was talking about Power Forwards" And by the way Shaq go back & watch that Rockets vs. Magic Finals..Hakeem was unguardable 🏆
When they say no disrespect but...disrespect is coming your way.
While all yall on shaq dick , he probably somewhere kicked back getting fed 🍇 .. Get a better hobby
In his prime Barkley averages 28ppg and was a beast in rebounding. And that's in the 80s, way before NBA got soft.  5x all nba first team 1x MVP  Draymond is a better shooter and defensive player and that's it.
Chuck is telling the truth, these kids are crazy if they think Gaymond Green could stop any of those legends he just named, and Shaq would make him BBQ Green chicken.
Charles Barkley revolutionize the power forward position. I get where Draymond Green coming from but he should be honored to be compared to Charles Barkley
People always sleep on what a great player Charles Barkley was.
Barkley back in the day would wreck Green.
Come on now Shaq... even I knew Chuck was referring to Power Forwards
Better shooter? Chuck would shoot 58% on the regular
"I be at home minding my own business" lmfaoooooo
Chuck would put up 40 and 20 regularly in todays NBA
Draymond's bitch ass knows damn well Charles Barkley influenced him lol.
chuck how you feel about Charles Oakley. ..gonna get you shaq and shaunie
Draymond's an asshole but he did nothing wrong here he basically said "I'm not the 2nd coming of anyone, I'm the first coming of me."
Shaq is way too insecure.  Omg.
"Don't talk about Shaq like that!" I love Chuck lols
Draymond is definitely better when it  comes to groping mens ballsacks.
Dreymond , so much better player than LeQueen , complete pkg
Barkley was a franchise player ,  Green ain't ,he's a good role player
Dudes need to show a bit more respect to Barkley and Shaq needs to stop being a little bitch.
Kenny looks very different here.
you have to pay respect to those before you....Go Chuck
Better shooter? Come on Chuck. Draymomd has a broke shot, and no post moves. Barkley dominated on the block.
@ 0:44 says he took from Barkley's game. Then says he wasn't influenced at all by Barkley.  Idiot.
chuck is a way better player than draymond
Chuck should trade mark:  "Like I said"
Why everybody on my man Chuck. Go disrespect Stephen A or Bayless
We love Shaq .. He was a great player a he is a great commentator.. unlike Chuck was bum and still a bum as commentator.. Draymond is a better player than Chucks was.. overall
Warrior fan since back in the day here. luv Draymonds game but until he wins a league mvp and carries a team on his back like Barkley did ,dray gotta show more respect.smh.....dubbs all day still
Green is not a better player than Barkley was in his prime no way also Shaq has ego because he knows that so so many players were better basketball  players as opposed to Shaq's pure physical dominance not skill.
Oh my God...Kenny worked for ESPN too?
draymond green is no where near the player that barkley was !!!!!!!!  barkley was ferocious and supremely skilled and unstoppable.    NO COMPARISON AT ALL!!!!!!!!1
Draymond is a stat padder, anyone can average 7 assists when you passing to durant, curry, klay, he plays good d so what? He is basically this generations shane battier. Chuck in his prime would drop 40 on him
Chuck in his prime would SMASH draymond
Draynuts Will NEVER be in the #HOF Let alone anything with the word ''Fame'' in it.. He needa stfu
better comparison is draymond green vs ac green
woulda been a perfect segment if shaq didn't ruin it with his 1 man bukakke show on himself p.s. baron davis's laugh is hysterical
Barkley won an mvp if green wins one we can pick up this bs theme again
best undersized PFs of all time =LARRY JOHNSON & Chuck
Join the COON train of ex NBA players who are addicted to attention. Insecure idiots! But why?
2:04 Baron Davis' Laugh is why we need Kenny the Jet Smith back as soon as possible
They cut the quote off, he said ..."Hell no. I'm the modern day Draymond Green. F*CK NO."  Why cut that part out to make him appear more civil?
This draymond "average player" green
Barkley in his prime was a beast. A superstar player.   Draymond is a very good player. But come on he isn't even in Barkley's hemisphere as a player. Terrible comparison.
C'mon man!!
draymond  would destroy Chuck
its sad that they even tried to compare some donkey to an mvp and a HOF member
Its been a year for Charles he got into it by everybody
Who is the Gary Payton lookin' dude?
Nope nope nope...
Oh beautiful creatures ......Nope

The one crook that got away with it.
She got away alright...      ...AWAY WITH CRIMES, Hillary for prison.
She was a terrible candidate period. Trump's incompetence won't ever change that
It was an competition between 'literally Hitler' and 'literally the devil'... Hitler won...
At least Clinton speaks formal english in public.
Really? all one needs to do is Google search list of Hillary Clinton's crimes and it's all there. Conspiracy theories? why haven't Hillary or her cronies come forward saying that wikileaks is lying?
Trump: ponzi scheme salesman Hillary:   Savings advocate and financial advisor   People want to get rich fast!   SAD!
Lying Traitorous old witch.  you wouldn't have even gotten the nominee if you and your flunkies at the DNC hadn't railroaded Bernie Sanders out of the Primary.  die you old pig!
There are now open air slave markets on the streets of Libya thanks to this corrupt old hag.  Thank god she lost. Now she just needs to die and the world will be 10x better off.
Bernie would've won if he would've been the candidate.
The media is the reason trump won. They tried to act like all that shade shit Hillary was doing to B sanders didn't happen.
I'm so happy Trump is President
Hillary isnt the one who got away, shes the one who needs to GO the fuck away. This women is one of the most corrupt and disgusting person to ever run.
OMG 😂😂😂 Hillary save the world.
0:34 the mnost scary laughes i witnessed in my entire life :P
Fuck Hillary and fuck Trump
Hillary PLEASE go back to the woods. Your time is over, we don't care...GO AWAY!!! You cannot beat Trump... Really?? Trump??? GO AWAY YOU SUCK!! Go AWAY! GO AWAY!! GO AWAY!!!  Did I say GO AWAY?
go back in the woods to your gingerbread house Hillary!!!
Bernie Sanders forever, he was more of an activist for human ethics than Hillary Clinton ever will be.
I'd still vote Trump and all the women in my family would too. #NeverHillary
What happened to all the email outrage?  Oh, you mean that was nothing.....oops.
UHMMMM... full sentences...it has been awhile..you are right
I would like to forget about Hillary Clinton...
This is what we  get for not yelling more about Russia's involvement  and Comey's lack of integrity.
Part of Trump's problem is he doesn't understand the difference between "strategic" goals and "tactical" goals. But then he doesn't know the difference between a dictator and a president.
Bernie the one that got away.
Well it is pretty sad you voted for some one because the way of what he said instead of the content.
She is SOOOO annoying.
This bitch needs to go away forever
Na fuck her! They were both crap.
"I take responsibility.... but it's everyone else's fault"
Smug even in her dying days. Hillary, go the fuck away. You are a liability to the Progressive movement in the Democratic party.
Imagine George W Bush is smarter than Trump.
I can't stand trump,loath him with a passion.... but what were they thinking running Hilary, such a shitty idea... turrible
not a Trump supporter by any means but she just sounds like a sore looser. like a middle schooler who got chosen last.
That was some good shade Hillary.
not a Trump supporter by any means but she just sounds like a sore looser. like a middle schooler who got chosen last.
not a Trump supporter by any meabs but she just sounds like a sore looser. like a middle schooler who got chosen last.
so hillary is going to make world peaceful just by bringing them to the table, just like that...
"There are certainly no corners "😂
And once again, Hillary doubling down on simple attacks on Trump instead offering any real policy substance that people could relate to. That's exactly why she lost to cheeto boy. 
Not getting a metaphor that George W said is so, so unbelievable. I think Trump just unintentionally elevated Bush's legacy.
An overqualified candidate.. meant to smash the glass ceiling that turns out to be bullet proof.. why did he say killton when it should be Bernie Sanders?
She was terrible, wtf?
Only computer-files laughing about this joker.
Sorry but I will take boring over bat shit crazy racist ANY DAY. I'm boring and I fucking love it.
we didn't pick him we picked Hillary. stop claiming we picked the Russian usurper
As you Can see, there are no corners there (Trump) LOOOOOOL
Thrump made George W look smart 😂
Oh Americanos. Good job on getting a laughingstock of a shitbag to be your leader. Now, we're all Tom Cruise laughing memes to youse.
Sub to my channel for no reason 😂😊
Trevor, I'm sure it feels like you're back home when it comes to this president, I'm sure :D
Trevor needs to get off Hilarys dick. She lost a sure thing and her time is past.
An overqualified candidate.. meant to smash the glass ceiling that turns out to be bullet proof.. why did he say killton when it should be Bernie Sanders?
free here gogo #gogoinstagram22
Loved the Seinfeld reference.  Give that writer a raise.
bash Trump all day. rightfully so, he is a retarded person. but DO NOT blow sunshine up that corrupt, failed, evil woman's ass.
"There's nobody out there."  Apparently there's nobody in there either Mr. President.
As a Democrat I wanted to vote for her but I did some checking and I couldn't. Trump wasn't much better. I hope next time Dems can get someone better.
Hillary for president😘
Could we equalize the volume between the show and the ad at the end?
iPhone sucks tho
Wow....just.....wow! I can't believe that Trump has managed to live to be 70.
despite her downfalls - there's no comparison whatsoever to Orange Lardass
"The reason the Oval Office is round is, there's no corners you can hide in." Can't stop laughing...
Hate trump all you want but fact is that his the president of USA and his going 2 create jobs the same way he has been doing 4  many years
All that folks disliked in Hilary was still no reason to give a man like Trump the White House. With all her wrong, she still was the most qualified person to ever run for president
Hillary is shit and so is trump you dumb fucks should have voted bernie
FRIGGIN' BRILLIANT!!!!!
who is this loser?
so the good cop says he ain the bad cop, yet all cops are bastards, they get bribed by the prison industrial apartheid slavelabour private corporate nazi economy. BOTH
There are so many triggered feminist. xD
What interests me is that at first, Hillary was all 'congratulations President' but now she is a whiny failure constantly going on about the popular vote.
Elizabeth Warren should be president she would have been amazing.
Yes, it was refreshing to hear complete sentences and with great knowledge!
Who watched the entire video if not sub to my channel
please suscribe to my chanel!!!!!
Like Messi playing in the Chinese League
Who watched the entire video?
he should be doing his F1 job first
It's weird seeing Fernando in anything that isn't an F1 car. Oh at least, one that moves.
this is all good for the 2 organization, for Indy 500 to gain fans from around the world  and for formula one to be popular in the US.
Let's say it togethe- "Team Radio..."
Hope he can win this race and then try le mans 24 hr
Indy is for amateurs.
Pls Indycar, let us see onboard camera! It was installed on rear wing of the car, if you look closely.
GP2 engine, GP2
Can't wait for the Race !
Nice to see Andretti chatting there ! Brings back memories !
The biggest race in the world he says... Ye right... I can bet over half the world has no clue about indianapolis
About 50 mins in.  Did they really forget Michael Schumacher (91 wins)?
Would LOVE to see Fernando Alonso get a Williams seat. Makes sense from both sides.
Joke of the stream (if you watched it).... GP2, GP2
Alonso is a good guy.
5:38:00 for double bird strike
What in #indy500 is missing is one more left turn....lol  #Indycar
I love the American commentary
"The world's greatest race course"? Joke.
Fernando Alonso is the best, such a great role model
Thanks for that IndyCAr! It was a privilege to follow the whole thing live. Coverage was spectacular - F1 should learn something with you guys! Cheers!
If you watched through all this you're a true fan
Test Start 1:23:46
Last video before I got to bed :)
Mclaren/Honda Should use this car in F1 instead of their F1 car
Am I the only one who thinks Mario Andretti sounds like Elmer from Crank Yankers?
It's May in Indy 🏁
All this from McLaren to avoid Alonso leave the F1 team...
I wish him all the luck in the world. This interview just tells me he is an all around real racer.
Only Alonso whi can bring F1 fans seeing this video. Look at the viewer; over 1M....
Oh... is this really one of those short oval track?
lmao poor birds.  RIP
Six hours and forty two minutes?  How many days did it take to download this?
2017 is a winning year for Spain
I insist. Don't press read more!!!     Good choice! Now subscribe! Doing a GoPro Hero 5 Black Giveaway at 10,000 Subscribers!!!
and on another note i can see him in a pit cycle being like guys whats taking so long... im used to just under a second they will seem so much longer to him like it could be quicker 😂
5:38:22 killing 2 birds with one Alonso?? they legit became liquid.....
Get ready for the Holier Than Thou F1 Prima Donnas to spoil the show.  Alonso 222.548 MPH practice lap at Indy. Big Balls ✔
49:30 forgot Schumacher!
5:10:13 Alonso swerves to miss bird.  5:37:59 Alonso hits birds. 5:38:22 slo mo replay of double bird kill
@1:35:42 Conor Daly in the house?
5:37:54 oops
Love the McLaren Orange livery. Reminds me of Lone Star JR's 1974 McLaren Offy.
born in INDY
Stupid video!
he seems so excited to drive a car that won't break down
Who here watched all of it
even though I set a youtube reminder for this test I even set an alarm on my phone for it. yeah it was a big deal :)
I guess he's given up on Mclaren-Honda. It was a great driver driving a terrible car.
Can i get feedback on my channel please ? I need help im a young 16 year old artist coming out of the struggle and just need yall to hear what i got to say.. Subscribe, Like thanks 1 love.
left turn... wait, hold on!... left turn!... watch out... left turn!....
Finally alonso can concentrate on real racing
Only use to seeing this track with Jeff Gordon winning xD
Does anyone even watch Indycar anymore?? The indy 500 sucks now...they need a button to pass??   That's freaking rediculous and that's why they have so few fans.
The first commercial had me laughing badly
Shake and bake 🤘
1,000,000 views on a livestream of a test. Unbelievable
600+ dislikes? That's 600+ Alonso haters for you.
I'm glad for Alonso, by doing this test he really killed two birds with one stone     i mean car
Fantastic video IndyCar! What a special day for us F1 fans. Biggest race in the world with the best driver from F1 will make this 101 running one race I ain't gonna miss. Kudos to McLaren.Honda.Andretti :)
Alonso has a tattoo in his neck!
How long did it take them to realize that Fernando was on track and not Marco?  Going to skip to video of Fernando testing without the dufus commentary.
5:10:13 Alonso swerves to miss bird.  5:37:59 Alonso hits birds. 5:38:22 slo mo replay of double bird kill!
over a million views within 10 hours, impressive.
It's crazy how many views this has. IndyCar has always been my favorite series
Why Alonso Your F1 Car is faster than these indy cars!
Fernando Alonso, I trully, honestly wish you have the greatest experience of your life. :)
For anyone curious, these Honda V6 engines are developed by Honda Performance Development. These are not from the same shop as the F1 hybrid engine maker.
I feel the "it's a double bird kill" will be on nascar nixon's channel
As Iberoamerican racing fan, all my support to Alonso. A superb and worthy top class driver. Well done Indy.
IndyCars sound so much better than F1 cars!    Good luck Alonso.

Thats not how you pronounce audi
#RoyalADI  1. BMW 2. Mercedes  3. Audi
1- MB 2- BMW 3- Porsche no one likes you Audi
It's pronounced ah-oo-dee not odd-ee
Do 15 things you did not know about Mercedes-Benz
1. Audi 1. Mercedes-Benz 3. BMW  That's for todays cars, for the 90s to early 2000s cars I chose  1. BMW 2. Audi 3. Mercedes-Benz
Couldn't even watch this through considering the fact you can't even pronounce Audi or Le Mans. Who so you employ to do these narrations a robot?
Royal Audi...  1. MB 2. Audi 3. BMW
for fucks sake it's pronounced  le mons, not le mans
Fact 16 competes with BMW and Mercedes for the prestige prize of Worst drivers ever. its ok i drive one to.
ROYAL AUDI . . . .
1. BMW 2. MERC 3. AUDI
1. Audi 2.BMW 3.Mercedes The only reason why Mercedes isn't number two on my list is because BMW was driven by James Bond.
Id like to know why Audi transmission goes down when the car hits up to 130 000 miles
It's pronounced Audi like "Ow-dee" not Ah-dee. Otherwise good job.
1.porshce 2.mercedes 3.bmw 4.audi porsche is always the best in germeny

You pronounce it like ou-di
1. Audi. 2. BMW. 3. MBNZ. Royal Audi.
we want ''15 things you didn't know about Alux.com''
Audi is the best Car Brand for me 😃😚
She thinks we didn't know jack shit, the video should be 15 things you PROBABLY didn't know about Audi. If you don't know how to pronounce the manufacturer name, then you need a doctor
Audi BMW Mercedes #RoyalAudi
1. Audi 2. Mercedes 3.BMW
royal audi 1. Mercedes 2. AUDI 3. BMW
please make videos for lamborghini and puma
1.BMW 2.Audi 3.Mercedes #RoyalAudi
Fact 1: this is not how to say Audi
All i know is Audi is faster then BMW and Mercedes, and it has one of the best braking system which makes it number one.
There is one thing wrong tho, Audi is out of WEC (Le mans) since the end of last year.
The fact that they pronounced audi as awdy already made me want to kill myself😭
What the fuck is that pronunciation, so triggering
#Royal Audi 1. Audi 2. BMW 3. Mercedes  I have an Audi RS4 B7 myself and absolutely love it! <3
audi mercedes bmw
So the Audi r8 is here r8?
Royal Audi 1.Mercedes  2.Audi 3.Bmw
Credibility lost after seconds with the pronunciation...
1) Audi, 2) BMW, 3) Mercedes.
royal aluxers
1) mercedes benz 2) audi or what she say "adi" 3) bmw  Royal audi
The 36th most expensive company I hear? I wonder where Boeing and Airbus stack up.
Please make a vid on merc too 😂
14:33 They JUST unveiled tail lights but the source shows January 2013...
Dats not how u pronounce Audi🙈
Disliked as soon as I heard ardi
#1 BMW #2 MERC #3 Audi #RoyalAudi
Wallpaper questions? Download Backdrops or Wallrox from the Play Store. Enjoy! :)
After consideration he also wanted to buy. The video is very informative, and well done. Thanks for your review.
Can't wait to buy this next month
thanks for comparing both different devices,,,i think that position of finger print sensor is the quite long distance......otherwise its great thanks for detailed description......
Mr. Mobile is the best among the best Tech for me. 😊
you showed the s5, the ugliest samsung flagship ever released.
what theme and wallpaper are you using ?
one drop and you break your phone ..  I guess Samsung wants to take the money they lost with the 7s  from the people by putting this easy breaking phone
I really like the way you use chalk and slate/ blackboard. Its simple, creative and looks good too ☺ 👍
Hi , i have subscribed your Channel  since a month , and dam man you make very fantastic video ,I you will cross 1 million subscriber soon . And best of luck
Michael Fisher watching you since when you are in pocketnow,your reviews are excellent, want to see the camera comparison of s8 vs lg g6 vs p10 plus.
best review on the s8 ive seen great detail.
Finally, a reviewer/YouTuber that is NOT annoying to watch or listen to.
Mr. Mobile, which one will you recommend, LG G6 or the S8?
it seems like a beautiful phone , maybe not value for money but with some awesome tech like heart rate and SP02 monitor
deep review, nice one
Those AKG headphones, are MADE by Samsung with AKG branding. Pathetic ploy..Sammy. PocketNow revealed this.
you say redemption because you get paid to
All your videos are so well put together and narrated like no other tech YouTuber out there, so immersive.. and I'm not just saying this for the contest.. Great job! :)
new front cam with auto focus ............processing speed is better than before .s8  completely looks awesome
I love the s8+..your reviews are awesome, keep up the good work
I've been looking for a really great phone to upgrade to from my Moto x pure. ( yeah it's getting pretty old. ) What is the best one you'd recommend? I'm not interested in iPhone.
Galaxy S8 looks very good...  The Screen Display is kinda smaller but its New display technology is awesome.... The Specs of this are Very Awesome...... And The shortcut is awesome too....
I like it, wish it only wasn't this expensive
Great video! Samsung made a gorgeous phone. But I think that this video shows me that there is nothing they can do to get me to switch back to android from iPhone.
you're the best
i would get the s8 if the screen didn't get scratched up and glitch out on me everyday ... (galaxy s7 edge)...
does the Samsung s8 feels good in your hands?does expensive phones feels good in your hands?
did you know that Group Play app again is working on galaxy s8? however it has some bugs but happy to have it back on my gear
nice samsung galaxy review and its really  nice tech
S8 or Pixel XL ??? Pls help Mr Fisher.
Nice video very awesome
its unique , not s8 . i was talking about the reviews with jokes . and i love it .
Your videos are so good,you helped me so much times to decide what phone to buy,your work is very good and keep on with it :)
Think I'll wait on the Note 8? With a 4,000 mAh battery?
Wow. that's a great phone. i love the video. its so detail. because you always mention every single specification.
The detail review i mean a great review.
quick charge 2.0 ??
I will wait  for the NOTE
Anyone else having the reddish screen issue? I think I'll switch back to my S7 edge
im just and try hold the S8 nah for me when u have axon 7,Htc 10 and lenovo p2 doesnt matter which phones have weakness the other phones make up for that S8...hehe
awesome review got a clarity  to go blindly with Samsung s8 appreciate ur review

Must have phone in 2017.
MrMobile[Michael Fisher] hey!!! you know what? this good video Review i need Thanks

Hey man this was so damn good....love it fam... you the best...you explained the S8 preety better than anyone else
Hit a desk corner with the phone in my pocket and shattered the back of the phone less than 10 hours after I bought it. Great phone though.
You did a really nice Review of the  S8. I think you are right with the fact that Bixbi is useless at the moment 👌. I hope we can see sone more reviews from actual Top Phones☺ Go on and keep your style💪
I bet folks are gonna be VERY forgiving on the S7 and buy tons of S8s. Looks very sharp.
Thanks for yet another great video!

Can u plz take a look at the 15 inch lenovo yoga 720, convertible with gtx1050
Dave. I'm waiting for the Microsoft Surface Laptop review.
Super overpriced. I got an Asus gl502 with a gtx 1070 8gb, 256 SSD and 1TB H.D, 16 GB ddr4, i7 6700...for $1400 due to christmas deals.
XPS 15 FTW!
This is my dream laptop. Can game and do every other thing and still look like a normal computer.
Please review the Razer Blade pro v2
Where can I find the background on the computer behind him?
Hey Dave, do you think you could review the Asus Zenbook UX330UA? It seems like a pretty good deal; it has backlit keys, fingerprint sensor, and big battery, but for less than the XPS 13 and Blade Stealth.
Still cannot find the intro music, any more info?
hi dave can you make a video about best hackintosh laptop ?
Suddenly these companies are making apple look reasonable with their pricing.
Hi Dave Lee i really like your room. Can you record the video about your house?
Can i get a laptop  with GTX 1060 and an usb type C thunderbolt port under $1500?
Plz make video on boosting utorrent download speed!!!
when i subbed to you with my other acc, you were at 20k ... 20K!!!  look at you now.......so proud xd, great content like always :DDD
Another great review champ and a cool laptop
Hi Dave,  I always check your new videos, but i would like to request if you make some laptop review with added base boot time of laptop now a days most laptop doesn't have good boot time speed.   Thanks In Advance.
Battery life one hour in gaming ......... are u serious ? its useless
thats the least pretty machine out there. from colors to design  its FUCKING UGLY  next time even bigger logos from the maker.
Still prefer the XPS 15. 😎
any chances of reviewing the lenovo legion y720?
I keep wishing for a 17inch of similar design. Thin, light, 4k screen with thin bezels and exactly this internals. Given the extra dimensions they might even be able to make it thinner or add better cooling....
Green looks kinda ugly
Please do Lenovo yoga 720 next!
Hey Mister Lee ! Seems you lost "$7".... on the top-left corner off your TV screen at 00:47... You're welcome.
anyone can provide link to the wallpaper on the monitor in the background of the video?
but is it better at spinning?
xps15 looks way more premium, $1900 is a no
i don't see it in amazon
Hey Dave Lee, I'm just curious. Have you got a cut in your pay from youtube like everyone else or has your channel remained steady because you're "family friendly"?
Dunno why but the sides remind me of the playstation 2's blades design lol
Nice review! Please do a comparison between new Gigabyte aero 15 and MSI gs63vr!
#dave can u give me one for free !?  😢😢😢
Don't see anything impressive in this thing. What am I missing?
would rather buy Razer rather than this.
Can you please do a review of yoga 720 convertible 15" vs. aero 15 vs. XPS 15"? The lines are blurring between play and content creating.
are you an artist ?  did you draw the tree man in this video ?  awesome tree man, and beauty forest
i guessing they place the webcam below the screen like Dell right? that's crazy..
Great video Dave! I love the animation at the end especially and it just keeps getting better and better. Keep up the good work!
Is it bad that it is plastic?
1080p and meant for productivity? Pass.
You know I always wonder why manufacturers don't put 1440p screens in their laptops. It's a nice upgrade from 1080p without all the power hogging and pixels of 4k.
In the video you say the panel is IPS, but in newegg they advertise it as an WVA display. Would someone care to explain this to me? Thank you in advance.
The camera was really good the mic oh god rip it out already
Why is it green ? Lol
Thank you for your awesome videos that you are making for us. Currently I'm looking for a all around laptop. After watching your video I think I found one. Thank you Dave
Another top notch review Mr. 2D. I always look forward to seeing reviews from you and those graphics you make will never cease to impress me!
Is it a 1060 or a 1060m
Do you guys think that I would be able to connect an external Graphics card thru the Thunderbolt 3 connector in the future?
I dont care about thin.  Not in my laptop, not in my phone.
this or the razerblade?
we want  lenovo yoga 720 15 review plsssssssssss
at 0:47 a little thing pops up at the top right of the screen... it says 7$
Pro tip: Put the price at the end so I watch the whole video.
Nice review. Love the details and who the target is aimed for. Keep on the great work
Hey,  Would you say it's worth it to get a laptop with a 7700HQ rather than a 6700HQ for a difference of about 350$, mainly for media and gaming and not for content creation?
Woooow dave 3d that animation was nice
Uh oh. Gigabyte is trying to eat Lenovo's lunch?
What's the key press distance?
Dear Dave..  20mm is not thin ! plastic build is not premium !
holy shit, its an amazing machine
WIth all those machines in it Dave's office is probably worth $1B right now.
So does this replace the aero 14 or coexist?
I'd still prefer the xps bc of build quality and looks. although it came buggy w feeezing until I updated drivers and now it's buggy again bc the new windows creators update someone have a fix?
The animation of the internals is really impressive! Great review as always!
I don't like these reviews that feel too much like an ad and don't seem reasonable critical/objective, though someone correct me if I'm wrong.
i dont think this can replace a dell xps 15 9560. What about those super sweet bezels and that alu body?
Hey dave how can i get a 1060 laptop for 1000 to 1100 dollars
Someday you'll be able to buy it, they sad...
I'm watching this video for the 5th time even though I won't be able to afford it T-T
The Candian accent always gets me
A tech reviewer who doesnt need to make funny faces or joke every 5 seconds to keep the viewers attention? Impossible.  Great review, seriously. Subbed for the quality, knowledge and mature style of the reviewer.
Dave can you do a side-by-side comparison video with the XPS 15 and Aero 15?
1900$ plastic laptop? i'm out    i'm out anyway cuz i'm poor af
XPS 15 is better.
Any chance you can upload your backgrounds, the ones you have in the rear screen. Absolutely love them. Already subscribed, great channel, dude!
Hey dave2d i want to play overwatch with you!!
good review but the laptop is a bit overpriced i think.
So this is a macbook killer killer
i love your video, about this gigabyte laptop i think it is a wonderful laptop but the design is worst than xps 15
green latop whith plastic build for 1.9k nice
So it's 1900 dollars. Okay so what should i watch next
I think Dell needs to take a hint and put a number pad with it's xps15 keyboards
Extensive review with immaculate vfx. Thanks!
Seems like the panel is the same as the XPS 15 1080p version. That has mild ghosting, too.
What's that blue wall paper? I need it right now 😀😀
pixar's plan: 1. release cars 3 clips 2. when released, fully focus on coco
Grey car: Don't worry, there will be tons of loot!  Comment if you get the reference
its coming out on my birthday
almost cried
Why the hell wasn't the movie rated PG? It's pretty dark compared to its predecessors
Cayde-6 as a silver car.
1:51 LIGHTNINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Hope this comes out
ill tell everything cars light losee ...now u wont watch the movie haahahahahah
#The beach ate me
who else suddenly got sad that the movies you grew up with are slowly coming to an end
And yet since it's a Pixar Movie we know he will win so don't bother going to the movie loll
Sad no more Hudson Hornet since Paul Newman passed away.
The crash didn't make any sense and also when Mcqueen flow through the air and it went to the next shot he was facing the other way.
wowww...the emotion to comeback in the race by the car, is maintained from the beginning  to the end of the trailer...
GOOD Trailer
honestly mater is the best character out of the movie.
so wait a full on race NASCAR car is not faster than a koenigsegg? I don't think I BELIEVE that xD but as always I watch it!😂
what happen to mcqueens girlfriend back in cars 1 ? i didn't see her in this trailer.. n also i can't remember seeing her in cars 2.. anybody knows?
Wait...There was a Cars 2?
Cayde-6 anyone
I hope they don't make Storm an ***hole. For once in history please make the rivals just normal characters.
i love cars cause cars is my favorite cars i love which cars i really like so cars are what i like. so except i like cars because i really do like cars okay! like if you like cars
Lighting comes before the storm.
He's probably gonna win by using his tongue, just like what he did in the first movie
They shooted Fast and Furious 9 so fast...   (pun intended)
Cars infinity - afterlife
I got a feeling that, he will not win the match.. I think he's just going to be on 2nd place, but he will be praised and stuff like that :/.
KACHOOOOWERIIII
Did Mcqueen refused to change his tires again?
pixar magic is back, lets just forget about cars 2
the best trailer than the first one
Is that nathan fillion I hear?      Rick and Morty S3 anyone?
Let's no forget, "They have vanished the human race!"
i want more trailers
My Life Got 100% More Better!
Welcome back childhood
wow that was cool
I'm 8 but I'm excited for this move!
I watch cars 1-2
Listen idc how young you kids are this is a movie for 18-20 year olds and if any of y'all think you beating me on line I'm kicking you like Justin Tucker
0:34 introducing battlefield 1
god damn i got goose bumps while watching it ...!!
Looks like I'll be pushing a bunch of toddlers out of the way to see this
this is literally the Flash season two. Lighting - Flash Storm - Zoom Flash isn't as fast as Zoom, so he had to be smarter.
i'm 20 and hyped for this movie.
so amazing trailer iam crying and laughing love you
Bullcrap, just add about 12 cylinders. You'll go faster.
My childhood is coming back to life
dafuq how could lightning Mcqueen go aiborne but insted rolling at the road
is anyone else gonna be mad if Sally isn't more than just a cameo appearance?
Cars 1 : A M A Z I N G!!!! Cars 2 : Not Good At All Cars 3 : WOW, I WANNA CHEER FOR McQUEEN IN THE AUDIENCE
Lmao they just spoiled the whole movie in this one trailer
So basically what's going to happen is this one last race Lightning's "experience" will be what gets him to win over Storm and he'll walk away with the whole, one day you'll surpass me but not today.
Why must they milk everything now addays😔
The score for this reminds me really strongly of the score from Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmarron #spooky
0:27 the king
Whoever subscribes me, AND likes this comment, will be subbed back with my *10 ACCOUNTS* Love you guys 😘
McQueen remember  speed, you are speed 1 winner,  52 losers you eat losers for breakfast
Does he buy life insurance or car insurance?
likeeeeeeeee
i can't wait to see it
Storm's chances of winning are 95.2%...Sounds familiar. McQueen wins, spoiling it now.
1:52 What is this rated!? Nc-17?!
And then....Harry Potter appears and turns into a Werewolf just before using his rasengan to eliminate Zeref.
at the end of the movie is storm gonna be a bad guy and push lightning out of the way to the finish line!!!
I can't wait for some new spicy memes
0:07 to 0:13 ok every thing is cool and all BUT WHERE THE HECK DID THE RUSTEZE GO!!?!
I hope he does the thing what he did in the first cars movie (This is my childhood)
"The beach ate me" 😂
"You'd know what I do?" "What?" "I don't know, I got nothing."😂
don't be afraid of failure be afraid of not having the chance and you got the chance  now thats a good quote
"The beach ate me"😂😂😂
She's a good girl!
That's a real nice dawg.
What an excellent dog. I hope she is still in good health!
the two favourite things in my life, dogs and mountain biking, together in one vid, amazing
Amber is a good dog

Your dog is absolutely beautiful!

The dog has better lines than I will ever have.

Thanks for fulfilling my dream of knowing what it would be like if I were a tiny man riding a dog.
Where are new videos?

Happy dog, happy home.. Happy Vizsla what could be better? Three of em and a Weimaraner and GPS running with them!
I sow this video in a gym class  :)  great video
Replace song with Trance - 009 Sound System Dreamscape

Happy New year Amber, I love your videos of your master as you catch him. I am now a member of the Vizsla  Face Book page and with luck have the friend ship of a Vizsla this year to run with me.
I must say...Amber the dog is the shit lol
Aw..you're dog is awesome :D
ita great to see how she has her own set of lines! :) . Doggy line 👍
How did you train her to go off leash? Did you ease her in to the amount of distance?
awesome... crazy dog :D
incredible mate hope to see you at swinley at some point
That's so cute 😭 we just rescued a bisenji mix and I really wish he could ride with me. He's really skiddish as of now... With time hopefully :) for now we will stick to jogs, disc golf and long walks with the leash on
Awesome dog!
I've been thinking about getting a vizsla,  does she ever get tired before you?
This is anazing.  A eog you can go bike riding with, he knows te track perfectly

That dog is a machine! knew all the shortcuts aswell.
THIS IS SO AWESOME!!! Thanks for the inspiration..... I got a Weimaraner and I will definitely try it the same way you did ;) 
What breed is the dog? She is beautiful. 
It looks like you may inspired a few other vizsla owners. i absolutely love dogs and biking.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJPQxa767tU.
00:59 that awkward moment when your trail dog scrubs better than you :P
did you have to do any special training for her to run behind you like that? my dog just wants to run under my front wheel when I ride with her...maybe im not riding fast enough :-P
Amber sure can take some corners, nice dog
Thats cool . amazing stamina that dog has wow
Best cycling companion *ever*!
I only have a cat...i think my cat will be lazy to go out biking...
This is the reason I want a Viszla now! I love mountain biking and having a dog to go with would make it even more enjoyable.
The new music isn't even close to how great the old music was. But I still love your dog!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111111111111!!!!!!!!!
You guys rock! Amber has one good set up suspension system going on there!
Nice friendship :-)
Now that is a happy Vizsla.  Thanks for sharing. 
I love it! did you use the new dog mount fro gopro?
Cool Video!!
i just have to ask.. what kind of dog is amber? I have her twin that my husband and i rescued and no one has been able to place her breed. just that shes a hound.

Amber sure can cover some ground! My vizsla Manny would love to join in. Vizslas crack me up because they are so similar in looks and temperament. Awesome dogs!
how far can she run??   she is so cute.
Quite possibly one of the coolest videos here on Youtube. Just happened to come across it on the mtbr forums.
Wish i could do this with our cats....Ahhh Who am i kiddin. I want border collie version of Amber.

What an awesome video. No bullshit. No fluff. Just shots of the Orbiter and appropriate levels of zoom in each shot of the sequence. Great upload.
Houston we have a problem. The earth is flat.  Now get the Globe model out of our schools.
Im inlove with her voice
it was cool that both the pilot and commander shared the landing even if it was a glider... :)
6:40 That's pretty loud for a glider.
The most difficult part of the mission is the landing.  Great video.
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.  VIA .. THE MARINE CORPS RECRUITING DEPOT.   SAN DIEGO. CA.  MAJOR TOM WATSON..  I SALUTE YOU. .
Of course at 5:52 she meant 6700 feet of altitude not 6700 miles!
How long was they out of space
love the roar of those turbine engines as it landed
Boy those sure sound like Jet engines to me.. hhmmmm....
Please, would somebody explain the jet engine sounds?  Thanks.
how fucking awesome is that?
It's an airplane with jet engines. It doesn't go to space. We've been sold a lie. Research it.
It's so easy to take things like this for granted.  This makes me sad to see the shuttle program end.  I also don't like seeing that a few of the recommended video links from here are space travel disasters.
I dated a guy in high school that got a job out there.  I wondered...Danny how are you.  Remember your prom night.
this guy copy right
6700 miles in altitude one minute before touchdown?  now that's impressive! Come on woman, sort your figures out!!!!
It would have been a good view if I could've seen the landing without the t.v. stations ribbon covering half of the screen and blocking the landing gear.
simply beautiful !
I got an infinite warfare ad about control freek
Thanks obama for scrapping it. hopefully trump will make Nasa great again and even better
Welcome back to flat earth 😂
Its a pitty that now we can only tell stories to our grandchildren about those incredible space crafts... :(
So they glide back to earth ? What if something goes wrong during the landing, they would lose speed and crash ?
who else thinks SSTO's are next, after reusable boosters?
this a glider?
3:58 with CC
"welcome back to earth....especially you Nicole" HOW YOU DOIN
Space trucks are pretty cool, I hope they come back.
"welcome back to Earth" xD
If it's gliding from space, then why are the rockets on maximum? It's an aircraft, not a "space ship". Did they catch bin laden the russian hacker on Mars yet?
fake, the earth is fucking flat how dare you trick us like this nasa!!!!!!!111  i saw the string holding the shuttle it was deffo pulling it towards the runway!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
coz nothing is more crazy that landing a flying brick from space with no engines ;p
Sucks how the astronauts gotta go to immigration again and fill out papers etc ... because of traveling from outer space pfff government
Stabilized approach or not? That´s insane and good.
561 dislikes..wtf? must be religious freaks & those who don't have space programs...
These guys must've saved up a ton of mileage points
you guys ever noticed that every space shuttle launch and some space shuttle landings were all covered in news channels? now its a bunch of crap!!!
lol  who is Nicole, radio man has a crush!
Freaks me out.....i couldnt go up there... Awsome landing
wat a bell end
So this is what a Glider... sounds like ladies and gentleman.... a Glider, not a Jet Powered Aircraft.
As the shuttle rolls to a complete halt, isn't it cool to think about how you are actually witnessing the vehicle scrubbing off the very last joule of kinetic energy that was used to shove it into space on launch day?
I see the flaps but *cough* spoilers *cough* reverse thrust *cough* i hope air brakes *cough* flare too high* and nice touch down considering that space shuttles drop like a rock when they land
You can't imagine how hard there training to land was
It takes an airliner 20 min to land from 35,000 ft and the Space Shuttle 6 minutes at 80,000 ft. It must drop like a rock. Says a lot about the timing it takes to touch softly and on target.
It's the hammer! Just perfect
it came from chicago and landed in atlantis so cut the crup
NOT a glider. NOT enough wing surface to support the weight. HAS jet engine onboard. NASA lies, ALWAYS....
Wtf is the http of this video
Shuttle program is very good to new pilots of nasa
sound of jet engines on a shuttle that is not meant to have any and is meant to glide in ?
People say this flew like a brick well i gotta say my Space Shuttle in KSP flies like a lead ingot if this is flying like a brick.
Awesome job flying Commander Hobaugh!
do you think of the best thing about being in love is the most important person to get out and I will not get it in a row that you can.
why do I hear the engines?
I landed the space shuttle on my computer - no big deal!
The maths involved in these missions are always mind blowing to me.....well done NASA!!!
i succeeded going back home after buying some stuff from the market at the street corner, yay!
i thought it glided back to earth but its clearly under power on its final approach and you can hear the engines spooling down on landing. what gives?
"at about 6700 miles altitude" wtf m8
Damn it became so real when he said "Welcome back to Earth"
It would be more logical and more beneficial if all the countries of the world participated in the efforts of space exploration
That is the coolest looking airplane ever...After the Concorde of course.
sunita Williams she is the brave girl
So beautiful!
Why does a 'glider" sound like a jet?
I miss when they used to use those
We all witnessed it. Gus pushed the baby and zoomed like flash to catch her. He's an super funny gator.
6:27 when u want to get in a jean that doesn't fit

I refuse to watch this - assuming your title is accurate - because I do not wish to die. I instead enjoy reasonably amusing cat videos and frequent masturbation with various soft fruits.

So you stole the intro from Clean Bandit's "Extraordinary"? Okay....
Love Ariana and cashmere Cat ❤This song is soo cool
this song is legend
This song gave me inspiration to write my own songs after a very long time of stress and blank sheets of paper. thank you queen <3
Listen closely and enjoy in Sia's soul in Ariana's voice 😍 Two vocal queens, if they did a duet i would die happy. 🙃
reminds me of extraordinary by Clean Bandit
I knew choosing Cat as my favourite on Victorious was a good idea
How she say : spell ❤😍😫
I'm pretty sure that Ariana wrote this song  maybe with sia.

ARIANA is just perfect.

Did anyone keep thinking they were getting Facebook messages through this video?
This looks and sounds like it was made by Bill Wurtz (the guy who made history of Japan)
the first 3 seconds of the song sounded like a version of One Last Time piano.
Love the colaboration of Sia Ariana and latest DJ artist Cashmere Cat
This Song is Amazing! The voice of Ariana is the best! ❤

I remember this show!
when that boy was dancing was that Ed sheeran 😟
If you want to see a funny video of a young Ed Sheeran search for: '16 Year Old Ed Sheeran stuffs his Mouth with Marshmallows '
When Edward gets his red book off Michael Winner this will be in there. One for the scrapbook. Thanks for the upload.
OKAY AMAZING VOICE ED BUT WHAAT WAS THAT DANCE😂
Stole my moves and now he's famous. Coulda been me.
Is injured?? what is that dancing
the fuck is this trending
Bet she feels a tit
0:22 tbh the woman is right I doubt the guy would have done good as a performer.
that woman is an absolute savage
thought man was river dancing
This together with the busking shows why some people are successful and others are not. He is trying ALL the time.
hahahahahahhahahahaha.... ed.... wth
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School....
I'm certain this Ed Sheehan must have an incredibly successful dance career by now
0:06 Is it just me or did you guys saw that glitch too?
wtf was that dance 😂😂😂😂😂
Ya see people? Most musicians have been pushing themselves years before they get big. I'm no fan of Sheeran but he has obviously worked really hard
We all know why we clicked... we thought he was high as shit
He was cooler then than he is now
they insulted him but look at him now
'Not even an option'. xD xD
all of a sudden this goes viral
Ed Sheeran is shit makes unbearable music that is generic
Why is this trending 😂😂
trending???
still a better dancer than me
he's so darn cute. Can't dance for diddly squat, but he can join my crew, the Toe Steppers!!!
he is wonderful
I feel so bad
Omfg I just peed myself
omg! hahahahaha i can't haha so cute that dance!!
Omgosh he is just so cute... ed marry me please??

Efron for Nightwing
when the porn parody ?
what more if Kate Upton is in this movie?
Was that Charlotte McKinney I saw in this promo??  If not she should have been given something as a love interest or lust interest at least
The Daddarios are so beautiful\...
What's Baes?
I swear Zac Efron and Chloe Moretz are twins.
Everyone in the comments talks about how beautiful Alexandra Daddario is. And it's fucking true. She's a beauty 😍
Hope he answers "Fuck your face, your boobs look better than your face!" A man can look anywhere he damn well pleases.
Even though this movie is clearly gonna be shit, a lot of people are gonna see it and it's going to make a huge amount of money
Only two reasons to watch this movie:   Boobs Booty
Reminder that the word "Bae" means Shit in Swedish
Do not read my name within 7.22 seconds.
I would rather stare at Alexandra's eyes.
What's the song used in the first 2 spots of this video?
i think kelly rohrbach is the hottest
what the music 0:15 0:16 please very much
"Not here" *Jumps constantly"* *Here* Dammit!
People are still using "bae"? The stupidity just never ends does it...
Alexandra Daddario is one of the few white women that look young than her age.... It's a rarity
Alex from Quantico!
Oh hell no, this shit aint baywatch!!!
Chandler and Joey would've been proud
but nobody looks at Alexandria's boobs only her eyes 😍😍😍
look, it's 'neighbors' on a beach
Alexandra looks the fucking hottest
Nightwing and black adam
If I meet Alexandra in real life she would say "my boobs are down here"
She jumps up and down while saying "Not here, Here." Hilarious. Shes using what she has ;) Shes like as perfect as it gets.
Alexandra and her ( . )( . ) Oh she's...oh my. I love her eyes.
i am not being sarcastic.... alexandra's eyes are really beautiful.....
0:14 till 0:21 is the best part
A collection of  money, luxury cars, abnormally hot persons, unrealistic diets in a setting of constant spring break fuck yeah
Alexandra Daddario is god's gift to mankind. how did Dwayne Johnson do two movies with her, where she was wet like 1/4 of the time, without developing a permanent boner?
Zac Efron's face is slowly turning into a perfect square
The only good trailer was the last one.
someone needs to make a GIF of that amazing jiggle
Is this chandler and joey's favorite movie of all time
Anyone manner arm alhqye man swear adapt multiple trust container visual.
bae. . . shit
Looks like shit. As in a shit ton of fun!
click bait title at it's finest...
Jason Bourne ain't got shit on me! xD
Mutha Fuckin Cadillac

Zac Effron in that dress is legit hot...... all the homo
would be nice to see  at least 1 black chick
Alexandra is so beautiful, How old is she?
I'ma Bae watchin this    No? Okay.
weird trailer.
Zac effron looked like Jennifer Aniston in that dress
every single movie that the rock came out motivate people to work out not only men...
Alexandra Daddario is a Goddess!
This looks stupid...
I was on a big nofap streak... fuck
What a pile of shit.
WISE GIRL!!!
0:57 I THOUGHT she was boxing.
Already fucking hate this movie
0:19 I really love she does that. The enthusiasm. She knows what he`s thinking.
Such a stupid ass film
Not the story  Not the script Not the comedy  BUT THE BOOBS SAYS IT ALL
Alexandra Boobs! My God! search on google "Alexandra Nude" and thank me later.
02:28 dayyum he got knocked the fuck out o.0
alexandra is the best..i wanna fuck her..
When Zac Effron dresses up as a woman I swear he looks just like Jennifer Aniston. Must be the eye make-up
I was not expecting to laugh as much as I did.
good looking movie
I think Logan Paul at 1:03
i want alexandra and james mcavoy together in a film, idk why maybe because theyre both sexy?
Baywatch unfortunately looks awful.
please help me https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RWWP8LV
Not enough thick girls
I will Bay watch the Film.... ok sry i go out
Anyone knows the song that starts at 2:00-2:08?

this movie is going to bomb in theater
suddenly the comments turns to wonder woman thread
Damn Athenas daughter is sexy af
alexadra's jiggly juggly nipples @ 0:02 :P suck'em big juicy tits.
I love how despite how full of stuff this trailer is, it never reveals any serious plot points. Just gives you the basic premise of the story. Well done
he needs to be in the pic
stampy, you need to take a photo of the motorbike and the person asking for the photo, in the same photo!!!

You could've rode the eagle
I almost pass the world 😋😜
It's a mesa! Stacy would be so proud.
I want more ZELDA!!!!!
Use face cam
The guy wants his picture WITH the motorcycle. However I don't think it was the right motorbike. Also are they going to fix the lantern too?
cool a "up"movie easter egg!
did you try the golden key you have?
I love how he wants to find one of the guys with a bandana when literally the guy asking for a picture has a bandana. 😁😂
I actually guessed that he had some kind of carrot tool!
stampy you have to tame the animals to scan them
make more stuff in the sieres
🌃Hey who turned out the lights?🌃

Give the eagle a fish
Stamps this is a good tip when there's a person and a item that person what's a pitcher of him and the item together
love how the owners pass blame...
'I really got nervous when he started eating' Yes that generally happens
I kinda felt sorry for the lady watching this.. But I hope they can make the restaurant better with his advice..
Big Boss does not approve. "This is HORRIBLE!"
Love how Pinto is the only one that have subtitles, reminds me of the news terrorist that got offended cause they have subtitles. LMAO! Didn't know it really does happened!
It angers me when people think that their food is good...RAMSEY WOULDNT FUCKING BE THERE IF THAT WERE TRUE YOU FUCKING SPAZ
Why are owners always so nervous when he eats? The food is always shit, what do they expect?
*And then I was getting very angry and mad inside myself.*
is there a full episode for this?😀
That dumbass chef should be fired. Gordon should punch hin in the face.
That dumbass chef should be fired. Gordon should punch hin in the face.
What season and episode?
pinto bean is not happy with gordon. lmfao
Gordon:are these ice cubes frozen Chef:yes Gordon:fuck me!
Your plates should be expensive not from a fucking garage sale shit
Gordon: I can't wait to taste! In His mind: Jesus help me please
How the fuck do u not know ur own restaurant doesn't serve fresh food but call Gordon Ramsey for help, the big problem here is lack of upper management being involved in the establishment 
i love how the owners always pretend to be so shocked that their chef is serving old food. Pleeeaaaaaaaassseeee
Gordon: *orders water with ice* Server: here's your water sir Gordon: Is the ice fresh? Server: No its frozen sir Gordon : Fuck me...
If the food is well above excellence then why are you nervous?? 🤔
The owner acting like he is surprised and angry, what a bullshitter.
Watch Gordon Ramsey scream at people is probably the best thing ever
His face when he was told that crepes were store bought
Why in all these is there a chef trying to undermine the head chef. relishing in the problems that occur.
Looking at all this wank food is making me hungry. I better get a baggage of crisps.
It's fuckin' RAW!
Its all about the owners they should control the quality of their food and what their stuff is doing. They are the one to blame. They dont seem to give a fuck .
witch show is better Diners Drive-ins n Dives or Kitchen Nightmares? leave a comment to me
Though I feel sorry for the owners and chefs I totally sympathise with Ramsey. Week old food? Smh
omg 34 on trending
1:34 Pinto, at the prospect of cooking for Chef Ramsay: "Am I nervous? No." For god's sake, does he even know who Gordon Ramsay is?  This is definitely going to end badly!
Everywhere he eats at on kitchen nightmares the food looks bad but i would like to see what he would say about a place where i know the food is good.
in all of these episodes the workers completely betray their original beliefs and side with gordon the moment he says anything that criticizes the restaurant
Now this is nasty as Hell
Pinto's a retard
What season was this? I thought I had seen them all.  I must know now.
The chef looks like Poncho from the 70's TV show "Chips."
What episode is this?
Tie fashion lecture century Indian city extra trick shot.
Pinto is a good name for that cook, he's about as dumb as a bean.
One of the best Twitter follows is Gordon Ramsey. Avg everyday people send him pictures of the food they made and ask him too comment and he responds in typical Ramsey flair
this restaurant was a disaster
They have some balls to serve GORDAN RAMSEY food from a week ago.
Lmao the server is legit I love him
what's the full episode?
"Is the ice cream fresh?" "No it's frozen" "Fuck me"
Wot episode be this?
Atleast gordon is right on everthing
That rice must feel ashamed of itself. I feel bad for it. Reminds me of madonna wearing leotards at 60
Anyone else think that Gordon Ramsay looks a bit like a older Simon cowell with blond hair dye
All the chefs just think that Gordon is gonna like there food and then they see what he is truly made of
When you look at a comment with a lot of likes and be like damn I should've commented that
Stop fucking use word fuck too fucking often!FUCK!
verbally kicked that chefs ass.
ok but i kinda want to try strawberry duck
im tired of eating crap of the day too. Anyone want to be my wife and cook for a loving husband?
I wonder if Gordon searches through the comments for the lamb sauce
*"The frozen Crepes are CRAP!"*  -- ok say that shit 10 times fast. haha
I wanna hangout with this nigga for a day bruh
Sound editor must've had a blast with this one
Gordon, have you been to red lobster? I love there food!
It's weird that there are no Indians in the middle. It's always smart Indians or really stupid ones. It's just a 50/50.
I AM NIIIIIINOOOOOO
I honestly thought this said "Gordon is serving looks" and I was so ready for it
Gordon Ramsay is dr Horrible 10/10
dude the waiter enjoyed that so much "I believe the crêpes are store bought"
it's a fake reality show. some things are made up. derp
What episode is this ?
That one blonde guy was so happy that the head chef was getting fried.
Who came here from JadenAnimations?
Hearing Risotto just brings me back to Hells Kitchen.
THESE MEMES ARE RAWWWWW
I love how they always cut from the owner saying they have excellent food right to Gordon saying it's shit lmao
The owner always say they didn't know that they were serving old food
I do not even keep things in my fridge past 4-5 days. It goes to the garbage!
I laughed when I saw the title and thumbnail picture, knew this was a good one.
This guy needs..... NIIIIINNNNOOOOOO!!!
How could anyone think those crepes were ok??!?!
I don't get this show... why wouldn't people just buy fresh ingredients and clean their restaurant when they know that Gordon is coming???
Why the he'll would he give Gordon Ramsey last weeks food
i want pinto gone hes such a cock.
I just bought a NINOTENDO thingy today and it was nino good1111193892
imagine gordon going to mcdonalds drive thru. and getting a burger. he would receive the burger at the drive thru and not move  and say ITS DREADFUL YOU DICK. SHUT IT DOWN
#BringBackNino
Well, at least he isn't as cocky as NINOOOOOOO
"Is this water frozen?" "Yes Gordon, it's ice..." "Fuck me"
The "What" at 6:25-6:26 is hilarious 😂
I had a ad for frozen shrimp and all I could hear in my head is ITS FUCKING FROZEN
Noob. I Serve 10 Year Old Food To My Family!!       Its Kimchi Sorry
If I wanted food from last week, i would of came last week
The blonde guy seemed happy
let gordon eat in peace why do you need to stare at him
Super video, keep it up. We look with pleasure!

Awesome video . great tv
Nah, I'm still interested in building the screen into the wall. Then it'll be completely flushed with the wall. 0 mm.
your videos are the only ones i fullscreen.
Great video! Must have been really challenging to film a television without any reflection... would love to know how did you pull that off :) Keep up the awesome work!
What is true is that I love the scenery where you make your videos and present the latest technology. What I really want to say is that I love your work and I hope you continue to do it!!
here's a great app on the state of  the battery wear https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/battery-health-your-battery-doctor/id1204398523?t
The samsung wallpaper QLED tv is better in my opinion
Heya! ! whom This vidactually looks likeprevty smaruendure
Didn't see the tv. Only the wall :(
where did u get all this money to afford one?
That tv is truly and dope and one of a kind and as always a great review from mkb
these guys gets all the cool stuff...
Wow. Great color contrast in the video. Keep doing what you're doing.
it does look a bit thinner than my tube tv
Black people have nice hair
Damn that is a thin tv
Did u say 800$ ?? that's great 😜😜
*gets a superthin state of the art 4k oled screen *tests it with a fhd game  :c
one of best introductions I ever see or listen to on youtube.keep it up!!😊
It's a shame no smoke rises when the soundbar opens. Would be super cool.
Meanwhile i still having old tv which looks like pregnant
Love your video's
Love all your videos, they are very informative and help me a lot in choosing tech stuff.
Love all your videos ,they are very informative and help me a lot in  choosing between tech stuff.
this tv make the age of tech far greater. awesome review maker😉😉
function for hidden up-speakers: dust reduction.
wow.......like it!
TV too thin for an in-depth review - LG nailed it (on the wall)
I think the function of the disappearing speakers is to keep it from getting dusty while not being used.
This tech will be amazing when the power is supplied by NFC at a distance(this ability is coming) and the rest is done via WiFi so you don't need that stupid looking cable.
Everyday your videos keep becoming better and better !One of the very few unbiased youtuber!
and here i am with my 10 year old crt 😅 great vid as always
Your videos are the most crispiest.
should have no edge tho
Do a video about the Microsoft event and the MacBook Killing New Surface Laptop i don't even watch TV anymore
Nice, but what is the sense buying that? If you have paperthin walls? :D
Marques Brownlee can i get that music at the start.
This product is really amazing  and the artistic way Marques films his videos is even way better. Keep up the amazing work!!!
Thanks for such a great review. I want one immediately, even at that insane price! 😩
Man, I know you use Red Weapon. But still Its too hard to film a tv that is this THIN & WITH NO GLARE.  Glad you did it & Looking forward to some awesome Red Footage in Future.
i Guess i have to mug same nigga to get    This TV
Awesome design, very clean and minimalist. Always love the production quality on these videos MKBHD, keep it up.
Is the intro song custom-made or...?
It's the TV we need but not the one we can buy right now, so we will wait, wait till 8k OLED's are mainstream. A long wait, A painful wait.
Awesome video as always! Keep up the good work. Love the  cinematography.
Do more gameplay on it.
burglar breaks into his house, better than a bank robbery
I only see the cable
#askmkbhd why didn't you make a video on the surface studio?
what's the intro song?
Oled is bad and poor which only last few years. You guys are c++t for not knowing. Dumbasses here in this comments.
Art on the wall looks like it was made by teyleen!
The art on the wall is by teyleen. Look him up in instagram
1:58 Jon Olsson.
Sony A1E next please!
My crt lasts longer than this tv!! 😂😂
Mario Kart looks fantastic on it 😍
This is fucking insanity
is this tv real or is an illusion
Are we ever gonna be able to keep up with technology? Slow down LG, we have small paychecks and so much free time.
Goes along perfectly with my Galaxy s8
Great video! Love the dope tech series
Damn I have to save every single check of mine for a year to afford this
Great video as always, thank you for updating us on the latest tech and unbiased reviews.
Really great,but Xiaomi has already introduced MI TV about 6 mnths before ,that comes with same concept of soundbar.
This is definitely impractical in a house with adventurous kids. Wish I could lay my hands on one of those. Really 'dope tech', nice video. great job man. 👍👍
best tech vids out there man! keep up the good work. always appreciate hard work
Wow! Awesome job on the video, that tv is the coolest thing I have seen all year, many of your shots of it made it look like a video was just pasted onto the wall!
@mkbhd Is does sound bar comes with the tv or is that sold separately.
Here's the Future and it's awesome. Life-like colors thinner than a smartphone and Sound bar with unnoticeable wire. It's a marvel from LG. Yeah heavy on the wallet though 😇
GREAT TV BUT SHIT RIBBON CABLE FOR 8 GRAND.
Just get a projector
Awesome review of this nice panel :) .  This is the kind of review that you can base a purchasing decision on.  Thanks!
Dude that is freaking great , I wish I had one on my room
Hey Marques, I really enjoyed your video! That TV looks really awesome - especially its thinness and its tiny bezels. Thanks for covering it!
Some laptop displays are $3k so 8k for one of the best TVs on the market doesn't sound bad
marq your undoubtedly the best tech YouTuber out there the effort you put into making these videos the glam shots the presentation every thing is just awesome
that Elon Musk interview tho 😍 it was amazing 😍
Now if it it fed through Bluetooth I might be impress but I'm good I rather invest $8000 that isn't going to depreciated or get stolen
Thanks for the video MKBHD..... LOVED IT!!!! KEEP MAKING SUCH VIDEOS
What brand is your bracelet??????
MKBHD I love your review of this LG 4K W TV because I want one and your reviews are very informative and entertaining so thank you
I think... i am in love :D
That's so cool how you guys get to go camping with June so cute
I have one of those chairs that Kelsey was trying to fill up
I swear to God June gets cuter everyday.I hope she grows cute like Ollie,Fin,Jackson,Calvin,MG and Brookes😊😊❤❤❤
This makes me miss your traveling vlogs!! :(
Kelsey you should die your hair the color it was when you first met Ollie
PLEASE someone, what's the name of the song in 10:10 ??? I'm dying to know xD
l love how you  guys are so free spirited
I LOVE SUPER CRISPY
juniper looks so adorable and growing so fast 😁
GREAT setup! You got your Happy back!! Fun to watch.
What a beautiful experience
Always love the music you choose.
I need to know what the song is when you guys first took off for camping.. please!!
Yay Silver falls! We live in Silverton and love having it so close! ❤
That place is so fun!!! My family took a day trip there when my baby sisters were June's age.
June is rocking that bear outfit <3 She is so adorable and you can tell that she belongs outside, in the nature :)
I'm finally caught up 😂  The waterfall is breathtaking!! Looks like a great camping day.  Love ❤️ and hugs.
Your dress is so cute!
HOORAY!!!!!!!!! This made me so incredibly happy!! The smiles on your faces just being outside! I LOVE IT, thanks for sharing.
What is that song?!
This vlog makes me heart happy <3 It brings me back to videos of the van trip that inspired me to plan more travel. I love seeing you explore the outdoors as a little family xxx
you guys Do have it figured out!!   Corbin truly looks so happy😌 being Outdoors....Keep Goin...Love yr Videos👍
I swear this quoincidence happend the moment Kelsey said raining ☔️ it began raining

What dog is Paris ?? I love him and juniper they are so cute xx love from england
Wouldn't she be to warm
My best advice to you for a warm nights sleep is buy a dense pure wool blanket and put it underneath your bedding , both yours and baby's it will keep out the damp and cold , makes a huge difference
Silver Falls!
I love how adventurous you are!     What a beautiful place to camp. Could you share the brand of your tent and shelter? :)
Watch out for those bugs that bite with that virus ..
U guys are so fun Junie is so lucky
Love this ! Footage love it !!!
That was so much fun to watch, thank you for sharing.
you should check out the latched mama clothing line! I see you pulling your shirt up and know the struggle! it must be cold to do that in Oregon! just a suggestion.
Haven't seen Kelsey that happy in a long time, we've missed that beautiful shiny smile of hers <3
i actually passed by you guys hiking back from the fall, small world!
you guys look soo content being outside and camping, that is where you guys belong, out in the wide open, not coped up in a small apartment
I really love awesome people comments! It's so perfect!
It is so cool to have experienced the same thing!
Last summer I hiked that exact trail and camped at the silver falls campground. It was beautiful!!
Love it! It's never too early to camp with kids! Camping trips with my mom are some of my fondest memories :) I enjoy watching your adventures...Where to next?
Maybe you could call your car Wendy wonder wagon since the other one had the name "wonder wagon"
I love that you're getting her out camping so soon!    There's nothing like teaching them a love of the outdoors, nature, and a respect for the land.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxS4Civphuk beautiful Waterfall Sirikot
That's a good set up you have. It's a lot of packing for 2 and a whole lot more for 3.LOL  Beautiful views too. I love June's blue eyes.
Your parents must be so proud of you two!
You guys are seriously some of the best YouTubers! Your music choices are the best! Where do ya'll find the songs? Keep on making videos, please! Blessings!
Please tell me the name of the outdoor shelter.  We are going camping and I can't find one!
Paris and Juniper rocking out the video with their first trip together. Happy trails to the Wander family!
so beautiful area
What is the name of the song you guys used around 10:10? It was really good!
I traveled with my son sense he was born and he's an amazing traveler!  Loves the adventures!!  So keep up the fun she will love it as she grows!
I recognize that table cloth....recd my FabFitFun box, great reccomendation👍what an adventure, we camped with our kiddos from babies to adult, amazing memories
Hi Wanderers, What a cute little camper. The 'Wander Wagon' is back, where to next? Be good, C.
Love ❤️ watching your guy's vlogs! I also love your camp sent up, your tent ⛺️ is amazing!😉 omg! Juniper is so adorable in that pink fuzzy thing( I'm not sure what to call it)🤔
It makes me sad to see how fake some comments are just to get onto the "awesome comment" part of the video
that was outstanding indeed    good for your family     fun to watch
Corbin's face in the thumbnail 😄
Juniper is the most precious baby ! She is so freaking adorable!  Good job Kelsey and Corbin for being such great parents. Y'all are doing such an awesome job. 💜 love from Texas 💙💙
She is so adorable in the pink sleep wear.
What would you guys do if when Juniper is old enough to express her likes and dislikes and she tells you guys she don't like traveling?
I would really like to see u go camping with Brian and Missy like this.
what a BEAUTIFUL camp ground for 'June bugs' FIRST adventure!  and all the new camping gear was awesome!  can't wait for the next one!
Beautiful waterfalls. Nature is so beautiful.  ¤
loved the video
who sings that song when they go on there hike?
I once went on a field trip there it was a over night but I missed out on the hike to the falls I was cooking with my class
i wasnt having the best day but your vlogs never fail to put a smile on my face. you're such a cute family and june is gonna have such a fun and adventure-filled childhood :)
Thanks for taking us with you camping...I haven't been camping in 20 years....I had a pink jacket like Junipers for my Julianna at that age..good for going out at night.
Every step is an adventure. I have been finding my feet forever thanks to my parents,now my children are finding there feet xx
Aww Junipers eyes are beautiful, she looks like her mummy 😍
Please, Please, Please! Why is the waterfall flowing upwards against gravity!?!? Very concerned. Very, Very, Very!
This is great, my parents took me camping for the first time around that age and continued through my childhood and i have a life long love of nature.
That is a pretty sweet set up!👍💞⛺
Love your pink bear. Back to camping has to be fun, that is where I first started watching your channel.
i NEED to know the name of that song you played !! June has grown so big and gets cuter by the day ! What a beautiful family xx
Juniper is beyond adorable!! Hope y'all slept well! Happy trails!!
awww Juniper is getting cuter everyday! it's so special and amazing to share your adventures with little June bug. x

Such a crap idea, easy idea for a movie as well.
Just when the US thought their year couldn't get any worse....
This film was shite.
Didnt this come out ages ago?
This was shit a couple years ago. And it's still shit in 2017.
This came out ages ago
This makes no sense this is on Netflix in the U.K.
I saw this movie last year!

What the hell I saw this ages ago.... What is going on
I think i'm having deja vu
Wtf is this how does it have so many views it's just an old trailer with a fake date slapped at the bottom
this movie is god awful . .and came out two years ago
It wasn't that good
This came out ages ago.
It were on Netflix tho

Wha I've watched his a year ago
Saw this like 3 years ago
Mate you clickbate fucker this is the first movie
Wtf I have this on DVD and on Netflix
Oh my, this movie looks absolutely horrendous.
Dear America,  Please don't watch this movie. We learnt the hard way.  Love from the UK xxx
To all US audiences who haven't seen this film yet or given away their hard earned money to it , just remember this has a 15% on Rotten Tomatoes
This is on Netflix? I'm confused.
What's funny about this video is that I saw the film on Netflix a year ago  
regardless of when it came out, it was fucking awful. so terrible! please don't bother
why is this in trending? this came out ages ago
I've definitely seen this before
This movie came out ages ago

I watched this on Netflix about 18 months ago
Kate Beckinsale tho. Daaaaam.
This looks absolutely amziliant
I saw this 2 years ago why is this trending?
Why would this come out for the US now they could just get it on the internet for free
I've already seen this movie way back in 2015. lol
Why is this only now coming out for the US? Hasn't it been like 3 years since it was released everywhere else?

I agree that the nfl shouldn't be tax exempt,  but you lost me when you mentioned the 1 in 5 stat. You have no  credibility when you bring up baseless statistics.
Only people that make 9 billion dollars annually should have the right to talk about this topic. Otherwise, pay your taxes folks!
Aghh the old "1 in 5 men" statistic. Odd, they never ran a poll in my town. And besides, if a man had beat up his woman, why would they admit it on a poll? Duh!
To late for that ideal their to embedded in their brand, to much money on out there to walk away.This is their ATM no way thinking NON PROFIT.. But great ideal.
fuck the NFL and all the hardcore football freaks.
Economics give me a headache
Despite popular opinion, I'm actually happy about this. You don't like it? Do something where influence almost every home in America.
Trust that only Americans could make a professional "sports" league into a "non-profit"...
I love this cunt ,  she is very smart  ! 
 I hate football because people who don't watch football have to pay for new stadiums for them to play in an only use it on Sundays and to top it of not being open for 25 years also I just hate sports
My question is: WHY SHOULD ANYONE BE MAKING 44+ MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR!?!?!?!?! Does he really need to be making THAT FREAKIN' MUCH?? It just doesn't make sense. The world is so unfair. 
Anyone else think Tara looks like the main character from Homeland?
I want to see a video about why churches are tax-exempt too.
Repeal the special status...tax 'em like they should be taxed. They can take back the Saints too.
"...why each individual congress person voted for this exact change of tax code...", pfft, i bet it wasn't a wad of cash, thats for sure!
Guess which other corporations don't pay taxes but instead gets subsidized?
"Insensitive brandings."  LOL. 
This is a bullshit video. PAY YOUR FUCKING TAXES FROM DAY ONE. Tax evading apologists.
Please make a video on Hong Kong Protests.
Please let this be him trying out new material for a stand up special. PLEASE let this be that!
I can't stop watching 😂😂
That was hilarious!!!
When he said Charles Barkley....i lost my shit. hahahaaha
Extra Blind lmao.
Why do african americans constantly have to point out that they are black? Even before watching this I knew he'd make a 'black joke'
Jimmy's fake laugh has improved.
he talks normally the way I would when I'm under a lot of pressure ...or on the shitter.
a real piece of comedy after ages.
The filthy liberal worm worships it's politicians and pedo Hollywood sewage like gods.
Is that my donkey?
ROFL....I can't stop laughing!!!
I can't belive this guy is 52 !
Chris Rock is a racist motherfucker.
Jimmy Fallon worst host ever, soo fake.
For once I can actually relate with Jimmy's laugh....not the fake shit lol
Dude has aged well. Looks like he's 25
Jimmy with the fake laughs again
Obama, chriss rock, Oprah Jay z. yep all the iluminaty black people were invited.
what does the phrase mean he said to michelle obama? "u b i"?
Why tf can't fallon keep his head up for 5 seconds before fake laughing all over the place. Are his parents on twitter? Can I ask them whats wrong with him?
All I hear is Marty from Madagascar when he speaks 😂😂😂
Well he used to be funny........
Chris any sitcom idea?
Yes mr rock famously the worst guest on Chris moyles radio show back in the day
American talk shows are shit
Wow Chris still got it damn
Chris Rock ain't right! extra blind in it!
Chris is the King
These guys really reeeeeeally miss their messiah. Maybe they can have him on for say $400,000.
What happened to this guy?!!! He's been in no films for 'bout two years!!!
Jimmy was so far up his ass I'm shocked he didn't fall out of Chris's   throat hole.
I just realized that Chris Rock is basically the black version of Gilbert Godfrey. Loud and crazy!
He made Jimmy legit laugh 😂😂😂😂
ROCK DID A 5 MINUTE SET!
obama probably will be the last black potus
Is that his stunt double? He oops kind of strange, no?
Let's all pray to god no more monkeys are allowed in the "WHITE HOUSE"
I thought Chris Rock was as dead as Jackie Chan
He was only laughing at the way you talk my dude
i like ur fake laugh jimmy
52 years old :O
fuck these guys.conan is king
Lol he makes a joke about there only being a few forgotten white people, BUT there are a lot more now.  this guy is an idiot
I love Chris rock lol
Better than the best five minutes of Louis CK's 2017 netflix special.
Does Chris Rock ever age? lol
Chris can really tell a story! HAHAHA!
Jimmy needs to tone down his fake laugh... the guy is unbearable
chris rock you never find people as dumb as you jajaja obama is really intelligent so but you are nice jajaja
Did Jimmy have to pee real bad?
woow what a nice show
James is laughing his ass OFF
crowd got quiet asf when he said slaves made the Whitehouse lol
I thought this guy was 21 for a long time
I swear this man is one of the funniest dudes alive. Everything he says has me in tears 😭😂😂😂
Damn Chris rock is finally starting to look old
Chris rock is the best
Funniest man alive
bill burr is better
so jay z a 10 year drug dealer got invited to the white house... yay we are so modern
i hate chris rock because-   Read more
Chris Rock is still pretty good. Jimmy Fallon has a phony stupid laugh, phony smile, phony gestures, and looks like a idiot king's fool. Everything is fake on this clown. Sorry.

why wasn't this one of his comedy acts???😂😂😂😂😂😒
"Who let this nigga in my house!" 😩😭😭😭💀 DEAD!
Jimmy kills it more than those black guys that run around the block after a joke
i like chris rock but it seems like he was lying through his teeth.
Why is he on the show? Does he have something new coming out soon?
he's about as funny as obama's presidency
ahahahahahaha damn Chris is a legend! i laughed the whole video
real funny guy
jimmy fallon gotta chill with his fake laugh, it ruins the story!
Sounded racist. Fallon is terrible at faking laughter.
He used to be hilarious, what happened?
"Michelle" was more interested to know if the public saw his crotch bump than anything presidential. You can bet your ass the he left Our White House with scabs on his/her knees.
Chris rock looks good for his age
Jimmy fallon needs to take lessons from chris on how to be funny
LMAOO!!! Chris Rock, this guy kills me!!!!
This guy is a fucking animal!! AHAHA

The ending rap song with James yelling reminds me of the "I'm going to suck your dick" remix songs from like 4 years ago.
Laughed my ass off (Massive Dick Cheese Rap)
"Boop boppity beep *AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH.*"
im fucking crying :'D
So there migos now Damn Ad-Libs
that was straight fire.
listen to it with your eyes closed
halp...I have depression-aleks 2k17
11:55 i'm actually in tears
with mobile games that have ads you can turn off the wifi and then restart the app and you wont get ads
you can make the game harder by saying nursery rhymes move the chicken
Alecks and Trevor look better with hats
We need a smule autorap series I laughed so hard I cried
that rap is better than aleks intro
The ads at the start of the videos are cancerous
Turn it on airplane mode for no ads
anyone else get unsubbed from cowchop because of the cancer of youtube?
full vid on rap app please
James' rap was great because of his laugh xDDD
They should have a tri tip feast since theyre in cali
AH: Better Blur those ads Cow Chop: Better Heckle These ads
Can u guys do the second app as a full video?

that auto rap was sick
This is so cute
aleks is so cute

James looks like the wolverine. If the wolverine was daddy as fuck. Fuck me daddy
1:33 Go across the, uh,... UHHHH!
3:28 now just close your eyes and comment what you see for the next 20 seconds LOL
i got punished for yelling at my phone i shouldnt of downloaded the shit game
i feel like you guys should make an entire video about the auto rap app
u should do autorap things
where could I find the extended version of their beats. it's catchy lol
"Massive dick cheese" by James, buy now on Itunes for 2,99.
James dickcheese song now on itunes for $3.99
can you imagine them playing this in their old house?the police would be called over so quickly for all the screams
There should be a rap consisting of only James laughing.
I lost it ... many times damn, only remember Alex being reversed when he was pointing the wrong way
That app at the end has to be the best and funniest app i have ever seen in my entire life
Why don't you go back to games such as like dark souls, I miss that
Chicken Tourette's
If you're waiting for James to say, "I'm gonna suck your dick," you'll be disappointed.
More cow chop gameplay of that rap app hahaha
Damn that was hilarious
New series with that rap app, please.
This got a thumbs up because CUNT.
Where has this channel been all these years? Subscribed
you guys should make an episode of just the rapping app
12:03 when you get down on a sick beat
That game gets more ads than YouTube
the ending needs its own series. can you put james rap on itunes, so i can blast it, driving through town on repeat
can anyone tell me that track that Aleksandr was listening too at the end of the video when he was eating
Please play more of this app im crying 😂😂😂😂
came for chicken scream stayed for auto rap
this was the best
Id watch a part two
"I won't see it 'til I believe it"  -Joe 2016

@9:35  Someone screen cap James' face
Mobile strike is the most cancerous thing on moblie

Ahaha this is so funny, James casualy talking and Aleks looks like he has Tourette's syndrome and keeps cursing :P 2:47
Can we pleeeeaaaaasssseeee have a full episode of the Autorap thingy?
Put them songs on iTunes!!
You should do you're update videos playing this game so you have something to talk about and just have someone scream to jump
i was in school watchin this, losing my shit. Everybody be lookin, akward af
I love how the best part of their Chicken Scream gameplay was them fucking around with a different app.
Who got the ad wit the fucking ice swan bong? Shit was majestic and soothing af 😂
This was already such a great and funny video, it's almost as if Chicken Scream was made for these two. But then, we get AutoRap. Please do a whole video messing around with AutoRap! :D
who else was watching this stoned dude i laughed my ass off XD that rap XD
You should've played this game when Trevor was getting his hair done. He screamed quite a few times.
I would love to have playable ads during TV commercial breaks. Too bad they use them to interrupt shit.
Can we have a single video dedicated to that rap app please?
11:52 HES SO FUCKING HOT OI PAPI
do a vid with the rap app, shit had me dyin
Hey Aleckxs why don't you try to get a new intro using that rap app. Would be much better than the gay shit you have on your channel now.
Can u read 50  shades of grey while playing this game?
i am fucking crying right now the fucking 50 cent i can't i had to pause that shit my eyes are crying
turn of the wifi of your phone and the adds will be gone
Holy shit I just got an ad on a video. That's the first one in like a month. I was so excited I actually watched the entire thing.
I've got an sudden urge to use Uber Eats, don't know why.
Make sure after you finished watching one of there vids u smash that like button no joke
Russian Dyke and Colonial Plantation Owner play Tourettes: The Game
please make a full video on the rap app
that flame explains the sun
All that's missing in this video is a cat :-) 
Brucs lokks like a kid with his balloons xD
I always find amusing when atheists call for their god! :D @0:06
Hello from France 🇫🇷 And hello from the subscribers of e-penser ;)
how much does that cost?
they should have gotten a fidget spinner and spun it in there
Sounds like a porno in the beginning
So basically my mixtape in space
Guy with VR set at 5:17, like 0G is not enought for him
the guy doing the iron man move at 3:19 was awesome
Who is the girl at 1:53?
Did it feel like falling the entire time? Or at least at the beginning?
How much is a ticket?
The problem with your lighter (as you already mentioned) is that the fuel is pressurized, if you redo this experiment use a Zippo lighter.
"it feels like someone's laying on me, *and I like that*"
Can someone tell me where you can go and do this?!?!?
Am I the only one here who thinks Derek and Diana look good together and should be together?
You should have put the footage where you kicked Bruce in the balls.
5:10 Havin' fun back there with your VR headset?
oh, it costs only 6000 euros! i'm gonna give up eating and i'm gonna do it!
Now we need Zero-G VR ;)
Working on that plane must be the coolest Job in the World!
Trump voters dont believe in science, they probably think gravity is demonic forces instead
I feel like this really explained zero g more for me. But damn, I can't help but to think how dangerous it is
0:20 look at the girl on the left  this is so freaky, she's like the possessed girl in Harry Potter  °-°
brother capital G cannot be zero it is 6.6x10^-11
No such thing as a vacuum man, nor does oxygen get "pulled" in
again, no its not zero g, its mistake wich most of ppl say.
you get to do cool things
Confirmed Derek is funded by Big Weight.
Why didn't you guys bring a candle? BBQ lighter has that stream of gas coming out. Would've been cooler if you replicated what they did in space.
all flying aircrafts can poduce the 0g effect (= you might just not want to do it in some aircrafts though hehehe
the video is 7:47 long  funny easter egg
contrast is what you feel not zero G (micro G) Scuba diver. can do the same with a thicker zero G - it's called neutral G.
Gravity is while European small dude's creation to award male supremacy.
wtf ... 29s in I thought the plan crashed .. jeez ..
4:46 he was so excited about the flame he started climbing the walls! hahahaha
But when you throw a slinky on earth it also experiences 0G but just don't stay in the air as long (obviously). that was a waste of a 22 seconds.
I love how people keep recycling the same old videos that have been done over 2 decades ago and act like this is something new. NEXT PLEASE.
"It feels like someone lying on you... and I like that"  oh... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
This is so awesome!
I hadn't realized before.  My lighter has a gravity control.
Movement while under Martian gravity was the most interesting part for me to watch, as I already know how zero-G looks like thanks to videos from ISS. Now I want go to Mars 10x more than before!
I just really wanna play vr games in a vomit-comet
It is a creation of evil men
Who's the hot girl at 2:00 ?
Gravity dont exist
I'm adding a flame to any sci-fi now because of this! :D
This is crazy lol. Mad dope to like my channel haha
you really work hard on your content to make it unique and interesting. thank you
O MY GOD! I'm watching ep 1 of bill nye saves the world and I'm LOSING IT because you were just standing there and I was just like I KNOW THAT GUY this is gonna be awesome!!
Don't impose your gravity on me...  ...this is Scientific appropriation
Who let him take a lighter on the plane??
should've took a fidget spinner up there
1:35 Vegeta would be so disappointed in you :)
Science is awesome.
the slinky video was one of the first veritasium videos I ever watched, maybe even the first.
At first I thought the channel name was a Harry Potter reference :P
I saw e-penser !!!
2:57 "Pen inside experiences weightlessness from the time it leaves my hand until it comes in to contact again"......But when the bottle is moving upwards shouldn't the pen weigh more???
I don't understand why slinky does not contract after he let go. Can anyone explain in layman's words?
"Plane and you are still moving upwards but you are accelerating downward..... "  what???
"and I like that"... You sly dog hahah
I wish my bank account had 1.8g
Thought it said fight in zero G
Bottle flip in ZERO-G
WAS IT A CAR OR A CAT I SAW <----------------read backwards
1:54 Why are two of his teeth whiter than the rest?
This video, like all of yours, was really great
what is man
idk what happened, but there's a lot of triggered christians in the comments.
new scientific breakthrough there are millions of genders!
Cant experience zero-G if the plane cant pull up in  time...
Must be funny to be the pilot and controlling the plane at zero g!
This is so cool.
1:28, what the heck is coming out of your mouth?
Simulated 'zero-G'
wouldnt monkeys be better suited for zero g since they have 4 hands
i was expecting someone to drop a fire mixtape in space but instead i learned about zero gravity
It makes most people barf.
do you believe in gravity?
Is the Zero G plane available for common citizens too?? Or only scientists??
How they all act like there where 6 years old.
ME DA GEMAS SUPERCELL
More like a small loan of a million dollars!

Is Kris (biologically) a boy or a girl? No hate I just don't know
Non-Christian, but this video really is moving and well done. This country deserves better. Glad to see there are still mass congregations dedicated to a positive cause, wanting the real South Africa back.
I couldn't help notice that Buchan prayed against sex before marriage  and everyone said "amen". I guess there were at least a few crossed fingers ..... ha ha!
Was a special day indeed, thanks for sharing
Wow Wow!! What a wonderful video! Great stuff and all glory to GOD Jesus Christ is Lord of all!
most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.prayer ...if these ppl voted right the ANC could have been voted out but noooooo!!!!
A M E N !!! God is so so good..
Makes me sick! 2,000,000 hands folded in prayer still can't achieve what 2 hands and a shovel can.
when we say we thank the Lord,we must say we thank the Lord ,Jesus Christ.because others might mean other Lord or God.
this makes me cry.... wonderful
that ending.. epic footage!!
this is the best video ive seen.. great job
God is so good
What a Mighty God we serve!!!!
Great video! Goosebumps and tears all over again!
Amazing video! Well done!
From Cape to Cairo!!!!!!
All Africans for Christ including whole world One God One Nation united in Christ for the Glory of God only !!!!!!!!
Well done, just great work! Subscribed...
WOW NICE VIDEO!
This is how South Africa's Christians do church, not black, not white, not Indian, I am a South African.
What a beautiful video Wayne! All praise to Jesus Christ our Saviour. You have such a talent and are using it for HIS glory.
Thank you so much for this awesome clip! I wasn't able to attend but after watching this I felt like I was there.  It brought me to tears!
Glory to God !
dit was amazing!!!! Glory to God
Namibia stand together with SA in prayer, God will heal SA, Namibia and Africa!!!

I have a question..   should I upgrade from an iPhone 6s+ to an S8+??

Can u change the bixpy button for something else

Love it getting one fo  sure
S8 Plus or Iphone 7plus. I have had samsung for as long as I can remember. What should I do?
I would let someone stab me with that knife
One of the best unboxing videos of S8! Great video! But the best in this video is your cat :D
I just got the s8 in all black 2 days ago and that thing is sweet.
Love the phone,but didn't have all language. I could have bought iPhone instead. galaxy has every language but Khmer I wish they could done better.
Are you from Rochester? Garcia fam in the line?
You are like some chicago gangster. Telling, selling. Carry on.
Galaxy Fireball 7 LMFAO!!!
I like you hating price Samsung G8. I have one. Have always though loved LG. Too late though stuck with fam plan galaxy s8-pretty cool! :-)
the cat is more hyped about the S8 than the guy
Brilliant Design Lovely!!
"i got to make a smell test "😂😂😂😂😂

i will spend the money for the galaxy s8's
Hey Floss, what is that dope watch you showed you got with your G6?
Sheeet they worth it because i have a note 3 and that bish was like 735 2 yrs ago (t mobile payment plan) so these are worth it!
how much for the cat?
The cat made me feel so uncomfortable!! 😐😐
They are almost about the same size
You drop the phone in whole video...you can't handle it or you are just idiot ?
Does it come with the flame on app , like the last one ? That app was a real killer app !    What ? ....... to soon 🙃
hey..your cat is cute !!# lol
my mom got the s8 and I got the s8 plus. there a big difference  for me I LOVE THE S8 PLUS
#NuggetGate
Hi Flossy, great video as always, really appreciate how u always talk about the bad things of any product. Most YT only tell u how great and awesome everything is and not what the phones are really lacking :)
You're videos are informative, entertaining and hilarious all at the same time! Thanks and keep up this perfect formula! Zurgs is killing me haha!
@flossy Carter I was having problems with split screen not being able to watch YouTube& text at same time
Floss does older generation Samsung wireless charger work with the S8? I have read reports on Ars Technica and Phandroid that they don't....Can you verify this Bruh?
The cat is like them phones are my mine boi.

Biggest spoiler I have seen in a trailer for a VERY long time.
sooo.. wheres the pug? 😂
*shows that Harry is still alive* This is not how to do a trailer
the music and this trailer,  so good to put them together  really want to see the movie immediately!!
The whole trailer feels like...(at least the visual aspects) a selfie that has been photoshoped too much @_@
Not much promising, but I love the casting of Julianna Moore!!!! -The Governor
U know the first one is my fav movie so seeing this looking good still has me pumped
James Bond jr
Looks like they reassigned Javier Pena to England after his spell in Colombia.
Kingsman: The Golden Circle | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX
Kingsman: The Golden Circle | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX
That man is adorable!!
When the trailer that has been up over a  week has more views than the first trailer 2 years ago!
Love the British Style!
Omg it's so guud.

WHY IS HE SO HOT?!
Cowboy themed spies - I'm so done! XD
I'm deadass watching this
does anyone know who that song is by???
It surprised me how awesome the first one was. So glad there's a second. Mark Strong is the man.
I liked the first one so I hope this one is good
looks great
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
YEP definitely going to watching Eggsy, doing his stuff.. WOW The Kingsmen are back Woo hoo :D
They should do a prequel of how harry became a kingsman
The first one was really enjoyable and a great film for entertainment
This will be the next Bond franchise
The last one was so FREAKING good, I hope this one is just as good.
Is that Charlie puth?
Jeff Bridges!
The song reminds me of mike from sing hahahah😂😂😂
this is better than 007
This is gonna be amazing.
I've watched this trailer like 20 times now
Omg ....... so many butterflies, am I the only one that noticed that?
He's alive!
Can't wait!
Im so ready for this!
We all had a moment at 1:30
Goddamn I've been waiting for this for more than a year now, I really hope they don't make the sequel garbage and I hope it's gonna be as awesome if not better than the First.
https://wn.nr/hSrCCL  <<< MASSIVE GIVEAWAY
fail realize competitive chronic indication mate dream frustration.
OMG harry comes back to life yassssssssssssss
i wonder how many penta kills i will se. hmmmmm.
hol up, channing Tatum as a cowboy spy? hell yeah
Mark Strong's delivery of that line "Oh god... Harry." Gave me goose bumps.
Kingsman: The Golden Circle | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX
When the trailer ruins one of the movies twists
I wonder if harry will be the bad guy because nothing says evil like a eyepatch.
integrity looks for me  pretty  brilqiant# profound  :-))
Harry got shot in the head in the last movie, now he comes back with an eye patch. *ok* *then*
McCree it's not high noon...
I don't know why but I can't stop watching this trailer...maybe it's the combination of Kingsman and Frank Sinatra.. and I love it!
Cade os Br's aqui?
I can't wait for this movie ^_^
I NEED To see this
cant wait to see this 😊
the main reason im excited for this is channing tatum he is so awesome in every movie hes in
So the girl not in this one.
Feel bad for color blind people who just saw dots
wait, wait, nobody has even understood. HARRY IS ALIVEEEE
That looks mint 👌
I wonder why they gave Julianne Moore top billing????
And you wonder why Trump won? This is your answer.
dude had one gun. and don't know how to shoot it. just wondering how many innocent people got hurt by morning. they call us monkeys and that's what they look like.
A lot of STDs was passed around that day
what type of camera you use to film with
never been to freak nick I'm going to something it look Hella live out there
biloxi sure fucking changed since i last lived there back in 99 , used to be very layed back but now its full of this bullshit....
I went to black beach without going to black beach😁Shout to homie who recorded all this! Good look homie! Keep doing ya thing!! Va C u..💯
man like i side let people have fun fuck that shit niggas away hating on other blacks more than white people young people just doin they thing like anybody else when you young
4:47 that's me coming dine 903 TEXAS SHIT
I love it ! (:
Very nice camera work. Enjoyed the footage. Question: Where is the drone footage from the Phantom 3? Keep up the good work. I will subscribe to your channel. Thanks for posting.
9:49was the best
I didn't understand a thing anyone was saying!
This shit sad, beautiful, ratchet, lovely, contagious, remedial and felonious; all at the same damn time.
let,em have  fun.  Niggas  need 2 stop  the  hate. latinos Do the  same  shit  for calle 8..in miami or the cinco De  mayo..party they  do this  shit  all weekend.....stop the hate  niggas
white people dressed and act the same way flashing their titties on spring break fucking on the beach getting fuck up and fighting Elise  no one is fighting
Can't even enjoy a fucking video without seeing racist comments from these Neanderthals.
black folks
man i loved every minute of it...  im from North Carolina.... Can anyone  tell me what dates  this bike week happens...
just people happy living life having fun dont understand all the haters who cares bout all the money spent you did'nt earn it!!
My question is did they ever get to the beach? When I go to Biloxi, I always go to the beach. And it's at least 5 hours before I get back in the car and move. These fools look like they spent money on gasoline only.
where they get all that money for those nice exensive cars ,they cost a,lot of $$$$$?
man WTF as soon as the shyt start 0:55 sec THIS BIG ASS BITCH WENT TO POPPING THAT PUSSY & HER WHOLE TAMPON STRING FLEW OUT... OLLL BIG NASTY FISH STICK SMELLING ASS BIH (0:55 SEC)
man I miss these days when I was out there like this
Two things I know....I never seen blacks trolling white pages and I never see whites talk about their own race like blacks talk about theirs....u some fuckin buck dancing coons black crackkka ass Negroes...
This some some country ass shit but it look like a interesting experience. lol
just because I'm white doesn't mean i have to say racist things but this twerking shit i find it nasty when my 8 yr old neighbor kid does it
I never seen so many tampon strings in my life 😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜
we are a lost people.....when they get old they will tell their young ones not to do what they did.... trying to recreate the kappa...before the end  try to bring back child hood memories and die with a smile
I went last year and wasn't impressed.  Shit like this happens every Sunday in New Orleans, and the cars and the women look a whole lot better!
Maurice Lucas+ couldn't agree with u more.But unfortunately bro...that's all wishful thinking..certain types of blacks could never reach that level of thinking...and that's due to generations lost
Glad these young folks had a GOOD TIME! They not out here killing or robbing anybody.... LUV IT
Low Class Niggas.  This is the grease from the bottom of the crud barrel that makes the Black American look like got damn Animals!!   The laughing stock and the pit of every joke on the planet!
MOST IGNANT SHIT I EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.
AND IN THE ETERNAL WORDS OF ADOLF CAESAR; "AND IF IT WASNT FOR YOU SOUTHERN NIGGAZ, WHITE PPL WOULNT THINK WE WAS ALL FOOLS."...FUKN COUNTRY AZZ BAMMA CLOWNS.
typical black women
why the dumb bitches with the flattest asses always the ones twerking, attention whores
Hoodrats galore. Mostly fat ugly hoodrats too. No thanks!!!
We had a great time down there even though I was at the casino the majority of the time. I'll be in Savannah GA this weekend though Orange Crush!!
damn I gotta start selling drugs too
Neva heard of this
Niggas pulled up in a pimped out school bus lmao
Chimpout 2017, animal control must have been busy rounding up some pavement apes down there. Not a single nigger in the sand haha. Miserable sub human spooks I wish aids would hurry up and kill your retarded asses.
y'all jokers must be crazy!!
To all my black folks Every other race thinks we're BROKE TAKE THAT BS POLICY AWAY FROM BANKS CHARGING US MORE IN INTEREST AND BUSINESS LOANS AND WATCH US PROSPER like no other.
a t l aint shit just bunch of downlows...lol
For the culture
Good shit man
Nice to see and stop the HATE.
They should have an interpreter for this video. So we can here it in English.
It's nice to blacks out having fun instead of shooting each other. I can't wait to see white beach.
well at least it's more organized than the 1st black beach was.

Elk is darkeyes. Elk is Cherokeeees tell them johnny. Blueyes are pig thieves. 
saw him last week actually, in New York. tussled his hair and made a little joke of it - was pretty funny. It didn't even wake him up! I licked behind his ear, and it was gross. Got the hell outta there quickly tho
He actually does this for fun
Disney World sucks. It's old. It's dirty. Lots of things don't work. No characters are walking around. Go to Universal. The difference is like night and day.
wow thats one advanced walking animatronic right there
He is awesome
i dont think its true ... there is no wine around
this is magical
he needs money because that bitch took everything and now shes with elon musk.
I was at disney this weekend WHAT
I actually saw him when I went to disneyland
A well done animatronic, really lifelike. What people cannot create these days.
Can't believe ppl on the boats kept their shit together and didn't jump off the boat to reach Jonnhy omg
what a fuckin legend
I feel heartbroken , as in literally 💔.
I would have just thought "this is a really good lookalike"
WHY COULDN'T I HAVE BEEN THERE I'M SOBBING
Loey Lane where are you?
How dare you not include "Captain Jack Sparrow" in the title
i should have been there when i had the chance. Johnny Depp on my camera would have gained me more subs on my channel. But i cannot make it back to Disneyland until December this year
Who else was at DECA ICDC during this??
I would've jumped into the water and ruined this experience for everyone
I would have fucking dived into that water as soon as he said "Jump out into the water".
lol awesome
Story breaks of Depp being $40m in debt. Now he's working at Disney? Uh oh...
I was on that ride at Disneyland years ago that was fun.
Johnny Depp and Emir Kusturica are old friends. Kusturica said that Johnny is a normal person, and not some snob, like the rest of the actors.
I would legit jumped off the boat to get a pic with him
stop hanging with Marilyn Manson Johnny
i think the Jonny Depp in here is real, the ones in movies are just fakes
Captain! CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow!
Funny.  I said this a couple of months ago when I was on this ride in Orlando. That Depp appearing here in costume would be a great promo for the film.  And they did it.  nice!
my grandma would jump out of the boat and Legit freaking Get so many autos
I would've been like, damn...first that creepy avatar animatronic, now this. They are getting good.
This is a sign of the end times.  The next horseman is frozen Walt Disney rising from his slumber.  Do not ignore the signs!
Me and my mom went to Disneyland at the wrong time again. We went two weeks before this.
Plot twist: that is not johnny depp but actually a new animatronic they added to the ride.
Ya I would have jumped out the boat
I wonder if he just does this on his days off now.
Always good to see celebs that surprise fans in good ways.
dont care if hes a douche bag if hes able to make us smile with his great acting... than hes still the best.
When you live in Florida ;-;
I wonder if Depp was even supposed to be there and just drunkenly wandered in off the street.
you gotta be Johnny Depp to afford to get into Disney.
The only reason to bring booze and go to Disney....
Noah fence but this is the best thing to happen in 2017 so far
I would jump out and give him a hug! He's my favorite person ever!!!
reeks of desperation.  he should dressed up like a native American with a dead bird on his head. I haven't forgotten!
"JOHNNY DEPP OMG HAHAHA"
But that man looks drunk and psychotic. I guess it really is Johnny!
Another reason why this is my favorite Disney ride 😍
My favorite ride in the whole park
Wtf!! Everytime I go to Disneyland nothing like this happens!
Captain Jack Sparrow is drunk again
i would actually jump into the water and give him my boat HAHA
Johnny Depp's the best. That would have been awesome to see!
Damn! After all these years... Captain Jack Sparrow hasn't aged a bit! I guess finding the fountain of youth did actually pay off.
Drowning in pussy...
whoooooaaa thats awesome !! how lucky
I remember smoking Blunts in the bathroom at Disney Land, and being high as fuck for my first time on the ride.
*ahem*  *Captain* Jack Sparrow.
So I guess the new agent is working  out eh??
I literally was there last week UGH
Fuck that bitch Amber. Youre a much better person than her Johnny. Shes just a thot.
That's Fucking Awesome.
That should be his new job....idiot.
I would be that one dork who'd be all, "The animatronics look so real!"
Wow those animatronics are getting really realistic...
I'd be the idiot who didn't notice that was really him
You spent his name wrong it's *CAPTAIN* Jack Sparrow
Who films a ride? Can we do nothing anymore without recording it?
legend has it Johnny Depp is still on that ride to this day
people, record *horizontally!!*
This is some legitimately crazy stuff, here. This is like going into Haunted Mansion and seeing Eddie Murphy....  I hope that video is on Youtube, soon.
I would've flipped absolute shit
women abuser would never do such a nice things like johnny does , fucktards.
Depp is so fantastic in that role, first time seeing the movie was on a Disney Cruise ship, it was a great night!
I would of jumped out of that boat
When I saw the title I started crying because when I went on the ride it looked so much like him and I wanted that to happen idk why im crying im just sad I wasn't there to see that lmao
MAGIC IS REAL; DISNEY IS FAKE.
That's awesome
The video in a sentence: Jonny Depp OMG
I would dead ass shit my pants
What did we do to deserve Johnny Depp
Johnny needs money lol
Yo all these indians on the come up rn. Aziz Ansari, Riz Ahmed, Hasan Minhaj, me, etc. Feels good man.
I really liked the original. What was it called? Oh yeah...Masters of None.
wow bo burnham isnt even IN the trailer. Which is the only reason why anyone would watch it.
hahahaaa, I actually was expecting the x files related tourette burst-out somewhere :)
I saw Bo Burnham! 2:22
Kumail Best of luck man, looking forward to watch this movie.
The people I know who should watch this probably won't.
Oh look! Some more degenerate race mixing propaganda from Hollywood!   Dailystormer.com
dislike, that sand nigga. not gonna watch it
This looks great.
What's up Bo
What could be the twist of this movie I feel like they told me everything watching the trailer made me less likely to see this movie
You can't act Kunal. Go back to what you were doing. I could not sit through the trailer even. Go back & find some expressions man.
Am i the only one that finds Kumail unfunny?
More degenerate racemixing propaganda from (((Hollywood)))  visit www.dailystormer.com
Why is Hollywood pushing so many disgusting street shitters in media all of a sudden?
Thought this was just going to be more social justice crap. Instead I find out its just a realistic example of two people who want to put each other ahead of the cultural stigmas they were born into.
The left likes it because it's about minorities. The right likes it because it's not demonizing white people.
I'll wait for this to be a rental definitely not worth seeing in the theater
Who else is here for bo?
I was looking all over the deep dark web for this yesterday!!!!
who else here came for Holly Hunter?
it's basically what happens after she goes into coma. kinda reminds me of "while you were sleeping " starring Sandra Bullock
Thanks for making me wait so long to see the name of this garbage movie. Just your typical lefty propaganda bullshit. I've got a better name for it though. I'd call it "The curry, the cuck and the autistic jew"
Why are new dramas usually more funny than new comedies?
Song at the end?
Whoa a movie starring a brown dude?  #2017toolit
Bo burnham is in this :o
OMG VAMPIRE WEEKEND!!
FIFA 17 anyone?
This movie is racist.
LMFAO I pahhdy the hahhdest
Stonehenge could totally rhyme with orange.
haven't seen ray's hair that dark in a long time
What rhymes with Stonehenge? Orange.
so are they going start doing The Indoor Kids podcast again or what!?!?!?!1
bo Burnham is in this?!
#AE911Truth  Google Peter M. Ketcham
Ray Ramano is the white man's version of Stepin Fetchit.
Does anyone know the song that starts at 1:13?
So it's "While you were Sleeping" with a Paki and awkward white guilt... moving on.
this amazing . finally some Pakistani recognition
This is going to be a very nice movie.
Looks funny. The whole "ignorant old white guy" thing is a lazy attempt, but Kumail makes up for it.
A word without a rhyme? Engine.
dinesh you really pissed me off last week in silicon valley
Make 2017 the year of POCs in lead roles please
Please get it released in poland. Pleaseeeee
speaking as a Pakistani, this trailer just made my day.
BO BURNHAM!!!!!!
200k and it's 14th on trending nice
hello person scrolling the comment section... im scrolling the comment section too
another diversity makes us stronger propaganda piece.
Aww this looks cute.
Kumail is hilarious so yeah, I'd watch that. Just one question- why that title?
Well ive seen the whole movie
Wow... Romance is so not my thing... This movie looks well, this is hard to admit, but, good? Promising? Excellent? Heart wrenching or in my case gut wrenching? Ok, that's enough from me I think...
Google says his wife's name is Emily - guess the story checks out
I love Harold and Kumar
What's the song at 1:15?
Want to see this so much
Not gonna lie, this looks good
not a fan of the title
What is the song that starts at 1:16???
looks like a good movie
I'll be there opening night! Kumail + Emily 4Ever
NeoGAF.  Vanillaite is an anti-white racist. Discover his agenda voat.co/v/neofag
Kid Mero will show up to the premiere and wash Ray Romano... He's coming for you Ray, your gonna catch those hands!!!
I don't typically go for rom-coms, but this one looks amazing.
Raymond's kid all grown up, I feel old
Anybody else thinks this looks like 💩?
i lost around a dozen subscribers due to my last video someone help a girl out
Rebecca Bunch wants her balloon back #CrazyExGirlfriend

Kill yourself it won't be painful  - Bo Burnham-
ya like white girl is such a trophy to brown guys?
wow would anyone let their toddler Miss handle a tiny helpless kitten I see very bad parenting here
Good for the cat
No child that small should be handling any animal. I wouldn't let her hold a kitten either. No telling what she could do to either mamma or baby. Stupid parents just sitting there laughing.
Surprised momma cat didnt tear that kids head off. Stupid fuckin parents.
Mom cat was like (Please give me my child.) lol too cute.
why the hell give a toddler a kitten?
NOT funny.  Toddlers shouldn't be allowed to handle tiny animals.
Why do people like babies? I don't at all. Like I really don't like being around them.
The cat is smarter than her owners!  What a bunch of dipsticks!
people are crazy
kitten =/= baby doll and should not be handled like such
Kitten  Mama :   "again stupid parents  they think this is funny - morons.  children  have no real feelings for cats,  to them they're toys,  they're NOT"
Dumb moronic parents the child could have hurt the kitten!
Why would you let the little girl have the kitten.
The cat seemed like a more responsible parent than the one filming.
kids a brat, parents are stupid
Kittens aren't toys. This is cruel.
i was hoping the cat scratched the retarded child
dumbass kid
this kind of thing is EXACTLY why your kids get hurt by animals! stupid dad here! that kid is going to end up getting bit by a dog for this kind of crap! kids and parents suck nowdays!😠
That cat was so brave to take her baby💟 I felt sorry for the baby💜
mama cat had more brains than the moron letting an infant hold a fragile kitten.
I hope the parents made their child understand that the kitten would have to grow up a little more before they could be friends :(
That Father needs a good slap upside the head for being irresponsible for the child and the mother cat!
Momma said "give me my baby".
People are shit
When a cat is a better parent than you...
Dumb stupid little white bitch. You can't have everything fucking.
poor mommy kitty. Imagine someone just snatching your child without your permission and hearing your child call out for help. This child and her parents need to learn how to respect animals and their personal space.
Wtf hu lets a fn lil kid hv a kitten. Good job mama cat took it off her. Stupid adult humans 4 allowing this to happen. Shame on u.
good mommy. that kid shouldnt have been allowed to hold that kitten. HEY STUPID ASS PARENTS TEACH YOUR KIDS HOW TO TREAT ANIMALS RIGHT!!!!  THEN U GET MAD WHEN ANIMALS HURT CHILDREN. DUMB ASSES.
well done mummy cat, you did really well with the baby's.
that was soooooo adorable.  the mama kitty was so gentle even to the baby girl.  haha!  thanks for sharing! !!!
Good on you mommy kitty : Toddlers should not be allowed to handle small animals.
Awesome mama cat
yes,  the family obviously  needs to be killed.  lighten up , a baby held a kitten,  big deal.
fucken idiot why didn't you grab the kitten and give it back to its mum instead of filming it. .that's not cute
The stupid adult watching this should've told the baby to put.the kitten down.  They're lucky the cat didn't scratch the babies eyeballs out!
Kid was lucky the mum cat didnt attack her for distressing the kitten. If roles were reversed and an animal had my kid crying like that.....
"cat parent is smarter than human parent"  seriously, it's not cool to stress out animals like that.
give me back my baby, mofo!
"Bitch, give me back my baby!"
CRYING BRAT!!!!
good the baby could of fallen on the kitten and killed it
Pissess me off how they let a TODDLER hold a helpless little kitten!!!! Toddlers can easily choke baby kittens!
well...mama wanted her baby back.
Damn people down in the comments have some problems..Judging a baby and saying that the kitten was being handle iappropriately. The kitten wasnt in any harm. Overly opinionated ass folks.
good for you mama cat....
They ate the kitten just a short time later.
She needs some TOYS.
WTF? Who does this to a child, a kitten, and a protective mama cat? They all could have been hurt? This isn't funny.
ugh whining babies.
i don't understand why anyone would hand such a young child a kitten....  what are they thinking???
you're lucky that cat didn't swipe that girls eyes out
this is why its not good to have small pets around young children. the children haven't developed a sense of " being extremely careful " yet.  these small animals are not play things and need extra attention to safety
I bet the cat scratches the kids eye out? anybody?  2 to 1??? bet bet bet...lmao
I wish the cat would have scratched the kids eyes out, little fuck
This needs to be titled "dad fail"... Why did you let a toddler handle a kitten and why didn't you step forward to remove the kitten, istead of grabbing your camera?
Funny how the cat is the most responsible adult in that room.
Idiot needs to be punched in the throat, he has no business with a kitten or a baby, a donkey punch to the back of his head is warranted as well, fucking moron!
the cycle​ of life continues.
mother nows best.
child is too young to hold the kitten
Was this supposed to be cute? Cause it wasn't.
Kids suck, and this one was ugly and whiny.
How sad is it when a cat is a better mother than a human.
terrible parents of that child, they should teach her kitten is not a toy,  how irresponsible.
Those people are f'n idiots.  Cat should claw their eyes out.
The cat could have hurt the child but didn't. Many others would not have shown such restraint. I wonder if the adult even realizes how careless this was. How is the cat the only one with an iota of sense!?
mommy cat was worried about her baby wanted to protect kitten good mommy cat
the kitten it upset, get it out of the kid and back to the momma. don't be so stupid to get a video.
A lot of internet experts here apparently think toddlers must be adults. I don't know what the big deal is. A lot of adults act much less intelligent than this toddler when they don't get their way.
What are the "adults" here thinking. This is dangerous to the kitten.
stupid parents
idiot humans....good mamma cat....thankfully she did not take down the baby.

Brilliant video!!!!
You should try molten salt mixed into water with an electric volt going into the water
you would think with all that guys talents you would think he would be creating things to better the world and not wasting time on doofus stuff, but the idiocracy of youtube wins.
that would be fun at a little kids birthday party
smash a like button
Don't give it diet soda or you will give it cancer
The world's newest execution machine...
More videos of the raccoon please
I died laughing at 5:34 #dead
You should do molten glass vs stuff
You gotta make the bar stop halfway (90°) to make the catapult work
I would say this would be good for Rodents of Unusual Size (R.O.U.S), but I don't think they exist.
Great tool if you have Alligator problem.
yo nice mousetrap. im just here to remind you to get diet soda next time. you know, because of the stickyness and stuff .
Am I the only one who is wondering where the hot-wheels cars are in the first (not slow-motion) shot of destroying the volcano?
Good entertainment!
Look at the Coon eat that watermelon
I watch one vid from ur channel and straight up sub
That hard hat only saved itself, that head still go crushed XD
1:12 the sign. HAHA XD!!
End of the video was nice
im going to get flak for this - i hope you did sling a racoon across the yard
Accident waiting to happen.
can you make a shield of somekind out of oobleck?
Cool video, maybe a little less acting
What a cute ending footage. Kawaaaiiiii
So the hard hat one was so awesome! I had to watch it again and again. But when I slowed down the video speed to half speed, one might say that you sounded like you had had on too many.
do a obleck bottle flip ... please
Hey here is something i have wanted to try but dont have a way to melt aluminum: Can you make a prince rupert's drop or something like it out of aluminum or other metals
I farted, and some turds came out.
This guy looks like the old Kuledud3.
Killer! Check out my custom H 1 project on my channel.
Smash a chicken
you can smash your girlfriend
thank you so much for this
Put your neck in there ... Do the planet a favor
this is bullshit...
As a backyard chicken-keeper who has buried entirely too many chickens due to raccoon attack, I would have been perfectly happy to see it used on one of them.
I've got a raccoon problem. Really? You put food out for them, I wonder why they come back?
Lemmi smash
It's not science. You're not a scientist. You're just a danger to yourself and others.
SMASH A RACOON!
It would be nice to see a raccoon  instead of a watermelon. In the opposite case, you've wasted your money and did not solve the problem
Have you tried smashing that girl?
"We're not smashing any Raccoons today"  I'm out of here.
Hey guys, lets see what happens when we try to slice this with a hot knife! Or maybe see what happens under a hydraulic pressure. (every other boring video out there)
http://pickle.nine.com.au/2017/05/04/15/17/giant-mouse-trap-backyard-scientist  You made the news here.
Jigsaw would proud of your trap
This should be called a bear trap and should be used in areas where bears are prominent
Nice stereo bonus for headphone wearers at the end there!
I hate it when people want to get likes on comments         Like if you agree
Right now he has made $2,593 from the 726,114 views of this one video! Its easy to make money on Youtube.
I'd actually like to see you smash some raccoons if that's still on the table
this is the weapon that rivals HowtoBasic
That raccoon was so adorable !!!
This my friends is the reason why women live longer than men.
I'm always worried so badly watching your videos. Just worried something will go wrong 😂.
Smash a smaller mouse trap.
PUT YOUR WANKER IN THERE!
holy clickbait
when the balloon of ooblek popped, looked so satisfying.
I like how the Restricted-Area sign is in the property
Put a knife on it

i dont trust anyones pesto except for my moms sorry johnny boy
looks like throw up
This recipe looks amazing, but the way he speaks is to so weirdly accented that I don't think I'll ever watch any more of his videos...
"real" Genovesian Pesto would be made with Pine-Nuts - These seem like Ceder-Nuts- Justsaying ;)
Why does he talk like that?
How to make pesto by Seth Rogan
I bet he's putting those leaves into a blender between those frame jumps
BANANA SHITSTAIN SLAM MOTHERFUCKING DOGSHIT JAMMA
whoa!! thats SAWESOME!! I made a fresh pesto video a few months ago.. this looks great.. I might update mine! But very similar!
I recently had Pesto made with cashews and nooooooooo.
those upward inflections in his voice are fucking killing me.
it's a pretty accurate recipe, you could really impress someone from italy with this. how much does 4 portions of this cost in usa? just to know. thanks
I hate the way you talk lol I'm sorry
its weird to listen to his instructions becuz its high and low, high and low, high and low etc.
your pesto is a pesto better than resto😍
It's annoying how his voices keeps going up and down in every sentence
what weighs more a 2oz .block of cheese or 2oz. of grated cheese?
"you are after all the boss of making sure your pesto is the besto and better than the resto" ahahaha
Can you give any advice on making this in a big batch... storage and freezing??
Raw pine nuts taste like saw dust.
my mom made this for lunch yesterday and today its in my recommended..illu powa
Chef John's Jeans are so high and tight.
The pitch in your voice, what's going on? Had to stop the video.
I'm italian and that's how you make pesto good job
yes, to make it authentic you gotta use a mortar and pessel, great recipe
I can't stand the way this guys speaks in pulses.
I want this FOOD
This dude's inflection is all over the place.
Anyone else get tired of how this guy speaks?
So much fat hahah

This guy's voice sounds like it can't make up its mind on which pitch it's going to stay in.
This guys inflection 😂😂😂
Chef John is the pastor of his pesto. ¡¡¡Preach!!!

Chef John's pasta fork coiling technique is downright impressive.
Please never let this person narrate another video ever again.
Why does his voice randomly get high when he's talking?
Nothing against the people that run or watch this channel but how the hell is this #24 on top trending on YouTube.
The way he talks triggers me

Black granite for me!
This guy's voice bugs the shit out of me.
this guy is  a genius !!! Point
This whole video sounds like one continuous sentence.

Please tell me you don't actually talk with this insanely fucking annoying voice to people in person
This guys voice kills me
The second I saw the Pesto thumbnail I thought "Chef John is gonna pull out the O'llll Mortar and Pestle". And Voila.
this voice is so annoying
Pesto is the besto
Just made this; tastes way better than store bought and even the same recipe made with a food processor.
I love his voice 🤔
That voice hurts me!!!
*His voice got annoying fast*
The T is silent like the P in swimming...i'm here all week, try the veal.
I can almost smell the basil and garlic through the screen
this guys voice makes me want to chop my balls off.

Is there a way to substitute the pine nuts for something else? This looks amazing but nut allergies are a pain.
wtf is his voice lmfao

The one time the Game Master plays, he loses. But, that means that Connor finally won a challenge LoL

How'd I get from Derek to this? Is he doing something? Or is YouTube getting paid for putting this on Recommended? Jeez all I want is this not to be in my recommended. Ever. Again.
Don't worry, Veritassium fans. Derek is probably making some science experiment with us.
so annoying
Wheels on the bus
Watched your video! Great work! Thumbs up!!! Welcome to my channel!
There reaction to Roger !!😂😇💯❤️
I still watch Sister, Sister till this day on Fuse.
I miss this show, love this show!
OMG I LITERALLY CRIED MY CHILDHOOD !!!!!!!
Why Did i Always Think "Roger" Was The Platinum Selling R&B Singer "Marques Houston" Anyone Else???
Ahhhhhh... it's so refreshing to see a 90's show having a nice reunion😍 What really cracked me up was that she didn't even get to finish her sentence before Tamara and Tia started to scream "NOOOOOOOOOOOO...!"😂
I love this cast so much!
"Go home roger".......(he follows Lisa upstairs)..."your home!"
Y'all happy tia is here now 😑
He changed so much, we are happy for him  He is even a baptized Jehovah's Witness. I never expected it but it turns out he was raised in it too.  Such a great guy
I'm watching sister sister on Fuse right now, what a coincidence...
Go home, Roger!

When Tia was poking at Rogers arm I don't know if I almost LOL'd or cried, this is so beautiful ❤❤
I am smiling like an idiot right now, why are my eyes welling up. This is amazing❤❤
Tia n Tameras reaction is just to cute for words❤️

Roger go home!
its time for joselin to go

Always been a fan of them and still watch they show til this day😀
I'm smiling like I was on the show with them 😂
And then I remember that oh so funny line Tia and Tamera would say. (GO HOME ROGER) 😂😂😂
They may be identical twins but I can see the differences between them ( without looking where the mole is)
Now.. GO HOME ROGER!!
I thought tia would never get a invite

This will turn any bad day into a great day instantly 👏🏾😁
Legend says he never showed his face since he once did the "got your nose" trick, but never got it back.
The last one was camera edited and cut, he cut to hide pinky and used other middle finger and then cut to add pinky back
ON JEBANIY VOLSHEBNIK!!!
Its too old "magic". I have seen it in my childhood and we used to do it schools. These old tricks now go "viral"! OMG!!!
I hope u have monetized your video
Beatiful CGI
Since you're soo good with your fingers. Can you try with your toes?       Try me nigga
And thats why people got burned in the medival :D
my brain it hurts
0:06 - speed 0.25
its his middle finger
*The Legend Himself*
This video makes me replay thousand times :/
If my wholes school watched this I'll. be the only one to scream 😂😂😂😂
BURN THE WITCH!!!
Holy crap good job Vincent
You know he's Asian when he has a solved Rubik's cube on his desk.
His grandkids are going to have a crackers of afternoons sitting on his knee
glad hes not my dad
Isn't finger a funny word. Cheers
how'd he do the last one
You're hired
Hi there, there is a user of Facebook called Benjayy. HE's been using your video. Is that you?
Man! You do that last pinky trick SO fast! Couldn't even find the frame where you switch. Just one blurred frame. Well played.
so this is how to get views on youtube these days
wow you pulled it off
hol' up. something's not adding up.
It's hard to "finger" this one out...
instructions not clear.  lost my dick...
But will it blend
Fuck me this is insane
Lose your finger. Lose my mind.
at 0:04 and 0:06 he is bringing his hand under the table and definitely got some fake finger under there lol
I took your thumb!!   And I stole your kidney....
what the hell
I see how he does , I know how to do it . I'm still blown away .
I'm just gonna say it magic is real
i well only be amazed if he removes his thumb an replaces it with his penis
I was pitying this guy for thinking his finger tricks were worthy of a video.  I mean, every 5 year old knows how this is done.  Then...0:13...wtf...
I give it a Thumbs up👍
he feels it in his fingers, he feels it in his toes
There's a lot of garbage on the Trending page, and then there's _this_ video.
He reloads his finger like a gun we should be careful
How is the last one done
That reminds me of the time I wrote a comment on YouTube and it actually wasn't related to the video at all
The last one is levels
Like = No one cares Sub = No one cares Pass this comment = No one cares
Somebody help I took my finger off and I can't get it back on
I don't know guys this may be fake :(
I wonder what he uses those talented fingers for ;)
I was afraid this was just going to be someone literally ripping off their finger or something gruesome. But that's pretty cool.
Imagine this guy fingering his girlfriend.
He just bends his finger back
Was expecting him to rip his own arm off
The trick you can use to fake an injury and skip class!! 😂🤘
This blew my thumbs offff
Fidget spinner
sees first trick "oh that's cool" sees last trick *questions existence*
Everything until the last one 🤔
You can tell he practices his fingers alot, he has 7 speedcubes on his shelf...
Wtf is this sorcery ??
1st trick COOOOOLLL 2nd trick FREAKYYY
There are actually spare fingers inside those boxes in case something goes wrong
i had to watch the last bit about 10 times before I realised how he done it...     ...it was CGI😆
*I can do that with my dick*
Not that good. Easily tell fingers bent, but good try
I could do that too....       If I had fingers
a shame that there was nao thumb nail...
reading the title I thought he was actually going to cut off his thumb
The tricks were good, but the hands are flawless
who else find the hidden cut at the end of the video?
McDonalds your video sucks! GTFO with that fork!
Can you make the same with your penis?
I read that as dumb trick lol
I can see the illusion, can you?
I can do a trick with my poop, it go away when I flush. I must be magic cuz IM THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DO IT IN MY HOME
I have some fingers, but do they have to be mine?
Now what can float? Churches? A DUCK!!! Right!  So, if he weighs less then a duck........( removes all fingers) WITCH! HE'S A WITCH!!!!!
BERENANG DI MANA ?

Yeah, cause Apple and Samsung want your phone to last for more than 2 years.
This guy is a idiot, suits your style Vox
Can I have your old Kindle?
galaxy note 3 is still the best phone imo
Most local Best Buy stores will accept old phones for store credit, which at Best Buy is atleast useful
Oh I tried to fix my iPhone 5. I'm still paying for it after sold it for parts. It was so sad.
I wish I have a drawer full of devices
The map of China is wrong, should include Taiwan province.
Praise be to the iFixit team and the genius community around them! Keep it up!
Phone technology has certainly plateaued in the last 1-2 years. Innovation has slowed. Proof of this is underwhelming new features in phones (e.g. force touch) and affordable flagship phones (e.g. one plus 3)
??? dont get this video... it is a matter of obsolecence mostly... i would use a cool startTAC even now if it had internet, coloured hi-res big screen, apps, processing power etc... but this is why i do not use it!!!!!!
Ironically I'm watching this on my phone 😭
Bring back Project Ara!
I sell every phone I'm not using... That's stupid to store them when they lose value day by day...
lol I don't have one of these
removable battery, in a phone? revolutionary!
I don't even have a phone... you could give me one of yours? in your drawer of sadness
wait replacable batteries are a thing of the past now? didn't realise,    im not rich enough to buy a 1000$ phone that goes one step forward and two steps back i guess
You have all those devices because you don't know what eBay is.
"My phone is my entire life" (Uses an iphone like a teenage girl)
in Japan they are recycling phones for the gold to make gold medals for the 2020 Olympics.
If you're smart enough not to spend 700+ dollars on a phone you're also smart enough to disassemble it
I went through many smartphones but i STILL use my old Samsung flip phone of 7 years.
Watching this on a Moto E 2nd gen 😥
Lmao, give me those old phones man.
I'm from 2025 ,I'm watching this on a napkin
imagine fair phone fells down nd  you need assemble the mess again
This guy is sooo lost, he didn't know anything about phones
"OH WOW YOU CAN CHANGE THE BATTERY" What a truly revolutionary invention.
Dr. M. Sanjayan, I love your Vox videos! Keep them coming, let's educate these cats!
ever heard of craiglist as soon as u get a new device???
all my old phones are duds or given away to my broke friends.
An still apple wil ask us alot of money for recycling our old iphone
Seriously is this a Vox video? Why wouldn't you investigate or discuss whatever happened to Google's Project Ara? The real waste was 8 mins of people's time.
i care about the cost > environment/ recycling
Most phone manufacturers in India still use disposable batteries. The market here is huge for phone batteries.
This video makes me sad because my mom had this and we lost all of our stuff in a auction
What about Apple making efforts to shut down the repair market?
What about security?  Isn't a phone from 30 years ago rather easily hacked?
My draw looks almost like such. I even have similar items in the draw as well. Great information! I hope a recycling plan becomes more intentional and people actually use it.
why would you get a new phone when the old one still works? wasteful
try bitcoin mining with the junk phones
just sell it on eBay or something
This guy is looks like the uncle I don't wanna talk to
What people want is to be able to replace other things than the battery, like the ram, storage, etc. If this can be replaced however you want you'd keep the same phone forever.
Because your don't sell them
Google and Apple forcing operating system upgrades that older phones can't run is the real issue. Many people would be happy with an older model but the OS designers make it impossible.
The new regs on how computer gear is made means the printing on your keyboard keys wear off within a year. Not cool.
because they can rip you off, whats so hard to understand
Drawer of sadness? I sell my old phones so I can afford to eat...
He said his phone was his life  My computer is my life
Why does this guy have a Mao Zedong poster on his wall in the first scene?
siri: "hey liam, what are you doing for earth day" liam:"imma tear that ASS UP"
"Everyone has one of these."  Uhh, no. I almost always sell mine. It's a waste to leave them in a drawer when they could actually be of use to someone else.
I believe many just buy new phones not just because they are broken but that they want a faster one or with more capacity or something.
1:55 wrong way of showing how a sink works. The important thing is water stays in and prevents air from below to get up that way.
Wait, you don't sell your devices to pay for your new ones? Who the hell keeps a drawer full of stuff that could make them money?
Apple usually shreds their phones for disposal secretly
I'm actually shocked that there are phones without removable batteries, I thought this was normal? How else will you forcefully shutdown your phone when it's acting up again?
That ipod classic can worth some money if it's in good condition...just saying
First indian dude i actually respect
1.4 billion phones were produced last year, not every year...
"Everyone has one of these [drawer full of phones]"... I guess I'm broke.
R.I.P project Ara..
I still use my moto g (2013) :/ there is some sentimental connection to it. Dunno how ppl swap out their phone so often!
0:21 that poster of Mao tho lol
This is buzzfeed but with a purpose behind it 
Apple was responsible for getting rid of removable batteries, making phones and computers unrepairable, and shortening the lifespan of phones. And now they are the environment friendly company for creating Liam?
hmm, Americans replace their phones every two years you say? interesting... that's the typical contract/upgrade length with the major companies... seems like a racket
The Mao poster is plain bad taste.
These types of videos are hard to enjoy. I can't help but think that the largest companies won't do anything to incorporate this stuff into their phones.
This video was going great then it turned into a commercial.
I'm glad this video was made. It's never before crossed my mind but now this really makes me think
The title of the video makes no sense at all.
*takes out battery* "wow" uhhhhh wat?
why don't you recycle them if you want them to go away...
not everyone have one of those dude
Why is there a Chinese communist propaganda poster in the background?
wait why has the dude a poster of Mao in his wall
the need for better batteries is so important. yet consumers still want phones to get thinner and thinner.
but what about water proofing after opening up the phone?
Your parents threw your old pacifiers in a drawer, so it only makes sense that you throw your new pacifier in a drawer too...
i like this new series
ITS BRAAAYDEEEEN

Anyone else got a shitty screen in the beginning of the video
to much cousin but funny bitch
It's bubbles
Does anyone notice that at first troy starts with 80k MT then after Troy bought kerr  turns into 82,490k or is it just me?!
Right now, it's almost impossible to shoot threes because the game doesn't allow you to score. It's crazy because you have to shoot 25 threes to score 5. What the fuck is that???
Isaiah didn't lose the game
Remember bald wendy
Isaiah Thomas scored 53 points
U said I t lost the game when he lost his tooth are u fucking retarted he smoked them

Troydan got Nick Young for 10K MT, ended up being his best scorer on that game.
When you only take D- and F shots and complain you don't hit anything
Great spanish troydan
At 0:29 his eyes was so red he looked high asf
"lost a tooth and the game."...please watch more basketball...
Not trying to expose or anything but you didn't buy the nick young for 10k js
your saying that one dude cant make a shot but your shooting stupid shit with him thats why
3:44 the Celtics won? 😂
Isaiah won the game
Is Kd wearing okc thunder jersey on the nba 2k17 cover in the starting of the video
The reason you aren't making shots is because you need a better release and you're taking terrible shots
8=D 8=================D

Sorry for raging in your stream yesterday
Swaggy p isn't a disappointment
Don't let this bullshit distract you from knowing that Cops is filmed on location with the men and women of law enforcement. All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
Like or you will be as ugly as Tryodan one day!!
lmao😂😂😂 he bpught daniel gibson ruby for 2000 when he is gping for 950-1000
Su hope your dog poops your bed
Nick was good on the wizards not the best but decent dunker.
Shut your fucking mouth when I'm talking
I use a ruby Daniel Gibson and it's really good.
I'm sure the UK charities are completely legit..... why the omission?
Where's autism speaks?
Anyone profiting on cancer should have to deal with chemo. I have cancer. So fuck them.
This is why I feed stray animals ( and TRN) directly and give food to the homeless directly
@TopTenz... Make a video on the top ten good charities.
I hate most the "education" charities. "Breast cancer awareness" I'm pretty sure everyone is aware of breast cancer, we don't need to provide millions to things like this. Those affected need it far more.
I'd say the Clinton Foundation should be on this list except their corruption isn't a secret.
Hillary should be on here,this entire list would barely fill her pocket.
The Clinton Foundation is missing, those you listed are cashing in peanuts compared to them.
I have never heard of a single organization on this list
Why no autism speaks? They want to eliminate all autistic people on the planet!
Well there is a special place in hell for them.
You forgot number one with a bullet.  The Clinton Fondation
Autism Speaks, they spread more hate of Autistic people then they claim to help.
Why is every charity on this list American?
Charities are for taxevasion of rich people, not to actually help People. R u living under a rock or what?
Autism Speaks? Only 4% of their budget in 2010 went to actually helping families with autistic relatives.
to think i know where project cure is but its in a 15 min drive.
How about we simply JAIL the greedy solicitors and others who feed on these 'charities'
this is why I don't donate. there's absolutely nothing charitable or good contributions in this country.
I've never donated to a charity and I never will donate to one.
pisses me off to no end
i mean the childrens wish foundation got me an alienware pc,  a corsair keyboard, a logitech mouse, and a 34" widescreen monitor from lg, sooooo.
The Clinton Foundation should be #1 with $2 billion collected and less than 10% to the needy.
I'm surprised PETA wasn't on here
dirty greedy scum bags, basically stealing money off good natured people. This makes me so mad x   you should do a episode about corrupt politicians or corrupt big business
http://www.plumfund.com/pet-fund/sphynx-cat-dream
The breast cancer foundation is corrupt?! My Girl Scouts troop supported that charity... I wish I knew.
is it me or does this guy look like kinda like mathew  santoro
What about FemFreq
I can't name a single large charity that isn't corrupt...
What about the Humane Society?  Is it true that only 1% of donations goes to help animals?
i am honestly Surprised the salvation army and saint vincent de pauls charity's were not on here. i don't think breast cancer cure foundation was on here either.
Now duw the top best charities :)
His voice is hot
you left out PETA
Well there is a special place in hell for all these people
wait i thought the US Govt was the most corrupt charity?
Add wounded warrior project to that list.
No autism speaks? They're positively terrible
missing simon too much :( come back!
If it is "secret" how do you know about it?
What happened to Simon?
And there are still people out there who probably  think I'm an awful person for hanging up on the solicitors.
Where's the FOP?
Great video! Always nice to know where my money shouldn't go.
well I know which charities not to donate to now!
it's seems that it's the lawyers that are the crooks not the charity
Clinton Foundation...a charity helping to fund HRC campaign.
I love the way Simon says-Let's get stahted.  As if I wasn't already cynical enough, I see a video like this.  It just makes me shake my head at all the dishonesty in the world.
Bring back the intro with Simon!! it made the videos more intimate. Without the intro it's just like 'here you go fact pigs, eat up, we don't care'.
.... time to start my own
come back! I like when you show yourself explaining everything in the video.
Maybe do a list of the top 10 charities as a counterpoint.  Or something like top 10 ways to help your community or something.
Unfortunately I get the feeling that most people that donate to charity only do it to write it off on their taxes and grow their tax refund
How can this be legal!!???
darn I thought politicians would top the list.
I tend to support charities where I have friends or family who work or volunteer for that charity. You know money is going to Haitian orphans when you have close friends who visit the orphanage every few months.
I know I am supposed to be shocked by this; but for some reason I am not.  When I do fundraisers; 100% of what ever is raised goes to the actual benefactor of the fundraiser.
Most of them barely do anything.
Notice greedy lawyers always gets a fat share of the funds.
Notice greedy lawyers always gets a fat share of the funds.
You left out: Planned Parenthood, Red Cross and the Clinton's Home Charity Organizations.
Can you do top 10 honest/best charities to donate tp?
you forgot the Clinton Foundation
This is why I don't donate to charity at all. All charities cannot be trusted at all.
Are there ANY charities you can trust?
Giving the money directly to the family in need and bypass the middle greedy bastards sounds like a good idea/ideal.  I get those two confused.
I love Screen Rant videos 😊
Oh relax. It's Disney..
Chicken Run
Chicken Walk Chicken Man
These are kid movies so who really cares if they are real or not
screenrant y'all r bullshit
OMG THE FIL ISNT ZOOTOPIA ITS ZOOTROPILIS
"mistakes".  It's a fictional story. It's not like they're trying to make documentaries or something.
if thats so then planes and cars can't talk and frogs can't turn to princes, and disney was a mistake itself
these are cartoons my god
this guy is retarted
Seriously? I mean they are children's animated movies.
and it's an animated movie and it's not supposed to be exactly like real life
the emojis are chicken run
It is disney so everything is not real and it is conceived so not everything is exactly as in the real so they are not mistakes
Well now 1M people know
chicken little
You know that these are fictional movies right?
🐓🏃means chicken run
JUST DEAL WITH IT
how about you just enjoy the movies that people make instead of complaining about them
im just 9 years old the reason why i watch movies is becuz of my sister (cuz i need to keep an eye on her)😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
what​ is the movie described by the emoji?
HE JUST RUINED ALL OF THE FILMS AHHHHHH IM SO MAD, DISLIKE FOR SURE
It's not supposed to be real, it's Disney!
Chicken little
In cars 2 McQueen race against a f1 car but he's an NASCAR that is a big difference between f1 and NASCAR
Moana just sounds like frozen to me
critics took to a whole new level!
the emojis are chicken run I just looked at them and didn't watch the whole thing it was so ez
most of the mistakes are so insignificant that noone cares
Well i got caught by 1.093.104 people
That ome is chicken little
I guess chicken run

Thanks for ruining some of the best Disney movies😡
Good to know but dude it's a cartoon??? A cartoon let's yours imagination run wild if you wanted it to be perfect without a mistake watch tv
just ruined finding dory
Um, maybe I'm missing something, but the Union Jack in Cars looks identical to the real one shown up close. Is that just me or did they get this wrong?
Who give a damn it's a Disney moovie
i have never heard of hena and im a kiwi hena is bs maui is moari
chicken little
Your ranting about a movie based on a girl with hair that is long enough to go down an entire tower?!??
I know the movie chicken run
lol is it meant to mean chicken run?
hmm, I will update my data after some research ;) Thanks for notifying
Chicken run  For the emojis Saw it and already knew
chicken little emojis
Its cartoons you wanker.
their all cartoons, of course every single bit of detail isn't going to be right
Damn so they miss minor details it's hard making a movie
Half of these are kind of ridiculous because they are meant to be crazy or kid friendly.
Stop ruining childhoods.
You're trying wayyyyyy too hard in this vid. I was just waiting for you to say something like "the frog could not have turned into a human in this movie"
Little chicken
Chicken on the run
I'm so happy animals and cars really do talk.
Chicken run is the emojis
Really? You just debunk your own saying at 7:58 if you take a close look at the flag.
dinosaurs are still alive
7:58 Look a little closer.
emogie,  "chicken little"
i love these movies
So the gate opens for the special events, what's the problem if it opens for a race?
You seriously Put Cars on this list? "Zootopia is better viewing because you go into it knowing it's fiction"  Last time I checked, no kid went into Cars, or ANY of these movies thinking they were real
I guess your child is going to be raised with only Historic Facts and no creativity
Nice work Screen Rant, but Disney Movies aren't really made for quizzes and tests, they're made for entertainment
It is just a movie let it be!
Me too I love how much work they put into their videos :)
i saw an f4u corsair at 8:40
PLANES ISN'T DISNEY

I LOVE ENTOURAGE
When Joe made that sound with the microphone I think he deafen me
but Josh's face at 9:45
Pineapples don't grow on trees...
i siad it was a sugestion
i love how Caspar hugged you after giving him the pineapple omg😂
Caspar is a precious cinnamonbun
Look at Josh's face on 9:55
He didn't say why he sent that package off?!??
I'm sure joe never told us what that thing he took to the mail was
I love Caspar and Joe's relationship!
Casper's smile is so genuine and adorable!
Was there no Tresspass
"It's a family meal! And Josh."
your the best youtuber everrrrrrrrr
Casper can you please shout me out and joe xx
When Joe was folding up that parcel at the beginning it was so satisfying it should be in a satisfying video compilation
I wondered why the fuck you were sleeping in a tent in the prank video
Joe can pitch a tent in my room any time.
Is Casper birthday on the 27th because that was my birthday
WHOOOOO LIVES IN A PINEAPPLE UNDER THE SEA  CASPAR LEEEEE
does anyone know where Caspar got the disposable charger from?!
17:30 my ears are bleeding😭😭
I still can't believe joe and josh had a threesome
Look at joshes face at 9.49 in the vid
Look at joshes face at 19:45
So what was that pathology specimen for?
Joe will u plz just get a vlog camera ur phone is so annoying
5:09 😂😂😂😂😂😂
With birthday cards you should put glitter or sequins to prank them.
joe bought my tent
the last of us 2 is coming out pls do it on your baking channel when it does!!
Omg I couldn't stop laughing at josh when Caspar was reading his card😂💓
How many people live with Casper Lee?
Whilst you guys were indoor camping, I was actually camping for my Dofe silver and omg I'm I glad to be home 😂
Benji is so hot
Your shoulders look good
9:47 Josh is Mr jealous 😂😂😂
@3:16 I haven't had one of those in like 4 or 5 years lol
Has anyone realised that most vloggers do not have cars. They just always take an uber 😂 some vloggers do have cars but they don't even use it, they also prefer the uber lmao.
Love this Vlog!

Josh's green feet😂
joe pineapples dont grow on trees they grow on bushes I was disappointed too...

can you do a house tour plz joe old buddy old fwend
Josh's face when Caspar was reading out his card 😂😂😂
U know they didn't win anything good with the scratch tickets because it wasn't the title of the video 😂
Joe should buy a fake scratch card and give it to Caspar to make him think that he won do that for the next prank😋
Joe's first cricket throw was actually correct but cos it was mini I wouldn't have worked.
Caspar looks like he wanted to cry when reading the card Joe gave him #JasparForLife
Love how often Joe is shirtless 😍
Yes!! Another vlog!!
You should try actual camping!
who else thinks that caspar looks like leo from charmed 😂
Omg this is where I work 5 mins away. Ohh I wish I say you guys
Josh face at 9:56 omg hilarious!
Rick and Morty on 13:42? :)
Great video! Love the Rick and Morty references @ 3:36 & 13:42.
im scared afffffffffffffff
Loved the rick and morty at 3:30
Human selfishness moves ourselves forward..i dont against the idea.  but i just want to live the way i am right now.
lol rick and morty and dragon ball references
Let me be immortal! :D
Genetically modify lab mice to not feel pain? Maybe..? Just maybe...?
I love this YouTube channel,He inspires me to continue my engineering Thank you
Do not pervert life
please please please please please please please please make me a reptile
this video made me wish i was born in a hundred years where CRISPR 2.0 existed
did you know that the people of the middle ages thought that people with down syndrome were angels because they were so nice.
why do people dislike this.
Adding new stuff to the Genepool? I'm all for that!
Its probably going to be expensive af to ensure your baby won't have any diseases
They would probably design a lot of pretty white females
was that rick and morty easter egg  https://youtu.be/jAhjPd4uNFY?t=826
Rick and Morty cameo, best episode ever!
pro about prolonged life spans is it makes interstellar travel more palatable.
If science classes where these videos I'd have several Nobel Peace prizes by now. And several detached homes on Mars And Venus.
3:35 M-morty why the fuck am I in this video  Gee I dunno rick
DNA diversity gives rise to exceptional talent - for example some very autistic people make the greatest inventions. Often, it looks like a trade-off.
Smart billionaire?  *elon musk comes running from the distance*
any one with a gun can you please send me one or at least a one way ticket to mars. I have given up hope for the human race.
They're gonna make a mistake in the editing of a gene and start a zombie apocalypse
Just watch everybody, this is how a zombie apocalypse is gonna start
The equation in the top right corner at 7:06 is approximately 2.97069.
This is still the greatest Kurzgesagt video of all time.
Count me in the living forever thing! There are so many things to explore and i dont want to miss them!!!!
We will be able to make Space Marines real
In a nutshell..... *16 minutes long*
a video where the narathor says something like: never should the line between something and something should never be blurred again.plz halp
Don't get optimistic  the fact that people get sick generates 100s of billions of dollars, so the powerful and the rich will keep all of those to their selves and hide it from us, its already happening.
so many movie references! XD your channel is amazing at teaching science, and I've now got to admit, it's my favorite one 😊 thanks for showing us things like this Kurgesaght. Keep up the good work/Videos 👍
13:43 Cheeky Rick and Morty slip in
if this could be possible there could be the next rise of genetic racism
So technically we can manipulate with our DNA when it comes to modification when we became adults or is it only possible throug embryo?
15:33 Space Odyssey?
kamehameha!
there goes rick with his green alcohol mouth slime and morty's hanging fish mouth
i have a queation, can tou geneticlt modify yourself after you are born?
It is horrible that all those innocent Down babies are killed :(
I don't have to imagine having been alive in the 1980s. I was there. lol
I want it to develop faster! NOAW
Haha Rick and Morty
I think living forever would be stupid XD. I think it is not a bad thing or a good thing to due. You will go to heaven! (OR what other things you believe in!)
Great video
Scared? Frightened? HELL NO! This actually makes me really excited, i could feel my heart racing with excitement. Bring on CRISPR!
ok but did yall consider EXTRA COLOR RODS
I cant believe there are no comments about that Rick and Morty reference at 13:46
you all did a stunning job !!!!  indeed a tool that will change the course of humanity and of all of the species around us
this wont end well
Just WOOW !
No more ugly Niggers and no more ugly Asians ...   HAHAHAHAAAAAAAAA
was that fucking rick and morty near the end
cool now i can lose my Mexican immigrants status and turn into a cis gendered straight white male
Mein Gott! The Nazis have have their Aryan master after all! Well, at least until somebody else makes a black Super Saiyan...
1:31 wut??? is that living thing???
One day, our ancestors will be able to turn into Super-Saiyajins.
Let's ask the real question. Can we end hunger with this?
Maybe you could put some concept deffinitions in the description
Designer babies? Hmmm... sounds a lot like paradigm
All of the 3,446 haters on this vid are either stupid or retarded or stupidly-retarded    like if u agree
we dont need modified humans. we need more animals and trees
3:34 Rick and Morty!
How can you become a genetic engineer?
comment all easter eggs on this comment
8:03 the thumbnail
Everything dies, on your deathbed it won't matter if you've lived ten years or a thousand years, only the present is truly real. When you die, that will be your reality. How long you live is irrelevant to existence.
it's inevitable - we need gene editing if we are to colonize space.  SCIENCE RULES !
The modified children remind me of divergent. They tried to modify genetics and look what happened.
So will eugenics come back?
if nearly everyone were exceptionally good looking, wouldn't that create a reverse effect where ugly people are now the most sought after? although by ugly people=/=deformed.
Make sure Hermione from Harry Potter does not see this video. (Because she's a "Mudblood!")
12:16 Mudblood! I love that bit!
The topic that this channel should use, is how to pronounce the name of this channel.
did anyone see Rick and Morty!?
WE CAN MAKE SUPAH SAIYANS!!!

great work Craig and info wars!  Craign looks very much like Stewart Swerlow, could be brothers (also for the same goal :) Can't wait to have this happen, that we get all these abusers
We will NOT let our  little ones be victimized by these psychopaths. Over our dead bodies! We need to stand up and fight back.
Yes, but we have a president who is terrified and is willing to DO AS HE IS TOLD. I don't think we have a president now... Makes me sad/angry, but we have to face the fact that we are ON OUR OWN.
I honestly have to thank this man, it's a hard pill to swallow, his bravery is much respected.
Brainwash lunatics.
Will the names of high level pedophiles be in the film?
Please take note of this VERY IMPORTANT message, Vets are doing a very important thing for children and to shine the light on the bad guys.  With Kindness, Elizabeth
*The CIA* is on their charity website? LOL
Praise God! This work is needed. Leave it to our USA Military hearts and minds to take this on and bring justice for criminal behavior.
RIGHT ON BROTHER! GET THEM, FILTHY BASTARD SCUM!
Satanic child abusers the last time i checked it is Christians who attack little children just saying
Alll you elite sicko's are going to prison. IF you make it there.
If what he said is true and their arrested , good, but untill we see banker elite and congressmen arrested and why. nothing will change
If there were thousands of arrests of high profile pedos in Washington, wouldn't there be numerous videos of the arrests taking place by neighbors or passers by?
Death to all satanic pedos!!
do it fast.keep the circle tight and small. and watch yourselves.
great man, for the first time I have a lot of respect for a seal
God bless him. Our prays with that case.
Man I knew I should have gone to the NRA show this guy is one of my heroes I would have loved to have the chance to see the Saw Man Sawyer
God bless this man and all who share in this mission.
God bless this man !!!
We're behind you.  The time is drawing near
how could aynone press the unlike button ??????????????????????? THUMBS UP !!!!
Where. Are. The. Evidence.
43 Pedophiles have down voted this video.
Saw Man Sawyer a yank I can respect
Much prayer for the Truth to come out and Protect the People WHO telling the Truth
May God bless, support, and protect this man.  Pray for him.
41 dislikes...likely pedophile elites
God Bless this patriot with guts!Thank you sir!
Good job.  Get those sons of bitches without mercy.
39 pedophile faggots disliked this video, off with those demons heads, how dare they harm gods children!!!
Why not add the site address info to the heading or is the site not ready?
This guy looks so much like arnold schwarzenegger
They will get nowhere with this unless they can get to the children that are bred for sacrifice. They need an insider informant - or a video.
shared..and thank you for saving the children!
Those people arrested should have their names exposed. Every heinous crime reported always identifies the perp. Why should this be different?  It won't stop until you expose them.
Will pray for this in Jesus name. Pray for God's protection.
As a mother, I cannot begin to express how much I appreciate & respect what you are doing. Thank you & all who support you. You are all heroes to the victims, whether they know it or not.
This is happening all over the world. The monarchy and the Vatican are involved in pedophilia and satanic rituals. It's going to be hard to punish these bastards! 
Craig, Where do the Green Mtn boys sign up?  Good work bro....
It's a scam don't give the cuck any money he's not doing any thing and he has no authority to do anything
I looked up the website and it is about vets but says nothing.....cyber attack?
Love this guy!!!!
Give us the link please
Can I join, as a NON-Vet? I have serious connections though. LE 2 mili, etc.  ❓❓❓❔❓❓❓
I LOVE YOU INFO WARS❤️ The whole team and their supporters. YOU GUYS ARE FUCKING AMAZING!!
This is Lucifers world and money IS the Root Of All Evil.
BRO I THOUGHT THAT WAS A FLOATING SHOTGUN
I really hope this guy doesn't commit suicide.
i used to do this on small scale i used to find these bastards and tear them apart in all ways
I will donate to the cause 👍
Religious or not, Satanic cults are wrong. If you're anti religious all the better to end Satanism.
NAMES RELEASE NAMES
Asssaunge should be protected as a crimimal exposer
Go get them allll) and EXPOSE THEM TO THE WORLD. JUST BE SAFE!. God is woth you against these killers
39 Downvotes? John Podesta is that you?
Good luck to you Craig sawyer. Top man. I'd hang the bastards
Woo-hoo take em down my brother 
have him set up a Patreon acct. ..if 200,000 of your subscribers donate $1.00 a month this would help them tremendously....just an idea :)
Thank goodness a hero VEt knows how to pronounce the work elite properly.
38 pedophiles downvoted this video.

Trump is doing a really good job like we all expected ! it's only been 100 days and hes blown past what the past Presidents have done, GOD Bless Trump Amen.
Awesome work brothers! I am sending funds to your pay pal account and am going to get my friends and family involved. Be careful and God bless you.
nasty elite scummm. Omg again the large media covering the same animals...keep the good work...
Trump must have been taken to the wood shed with China. One meeting with them and he completely changed his views.
Praying for you Craig! Be safe!!
Willie Nelson is talented.
This is music, n I'm a late 90s baby🤣
Better Than Don Thrilla
WE LOVE YOU WILLIE!
not for long xD
ohhhhhh I want to smoke with him sooooooo bad
Finally the only song that is considered music and it's trending!!!!!
is this a parody?
I've loved Willie for a long time, and I gotta say that I think this is one of his best songs. It captures the wit, the voice and the style that makes Willie's songs so great really good.
Don thrilla kys
L E G E N D
Help Willie , just watch  ezpz
Man who is this Don Thrilla guy????
Anyone else think this engineered this should be fired? Obvious signs pitch correction on Willies vocals... Cant believe that made it through to the final release.
Willie Nelson will always be a true legend and still making good music at 84 years old
The BIGGEST Blunts In The WORLD!
Positive thoughts Prayers move Mountains and he has nothing less than than the Purest of Karma. Willie Forever along side Waylon We will know when they Are Together.
long live Willie
Ever heard of Don Thrilla? He is a bitch
Charles Manson can relate
this killed me, I love it, thanks Willie!
love this song willie
Willie stilllll  Da Bomb !   after years...and years....and years~   NObody is as good/brilliant as Willie !   NObody.....don't care whaaat ya say!  LOL
Bless you, Willie Nelson!
Still not Dead ➖ he should be.
Willie should go on JRE.
I hate the classic country but I have really big respect for Willy Nelson, he is a legend
Very Nice,..
Keep smoking the herbs
I was reading up about willie. he has defiantly had one of the most interesting lives/careers ever.  God bless.
God bless Willie Nelson.
Willie you are a genius
I wanna smoke with willy
coulda skipped the auto tune... but great song nonetheless!
I love this song
thumb up for legend grandpa 👴👴
Willie and Trigger live on and on
10/10 man I love this freaking song
Hehehe I love this. You better not die anytime soon. I'm 20 years old and you're one of my favorites along with the old gang. That should give you hope for the future generation at least some :)
Bless Willy. I actually might cry the day Willie passes. He is a truly good soul.
This is his best song ever. Period.
Unban Ice Poseidon he didn't do anything wrong!
Hell yeah!! Smoke weed everyday!!!!😌
This is my theme song
btw he is 83 years old
Name me an Artist better than Don Thrilla and I will probably email you $100
Willies music, the style it's amazing how he's himself, creative, his own style, his voice, what i really like about Willie Nelson is he's himself, i love reabeating it.
Anyone else notice the auto-tune on his voice? Weird...  Willie sounds good just the way he is
Pretty close though
man who tf is this
I hope I live long enough to get to see Willie live in concert before I die....... I am afraid that will not happen......
this is an awww song!!! this song made my day....and will make my day everytime I hear it
Willie is one of the best in the rap game.
Willie, I want to be just like you when I grow up! :-D
I'm black I can never play this in my projects But much respect to willie
God, I wish Willie was my Grandpa. What a champ!  Plus, I bet he'd give me lots of free weed.
I love willie
Fantastic song. Love the new record, Willie. Keep on keepin' on!
Love it Willie!
Great stuff - Smoke weed everyday That's our Willie.
This song and this comment section gives me so much life!! Uhhhhh!!!
SMOKE WEED EVERYDAY.
84 is the new 40
https://youtu.be/-iigkMzz0p8
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE A LEGEND HOMIEE
luv it willie!
Shit when the classic country singers die there won't be anymore true music and what I mean by that is they wrote the song and didn't use auto tune
fun fact: willies roadie is much older than Willie, look him up... dudes in his 90s
I woke up still not dead again today
Can y'all sub
Willie always was a crazy 'ol coot, and I wouldn't want him any other way. 😎
TRIGGER WILL NEVER DIE!!!!
84 years old, looking 60 and still doing amazing music... That weed is not from this planet.
April 30th 2017 - Happy 84th birthday, Willie.

who else saw gamzee
Haven't you stolen this idea from +Disunplugged
Dude ...  1900 Park fair is awesome how can you not like have the chef make eggs made your way that's why Love it .. but to each his own I'm not a fan of the garden grill no Cinderella royal table .
i hateddddd ohana! the service was slow and the food cold when it got to us! the waiter also provided some of the worst service we have had on disney property
Haha, that's why they put the more "royalty" characters in 1900 park fare: to make up for the service and food.
I agree with you when it comes to the Crystal Palace.  I went there in September 2015 and the food got me sick the next morning.
Tusker House is always a must for my group.  The bread pudding with vanilla is great
My least favorite character meal restaurant is Akershus at epcot. The characters weren't great and I hated the food
We have always loved the Garden Grill - I hope it doesn't get too much more crowded so that you can't make reservations. Their food is AMAZING. And I didn't love Park Faire, either. The worst is that it's so dark.
on our last visit we visited Garden Grill and absolutely loved it! Their food is amazing, service was amazing and the characters were awesome!!!
Absolutely  agree, 1900 Park Fare was mediocre at best. It felt like we were in a marathon with no down time to enjoy the meal.
Drizella and Anastasia meet every day in MK
Garden Grill is our family favorite. Between food and characters it's awesome. But I think the reason we like it most is that you feel relaxed while eating. Was very disappointed at Be Our Guest
I loved Ohoa and so did my kids.💖
When I went to Magic Kingdom I loved the Crystal Palace. Very fun experience.
Cape May character breakfast??? It would be close to Epcot for convience. But is it good?
Question. What do you think about the character breakfast at Beach Club? I think that's the one with Minnie...Don't hear a lot about it. Just curious. Wanting to try somewhere different.
I agree 1900 Park Fare is my least favorite as well because the times I went years ago, it was SOO BUSYYYY! It was always packed and the characters did seem to take ages to come over to our table. Food was alright too.
For my family Tusker House is the best. We think it's one of the best buffets on property. Hollywood and Vine is by far the worst. Loud, crowded, sub par characters and even worse food.
The mice usually only appear at Park Fare if the Stepsisters are not there btw.
1900 Park Fare is bad.....we won't go back.
Wouldn't have considered restaurant size vs. character availability. Good points. I'm personally not into character dining but friends with kids are always asking so it's good to know where to direct them.
How can you NOT put Hollywood and Vine on your worst list?
The Step Sisters and Lady Tremaine are always out in the park. Every day at Magic Kingdom, near PFTH.
I agree with your picks, but you forgot, in my opinion, the best one....Chef Mickey! : )
everything tastes bad in disney it's filled with antibiotics or maybe Disney's too poor to afford good chefs like from Jersey where people hate disney
I agree with you!
Did they FINALLY fix the rotation at Garden Grill? Our favorite character meal is Tusker House.
I'm with you on this best and worst list.  I had a very bad experience at Crystal because the food was just horrible.  I don't blame Pooh and friends for the meal in anyway.
love these videos! keep it up! As far as your worst I couldn't agree more. for such cool characters​ you would think they could do better on the actual food. it's just not great food and I wish that would change.
I have been watching you guys for a while!! These videos are great!! I also love how you added least favorites, it gives me a lot to think about when I go for my trips!!
I'm a Donald and Daisy Duck fan, so I love the character meal over at Tusker House :)
Love Garden Grill! Been there for breakfast a few times and it is a must do for us every time. Chip and Dale are always hilarious and that salsa is to die for!
I'm not saying 1900 fare is the best but all I know is that they literally let me take the entire platter of bacon at the buffet line. That has to count for something
I'll be at epcot next saturday and I literally just booked garden grill for breakfast as I was watching this video!
I had a dreadful experience at 1900 Park Fare over 10 years ago and we never went back, I'm sad to see that it looks like it hasn't gotten any better.
Does anyone else think this guy's voice sounds a lot like Morty's from Rick and Morty?
Tusker House ranks #1 for me.
This was very well down with good info based on very practical recommendations.
I am going to Ohana and Crystal Palace for my first trip in May. Wish me luck!!
Agree with 1900, rushed and busy, BUT CRYSTAL PALACE NOOOOOOOO!!!!
I can't think of a worst character meal, but I love Cinderella's Royal Table and Tusker House for their character lunch.
I'm doing my first character meal in September and it took me forever debating over the reviews and menus before I finally settled on 1900 Park Fare. I sincerely hope I haven't made a huge mistake. :(
Enjoyed the video, Joey!
It's a shame that the "worst" are both in the most beautiful locations in all of Disney. Thanks for the review.
The WORST character dining in my opinion is Hollywood and Vine, worst food and so loud. We LOVE Ohana and Tusker House. Cape May is a breakfast tradition for us before we got to EPCOT for the day.
What does everyone think about Akershus?
I know it's weird but thanks for the honesty for the "worst". If I spend all that money at Disney and plan it for months, it's best for me to maximize my stay and eat at the better places
I agree about 1900 Park Fare, it feels a little claustrophobic with the lack of windows. The upside for us was the mad hatter, he was awesome.
Video feat. IdubbbzTV over on the second channel. Some Hawaiian chickens got what was coming to them►: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsoTnSRePA
This is what you do on vacations?
Are you fucking autistic?
he went to the store where all my school's weaboos go
Uses his girlfriend as a basket.
YES MORE MTG
You look like a southeast England chav.
5:22 when max didn't say money shot
that Wal-Mart has a tiny selection of cards?! Hell my Wal-Mart barely put cards back on the shelfs due to stealing, and even then they're 3 tiny display racks.
Honestly I wanna see the mew and mewtwo box first.
The mystery magic boxes are garbage. Sorry you wasted your money man
you look like devo in that hat
marokanen pet take it off
take that fucking gucci hat off. that's not for you. bad boy. no
Get rid of that fucking Gucci hat. Any other hat would be fine, as long as it isn't Gucci.
The Mystery Power Boxes are hard to find everywhere in the US, not just Hawaii.
was that his girlfriend?
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas more magic
turning off adblock so you will have enough money to get a new phone that isn't broken =P
boi that gucci cap makes me wanna FUKS WIT DA VISION
never thought i would get hyped about some dude opening Pokemon cards in my twentys... damn
nice fake gucci hat m8
toys r us is so overpriced lol fuck. Walmart has the thing you're looking for for about 28 bucks lol
If that hat is real end me.
No Youtube Adpocalypse for Max, considering that Gucci hat and the fact he's in Hawaii.
"Should we get a trolley?"
oh shit max you lost some weight you fat fuck
Part of me would like to imagine that Max always keeps the camera facing his door on, so every time he walks through it's genuinely  just how he walks through his door, and it's never set up.
max you made me moist when you held up those magic boxes
If you open more magic the gathering I'll whip my dick out and rate your video 5 stars on spotify
looking forward to more Magic openings!
nice a 200€ gucci x supreme cap. money well spent.
lol trolly.  ima start saying that instead of cart
"get a trolley"... nigga we at Hawaii not fucking Hogwarts...
You're actually pretty Fucking ugly
Max you played yourself the 20 card things are sh*t
lol nice hat what aare u gay
Pls make a minecraft background.
When you say Islands, Hawaii, and Midway in one sentence
max goes on vacations to buy child's trading cards :)
Nice hat you rich cunt. Keep rubbing it in how rich you are.
fucking open them, cunt.
No Yugioh *SHADOW REALM*/10
his girlfriend must really fucking love him
you look like dezza with that gay hat.
Max is slowly transforming into a peadophile.
those 20 and 1 boxes are shit
That fucking gucci hat :'D
how about some yugioh?
Can't wait for you to open those 20 and 1's. They're garbageeeee
The language tho not cool!
Max looks depressed as fuck. :(
make an MTG channel
Lookin' like the High Voltage album cover today Maxi Pad.
I'm sorry but this is fcking gay like why tf is a grown ass man buying fcking pokemon cards, the gucci hat and hilfiger doesn't fool anyone, your a fcking degenerate
whos that grill
Where the fuck u guys at
Yeah, those foil + 20 cards are trashhhhhhh
If only i wasnt as camera shy id have a better channel haha! When im recording i dunno what too say i go blank
did you get that drew brees pop for your buddy lazer?
In thumbnail you look exactly like the columbine duo even more
5:10 should I be creeped out that his wearing the same pants that my mum has or should I be laughing my ass of 😂😂😂
Bitch, fix your fucking phone, buy another if anything.
what a dapper looking lesbian cunt
Max with that subtle Gucci flex
You can get some of those promos with the coin and random ass other holo here in australia homie, theyre in coles and kmart and shit
POKEMON CARD VLOGS!? mate, you got me a mighty stiffy happenin'
max I work at a big w in Australia and can confirm we do have those promos
Go check your teeth at a dentist M8
I love that Gucci cap, what a shame max looks like a fucking bum wearing it
Wow this guy seems like a fun person to talk to for hours about Pokémon cards.
I saw the thumbnail out of the corner of my eye and for a second I thought "Why am I getting recommended an Onision video?"
ANOTHER FUCKING HOLIDAY MAX
Cunt goes to hawaii to buy pokemon cards.
come to waikiki, rockingham, its better
Is that your mom?
dude why do you have a Pokemon channel your shit with idubz and filthy Frank is practically jackass tier. you're better than this gay shit, have some self respect
if you look up the prices and compare it to what you spent when you open some shit, would you mind linking them?
Don't ever come back on my island again.
Why don't you weigh the mystery boxes? take some scales out shopping. When you get a vintage pack it doesn't count as one of your 5, so you get 6 packs. Should be heavier right?
You look like a typical dutch fuckboy
It would be cool to see you open up Dragon Ball Z cards
you should collect hotwhee ls
"HAWWWAIIII"
What a big fack off ugly gucci cap you got there max!
he seemed drunk
i'm still waiting for uploads on the collection channel

I like 3 times a week
Agree w Nikki to getting the child bearing phase through with! Dads can tend to be overwhelmed by the idea of baby after baby though :-) u guys will figure it out together!
I'm enjoying the three times a week, keep it up guys please don't change it 😊😊
every since Ava started talking I kept wondering is she going to have an Australian Accent
You have great content every time, butI prefer the longer vlogs 2x a week...feels like I get to know you guys better.
Guys every type of vlog is cool. As long as they enjoyable! Xx
I love 2 watch yall 3 times a week.
Nikki does make a valid point with having more children sooner rather then later.  The sleep deprivation will definitely be prolonged the bigger the age gaps... ;)
You guys are entertaining either way. Love your family.
I love watching you guys regularly so please keep it to 3 days a week :) xxx
I like the way it is right now like 3 time a week  💛
I definitely would not be mad if  y'all had another baby. Lol.
I love when the vlogs are creative. Whatever feeds your passion.
I like the shorter vlogs and the creativity is still A-1👌🏾
2 longer vlogs per week :) love watching either way!
Sweater 👀 Nice On You! Avas SO Beautiful!  They grow so fast! Our Son just turned 24 this past Saturday and our Daughter Will Be The BIG 18 In February.
keep it 3 times a week pleeaaassee u guys are a part of my life now
I am used to 2 vlogs no matter the style. Three is just an added bonus honestly. Artsy/long, or vlog short--I appreciate them ALL       really.
I like the three times a week they feel more real !
Enjoyed both styles what ever works for you to create that family balance.
I like the shorter vlogs. The creativity has not been lacking.
haven't watched your videos in a few months wow!! Ava is walking and talking... so cute & exciting. xoxo
shorter vlogs is the best IMO
my older brother works in JD sports in Britain
Have you considered multiday vlogs?Meaning you record over 2 or 3 days and then post the vlog. It's more organic than trying to find interesting things to vlog about every day you vlog imo.
3 times a week. I enjoy watching you guys 😊😊😊 keep up the good job...
Two long vlogs please :)
3 times a week:), and our babies are only 1.5 months apart, and we were not planning to have another, and well SURPRISE we are....Hurry up and get pregnant, so we can be preggers at the same time again lol
I love you guys...make me want to start doing videos but I don't know where to start 😘
Their vlogging equipment totals what $10K? so cool wow
I don't mind either vlog styles. I just loves the vlogs, don't stop vloging
I'd prefer two days a week and more creative content :) It gets a bit repetitive when you watch every one of you videos!
Voting for 3 times a week Vlogs :)
ifni could press the like button 100 times for nikki's slipper i will it was sooo funny 😂😂😂😂 so guys thumbs up so nikki's slipper
lmaaooooooo the slippers
I realy enjoy the 3 time vlogs a week. but if is to much for you guys is ok horever is confort to you. thank you xx
I like the shorter blogs 3xs a week
3 times and short vlogs guys
I think it really doesn't matter... but can you maybe post it around the same time and day each week if possible?  So we can at least know when it'll be up?
2 vlogs a week please
I've been watching you guys so long now that I'm so use to your accents. My big walks by and says why are you watching Australia TV. I was like what are you talking about? 😂😂
What ever makes ya happy is ya channel I will still watch 🙂
I watch these videos, and I smile ear to ear.
I just love you guys. i like both ways in which you guys vlog
I like the 3 videos a week format and I think they're plenty creative! Thanks for all the work you guys do to deliver great content each week 🙂
the short vlogs are nice because they are regular a lot of the time. but the creative vlogs shows the depth of your skills. you can do 3 vlogs per week with one of them being a longer vlog.
Do whatever is best for your family!
I love the 3 vlogs a week. like the sweater. love Ava's baby gibberish. So cute!
I have no problem with the shorter vlogs. as the other user said you can save the longer vlogs for special events. the quality of the videos are the same which is great nothing of a lower quality
3 vids a week!
3 times seems a lot more intimate. Keep up the good work.
I prefer the longer vlogs better its okay if you only upload 2 days, but I agree we get a little more of you guys with those...thanks
Why is Jamie so funny today 😂
I love the 3 vlogs/week. I don't think they're any less creative. I love being able to watch y'all more during the week!
I like the 3 times a week vlog so I get to see Ava more often ☺️
I enjoy the 3 times a week ❤️
I like the 3 videos a week as I am a mom to a newborn and it's easier to watch shorter videos for me. In my opinion your videos are always creative 😊
I am new to your channel but I really enjoyed the video. Thanks for sharing.
Do whats best for you and your family. I love you guys.
3 times a week
Vlog three times a week just longer vlogs if possible
two was nice
I do miss the creative vlogs, but I wouldn't trade that for seeing more of Ava
I like 3 in the week because then I don't have to wait so long to the next vlog
Please have like 10 kids. You guys are too pretty not to.
3 times rocks
Awe Ava is going to school, how did I miss that :-)
What type camera is that, it is so clear.
now that was Hilarious. Ava is adorable 💝💝💝💝
hey ava u such a cute little princes u make us hapy always when watching u and helo niks and jamie the very good parents, tnx ems ching ❤
Nikki I would like for you to do a look book of your clothes and shoes
When Nikki shows the size of the corset and it looks more like the size of my thigh than my waist😅😂
I prefer the 2 long vlog
hey Nikki, Jamie and gorgeous Ava I watch your vlogs and you guys are a beautiful family. I'm South Sundanese I speak Nuer just like you. I'm in high school in year 7. hope you can reply and I love you guys so much  xx
3 times a week, please :)
Nikki is legit soooooo beautiful!
3 times a week!
I like twice a week but really its whatever you guys want to do. Either way I enjoy y'all so much!
She wants her kids 2 years apart...hmmm If she got pregnant now Ava would be two by the time the new baby came. Just saying 😏
Nooooo keep these 3x a week! I don't even mind the change. Just want to see the fam 🙌🏾🙌🏾
I love more vlogs I wish you guys did even more more more... I'm going to watch regardless
For me 3 times a week
does he keep rubbing his right hand on his right thigh..? no matter who you are, if youre in front of live cameras you'll be a lil nervous haha
lebron, can you pay my parking fine that I got in toronto? since you're oferring....
No it Was 666 comments
"spur of the moment"
4:37 when the goat laughs you laugh with him
2:30 - when lebron talks about paying fine (THANK ME LATER)
why isn't he wearing a shirt
Steph curry and the Dubs are coming for yo assss boiii
Lebron, this Billy Bob from I Don't Ball News...tell us, your hairline went away, but made a tremendous come back. Tell us how? Follow up question: Who's holding Stephen A's hairline hostage?
That pinky ring though 🤒
love how takes his sweet time
This nigga Lebron walking into the press conference mad af he couldnt finished that beer XD
"Not much of a beer guy, but if she had red wine I prolly would of taken a sip.. Hehehehe" *no one laughs*
#BEER IS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF (RETRIEVING HAIRLINES) - SO  "BRON-BRON" - PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THE BREWSKIES!!!!!!!
You have to be 21 to drink beer Lebron wears number 23 21+23=44 one fourth of 44 is 11 Klay thompson wears number 11 1+1=2 2+11=13 13x2=26    Boom Warriors Blew a 3-1 lead
ok imma hop on this red wine thing now.. GOAT is doing it so it must be good
That shirt probably cost more than most of you people's wardrobe.
why he eat my niggas French fries 😂😂😂
drill sgt of the cavs by his shirt
they still hate on lebron! 🐐
Nigga looks like he got back from WWII
will the cavs win against boston celtics... isiah thomas is unstoppable
his shirt reminds me of my ex wife, I either love her or hate her!
red wine instead of beer, why am i not surprised
Lebron look like an African Commander
Red WIne!!!!??  Lebron you try to hard bro. Harden's cooking cavalier soup this year.
How does that nigga that less money
Hating BITCH
Do they all have to take a shower together after the game? Or do they have little private, individual showers.  (I know it's a crazy question but....whatever).
his shirt makes me want to do things that im not sure i could do in life
scripted matches usa wake up
and this is news?
all that money and look at that god damn shirt wtf
I hear LeBron but I can't see LeBron...
LeBron dress like he's the lead drummer of a rock band called "The Slicers"
Nigga look like he auditioning to be black panther
that's right, red wine, u tell em. Lebron lol
He just got pressured into paying someone elses huge fine hahaha
that shirt looks like he unlocked a new battle pack from battlefield 4
looks like a gorilla
he never even drank it damn
kingballer23 be real bro so your saying pipen Oakley and theus weren't a helping hand for jordan?come on bro get real
1 year and four months sober for me! Not one sip.
Yo Bron can you pay the rest of my car loan?
Lt.Col. Lebron Raymond James, US. Army Rangers. 1st Batt.
damn hes ugly
2:30 for the Dahntay Jones' Fine comment 4:02 for the Beer Lady Comment  Again, you're welcome.
Its been crazy watching Lebron go from a boy to a man. Dude has changed
why is there a goat being interviewed?
he's such a bitch
Forget the conference I'm just looking at the watch
damn you can't just cut the interview tho...
Attempting?? If he had attempted it he would have done it.
If Cavs can beat  Houston, warriors or Spurs in the finals then I would consider Lebron the greatest player of all time..
Nice shirt...looks like its from his Edi Amin collection....😂😂😂.....great game though....
This f_ng guy !!!
brons intelligent as fuck
The greatest Phony in the business.. Smh.. LeFraud Shames does it again. 👎👎
GOAT GONNA SWEEP WEAK ASS RAPTORS
Have you ever realized that the questions that interviewers ask are actually retarded? No wonder why Pop is always a troll in interviews..
DUCK DYNASTY shirt!!!!  My Man!........LMBAO
6:18 why this man out of breath
Warriors fans/Lebron Haters be like He should be be fined, he's not setting a good example for the youth, boo hoo!
I tried to buy a camaflouge but i can never find them?
CROWN OUR KING
Lame ass James! Go BOSTON!
"i was upset that i had an and one opportunity and i didn't complete" what a fucking goat
Lebron probably would of drank that beer but then he thought about how much he would get fined
that Ally off the backboard though day uuuu um
video starts at 0:00 no need to thank me
His answer at 5:40 was so perfect, this guy is really a media king really believes that everything is for the fans, he's always been well spoken at these press conferences
Where's Lebron?
Why are these people looking at some notes on the table? Have they come with chits? lol
Wtf..... as soon as Jones got ejected I said in my head "I bet Lebron will pay the fine"
smh who watches this horeshit? why force the players to go thru this
Damn it ask this goat why doesn't he do the hands down knees up celebration anymore. That shit was epic after a highlight.
Dear Lebron, why don't you do you celebration anymore? That shit was a king way of celebrating. Bring it back bro.
First rounds on The King! #CaseOfTheMondays
I do not understand these people.  If they play too many games, they complain saying they are tired; however, if they rest 8 days, they complain and say they performed well considering the "8 days lay-off".
I hated LeBron but he cool.  Great game zero flops but he did miss 3 layups in a row but Ibaka says... "IT AIN'T GONNA BE EASY"
Cavs have been winning ever since Tristan got rid of that Kardashian.
Why Bron look like a Nigerian War Chief
6000k is small to LBJ he a real nigga paying that for his teammate once again
He sounds like he should be the GM of the CAVS.
The lameness is strong with this one

Omg that's hilarious😂😂😂😂😂😂 I love you guys!!
Are you noticing the add monetization problem?
I will subscribe to whoever subscribes to me!  (plz don't say no)
What days are vlogs posting? cant remember ive seen a naild schedual :)
Hans is reminding me of Marcus :)
Where's the Rolls Royce?
Hahahaha.. The "no, no, no, no" when Benji wound down the car window and the immediate adjustment of the temperature in the car.. Happens even in the summer in Sweden.
I never laugh a lot but this episode really made me.
Jon, it's time for you to review the Dell and how well performs compared to the MBP 15.
We are Hans an Jon and we are here to ( PUMP YOU UP ) .
Thumbs up so Jon sees this... Someone is taking over Douchebags LOL https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/douchebagofsweden/fancy-schmancy-hoodie-your-new-favourite-hoodie-un?ref=category
Your vlogs are better when your around your family and friends, your brother is funny you should show him more and Riley.
My friend asked what your suitcase was called what the Db meant so I told him an they just laugh thinking I'm lying so please tell them the name and why you named it that please.
Seriously one of my favourite VLOGS!!! Very good job!!!
You need to hang out with your brother more often, Jon. He's funny!
Does anybody know what type of sunglaases haans is wearing ? Thanks
I can't belive Jon is younger than his brother! His brother looks like he's the big brother haha
Vote for Jon's brother in de vlog Permanently!!!
Folks in Sweden are very nice.  Think they are more educated than us Americans.  Many speak a number of different languages too.
Maria is the best ! <3 Jon can you please say hi to Maria from Alja and Matija from Maribor, Slovenia ! Thanks
Love your family!
Ahahahahha when benji said maybe cause the think i tried Klling myself
Ahahahahaj your brother Is a legend
I know you are enjoying your days off from vlogging, but it feels like a lifetime now between your vlogs. :(
What kind of backpack is he wearing?
Ok, Hans is funny.
Loved the music in this episode :)
HOLY SMOKES; YOU FINALLY ANSWERED MY QUESTION ABOUT HAIRWAX!!! but, Im still wondering what hairwax Richard uses :(
What brand are your brothers sunglasses?
Does anyone kno what the red thing is for that Jon is holding at @6:57?
Maaan your parents are awesome!! They seem to have a strong young spirit :)
Tell me Maria didn't just run a line at 10:44?
Its awsome how many Subs you got! I subscribed you when you had 80.000 Subs! At home i got two Db's😍  German Army❤️
Awesome episode! Never seen Jon so relaxed before as the rescue guys were coming. Benji was a little nervous.
Very funny story :)
Jon your brother is the funniest person i saw! Your whole family is amazing!
Amazing vlog as always 😍
Can't wait for more summer vlogs
This should go viral
what were these red things jon had around his neck?
LOL 6:42 walking on the ice sounds like chewing Doritos😂😂😂
honestly just really rinsing your hair is the best thing for it, natural oils keep it nice and strong and shining, doesn't get greasy if you really rinse!
Can someone explain what the red things are for that Jon is wearing on the lake? Are they supposed to help you grab onto the ice or what? I thought they were flares at first.
More Hans on the vlogs please. His character really improves the Vlog.
Poor Hans isn't used to the "V-Log" life!!   He should definitely come to Monaco & Marbella to live large.  Hans + Rickard competing to see who's the real boss player, that would be a whole vlog by itself!!
Your brother is so funny! Need to visit with him more...
Time to invite warner! Even more fun
Reaching new levels of epic, Benjamin *content* Ortaga :D hahaha. (don't kill yourselves though)
love the vlogs Jon! I have a question; will you ever be making more of those signature iphone stick on wallets?? would love to have one!  Keep up the good work!:)
wow man that was a awesome vlog happy to eat my words keep it going :P
His brother is like boosted booris a bit lol
Guys! Is it shoot on GH5?
Explain us the hair thing going on How did u deal with it when you started not shampooing, etc.
One of the funniest vlogs ever. Laughed hard.
haha.. hilarious vlog.. must say JON's younger brother is awesome.. keep up the good work.. god bless
These vlogs are so good now. Damn near should have his own TV show
Come to SAN FRANCISCO - in the last year you have not been to northern california once and I think you would enjoy it a lot. Imagine the shots you could get of the Golden Gate Bridge
hans should start a vlog, please !
Maybe put translated subtitles
I have a question how is your name pronounced really I hear people saying John, jun. is John and nick name?
please Hans, start a vlogging channel!!!
YEA GO TO SAUNA WORLD NEAR THE RESORT
Can i binge watch this on Netflix?
Too funny! Darn kids playing on the ice...
"2 kids on the ice"... And Jon is 36
8:56 You can really see the guilty feeling on Jon's face 😁👍🏼
What are those slippers you had on outside?
it doesnt cost anything??? ..ouh wow ...😅👍 thumbs up for sweden
The world needs to be more like Sweden!
Watching ads all the way through in honor of Hans
Just curious what was that red skip rope looking thing they brought onto the lake? Whistle of some sort?
Jon Olsson family time, so funny 😂 👍🏽 #stayhumblejon
The past few vlogs have been so funny. Well done!
Your brother is so damn funny, that haircut montage had me cracking up!
Jon your family is amazing!!! Such a treat to watch! I don't have a family so seeing yours is beautiful!
Loving the fam. ! Feel better Jon !!!
OK Ive been watching for a while now, i have to say this is my best and fav episode...spending time with fam and getting busted at the lake so original and awkward...cheers from HouTx
Please put subtitles when you don't speak English. ☺
"The v-log life." -- Hans Olsson  The whole family is great.
Also, Jons brother reminds me of Jason Segal. He needs to move to Hollywood, he is hilarious!
Kids in Africa would eat those screw
Fuk iPhone I run Android and my battery lasts fo
yeah people love iPhone because of this? Luxury on face has dark stories
Watching on an iPhone 7
Same things happen in IT industries in india I dont think we need modernisation if we are struggling for living to get wealthy modernised.  Life really sucks in this 20th century
It's hard not to screw up!
well the cages are probably not to prevent suicide but to keep the genuine apple parts in the factory..
That explains why so may iPhones I've bought brand new don't work. These are people, not machines.
that is absolute torture I wonder how much money Apple paid to Chinese government to carry on with this slavery
This is why I buy Android
How the fuck does face recognition work when they all looks the same?!
Ohhh. So this is why we created assembly lines with machines instead of people.
Thanks to iPhone users who screwed up China people's living.
Uhh... Dude... Why I Cant See The BLUE SKY And SUN?
And there are people who want a socialist revolution in America 😂😂 they have no idea what capitalism does for them over here
Wow, that's terrible.... man I thought they would've at least given them one of the older gen phones for free...
So I am the only one here thinking it is not that bad
I don't like this....
Thank you for posting this and going undercover.  It is so terrible that people must sacrifice being with their families or even having a relaxing life.  The whole set up is criminal.
2:52 fucking noob cho gath thinks he can 1 v 1 tower 9x report pls!!!!
why don't they use robots instead..!?
I thought iphones were made in America.
this is what trump is fighting against
they would do it beacause free room and over stuff
if only they worked on preventing the cause of suicides rather than just stopping the act itself.
Fantastic insight
A 32GB iPhone 7 does not cost more than $230 to produce, assembling the whole thing costs Apple only $5 for each phone, Apple sells you products at more than double the price it actually costed them
would you work at my sweatshop?
Im watching this on my IPhone :(
Fuck Apple ill never spend that amount of money on a phone or any other product
that is slavery, not work.
I love my job, so much that  i would die for it. -``Every CrApple iPhone worker,,
Apple products should be cheap af, if this is what workers get paid & endure, but instead they're expensive
Worst kind of Undercover boss episode
1.37 they have face recognition 😯
How bout apple invest some of that fuckton of extra money we pay in getting robots to automate shit
Keep buying your slave made NSA spy gadgets, you fucking morons. I'm especially talking to you "social justice" liberals, LOL. Go back to your do nothing make nothing office jobs . .
I'm watched this video on my 6s plus!
pink shirt?
Watching this on an Android. Got to say feel proud.
and school didn't even taught u about putting a screw
wat he did in NYU?
Quit complaining and make my phone.
I watched this on my IPhone
Now I'm wondering how the iPad I'm watching this on was made
less than $2 an hour  "Steve Jobs is a hero"
the fact that he mentions suicide preventing measures around the factory so casually disturbs me beyond belief
I live in Mexico. A full time job at an Office Depot, repairing computers, pays less than 400 per month. Believe me.
How do you use facial recognition with these people?
Who's watching this on an IPhone
Sounds like every other job that based in a factory, apart from the dorms part.
Modern day slavery This asshole is downplaying what's really going on.
And people cry over not getting the right colour or not getting the most recent Iphone. Send this to them.
That's not bad if you ask me.
So, in addition to the HR dept, they also have a "Suicide Prevention Dept."....wow, fancy!
So vegetarians will be avoiding meat cuz Animal Cruelty but it's okay for some guy to work till his fingers bleed in China just so they can get the new iPhone ..... hypocrisy
That has to be some pretty advanced face recognition hardware...
That's China, baby.
Better than coal miners
In a few years there will be no more jobs like this -> robots.
Slow down, why was League of Legends thanked at the end of the video?
That's why they are reluctant to move their factories back to US.
That's communism for you
So just like America. Go figure.
Would rather die than do that.
TBH its not like they are being forced to work there
Watching this on my 3ds. Nintendo is japanese
why would people do suicide?
Image working there but owning an android for a phone.
Aren't they made in california?
This is what americanize economic brings, pain suffering, exploitation and a highway to the fat faces of their own people.
1 bathroom for 200 people? Like what?? What happens if there are 99 people who need to go urgently to the toilet and u are the last one, damn your bowels gonna explode! SMDH china at its finest!
This is messed up
Disgusting. Apple can NOT justify charging nearly £1000 for a phone
AI will sort this out, once and for all. Thank Fuck
"Sources:League of Legends" ? xD
Damn I get 5 times more money than you per month and I failed my exams in school lol

This Legend
that was awesome
lol he suck
The man sipping his wine at around 4:20-4:21 minutes (yes I see the reference too) could not take that sip, if he were to, the wine would be all over the table.   Hassan. Brillent!
*"Journalists*  *ISIS* *Normal length tie"*

Unfunny libtard curry eater
AND THIS EMIGRANTE GOT NO RESPECT AT ALL FOR THE FAKE NEWS!!!! ACKNOLEGING THAT DONALD THE BOSS WAS RIGTH!!!!!
!!!!ALLL LIES!!! donald t5he man!!!! IS NOT ON !!! BECAUSE ALL THE FAKE!!!! NEWS!!! WERE INVITED!!!!!! AND NOT ALECS JONES OR FOXY NIUS!!!!
why are there so many dislikes? this is hilarious
Wow this crowd needs more sense of humor.
Remember you are a Minority
NAZI NAZI NAZI
I didn't find him funny.
talentless jokes only turned out to be mean.
Half that crowd either has no sense of humor or their arseholes are so puckered up,  their throats have closed... the dude completely killed it... blew the roof off and deserved a better crowd.
Irrespective of your political sympathies, this guy really sucks. His energy is annoying and all he can handle are low hanging fruit-jokes. Some finesse/comical should be warranted if you're doing this gig.
this was pathetic
10/10 for Hasan Minhaj.
Of course they had to use a Muslim "comedian" to affirm their support of Sharia in America. These are sick hated filled rage filled self loathing people with a death wish.
,,Okay, enough about House Slytherin." LOL
THE WHOLE AUDIENCE WAS TRIGGERED
This is great, lol.
Call of Duty sounds like fun
I always wondered how differently these speeches might come off if they were delivered to a room of normal people as opposed to a bunch of lizards in suits.
Why can't these people laugh?
Hes not that funny
In the not-funny tradition of Seth Meyers.
Muslims ass on fire
Look at those bastards laugh, as if governing a country is a joke. Im glad im not American, a joke, that is...
How sad is it when a comedian speaks more truth than an entire presidential administration? Great job Hasan!
okay- we get it. you're brown and you don't like trump, what a revolutionary stance that is to take! what bravery you must have!
is this guy suppose to be funny? or is he pretending to be a guy who is pretending to be a comedian
Too white a crowd and they are too stiff! Butt hurt at a brown man cracking 'em up. Calling Chris ......
its nice that everyone enjoying there
I did nazi that nazi joke comming;)
he is so cleverly funny!
when he roasted fox news!!😂😂
omg I am still cracking the fuck up! This man deserves the man of the year award for this one!! will go down in history! He said alot of things about Trump that are so true!😂😂😂😂😂😂
10:05 that guy is dead inside
Is this guy a comedian?    He talks like a Muslim!
''Immigrants - we get the job done.''
he roasted call of duty I am done
That whole fucking speech was GOLDEN, but the last few minutes are fucking cocaine, jesus that was a lit ending
Woah I hope we get good speeches like this at next year's correspondents' dinner xD
fuck you  global
fucking greasy looking  guy. even while in a 3k suit
hahahahaha in your face you non Muslims in your face ... MUSLIMS FUCKING RULES ..FUCK U NON MUSLIMS
Sick burns xD
fucking terrorist
this guy is awesome and hilarious.  oh and he's honest
i would loooove to see just shots of the audience the whole time! Snowflakes melting is Beautiful to me.
Completely Sober...... I called it butt dialing and can't remember a word...
This is more proof that American Elitists do not believe in democracy.  It also proves there are lots of ass-holes eager to sell out their souls for fame.  The sad little c----
What kind of a triggered right wing faggot would give this a thumb down?!
This was amazing. Classic
god bless the great ol usa!!
This is more of a comedy central roast HAHAHA
I'm now a fan of this guy
classic!!!!!!!!
5:07 R-Kelly hanging at the correspondents' dinner. I see you.
The last comment was unexpectedly savage. "I'd like to thank Woodward and Bernstein for inspiring a generation of journalists... and I'd like to thank Donald Trump for inspiring the next."
I'm gonna call this guy Token. Token is one of the few reel good Arabs, generally Hollywood prefers reel bad Arabs.
What is Comedy Central? An internship for Netflix 🤣🤣🤣
Very boring. Ive heard the same type jokes for the last year and half...
deport that sand nigger
His clothes look small?
this is so good
Surprise, surprise. The lying, thin skinned, orange, pussy grabber couldn't take being roasted like the pig he his.
The constipated looks on all of these privileged faces are a bit painful to watch. Laugh - he is freaking funny even if Rome is burning.
the moment you realize the jokes are facts...
Snap, who is that lady at 7:07?  Hot..........  And no, I'm not talking about the two fat chicks.
That pink lady at the back @20:59 looks like hilary clinton lol
College campuses only have free speech if you are a liberal.
Watching Wolf Blitzer crack up at Papa Minhaj returning used underwear to Costco ... he knows his secret is out now
Fuck those filthy muslims
Well said... dump the chump! #resist!!!!!!!
Notice how when CNN talked about him, they only played clips of him roasting Trump and commented how funny it was. They were silent in talking about his visceral attacks on CNN and all the other media hacks...
Back of the room against the wall at 20:58. Looks like Hillary.
I love all that he did and said they needed to hear all that shit
Give the man a medal! Amazingly good! Exactly what EVERYONE is thinking!
omg words cant explain how much ily guys #CNCOWNERS
What the fuck is this trash 😂
I came here because the song was trending idk if people are leaving english comments but so far I am so happy to see a Mexican Boy Band :D <3

Wtf is this Mexican trash, why is YouTube promoting this shit garbage?
Erick Te Amooooo.
The kings👑🔝
I don't even speak whatever language it is.. I think it's spanish.. But still loved it
Wtf is this..
I can t understand anything from comments / I liked the song
One of their videos have 600m views and they are "Artist on the rise " ? Lol , they seem pretty successful
this gave me cancer, mexicans trying to be cool lmao.
This is gayy too
Is this the Justin Bieber of the Spanish region ?
Now this is what u call an EPIC FAIL.
The smart guy at 0:27 hits the ship balcony in front of him instead of pirates
it sucks, because they have starving families and are forced to do this.
Cool video and all but don't you "trained" forces understand that the crosshair is a bit higher from the barrel?!
Kill Them Vermin Rats.
wonder if he got his 72 virgins?
fishing raison
fuckin plebs with m4s with no scopes shootign ppl from 300m away ffs
holy shit habib we might want to rethink this pirate thing
It was a prank bro 😂
Caption should've said "ancient monkeys from continent of Africa meet new albino monkeys with tools."
SOMALIS ARE PRAVERS. THEY DON'T FEAR
0:25 WHY IS HE SHOOTING HIS OWN BOAT?????
Stupid niggers
They need some aim points on those. Maybe a 1-4X optic.
these guys are coward, they are shouting at the guards of Indian ocean are coming
Anyone else notice the first few shots hit their own ship rail?
Were they even Somali pirates? And what if they were some survivers coming for help. Jeez they just started shooting lol
where is RPG?
That accuracy though😂😂
What a professional security guard hitting the fence
LOOK AT ME..... IM THE CAPTAIN NOW!
What you need is a point 5 belt fed machine gun !!
This reminds me of that episode of South Park! Reply if you know which one I'm talking about lol.
Knocked those fuckers back to the Stone Age.... did not have far too go.
grrrhh *Counter terrorists win* grrrhh
What if they just wanted to sell some fruit?
Still better than all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies
I am Somali pirate, and I will fuck if any any country dares  to attack my people bitches.😎🇸🇴
Nice job killing the rail.
thaTS INSANE!  THOSE DUDES ARE DEAD
I wouldn't be able to shoot these sea monkeys .... BECAUSE I'D BE LAUGHING TOO HARD TO AIM!
They would be better off swarming them with multiple boats at once.
The guy at the lower level        Reported, coz look at dat aimlock
Did they drop any loot?
Oops that was the pizza delivery ...
damnnnn, better than the last transformers movie!
They let them get in nice and close.
was the guy in the beginning trying to wallbang the boat through the wall he was hiding behind?
so this is murrder on yt.
You have to be an absolute nigger for not understanding what ur doin
Last seconds of the video sounded like the start of a rap, bullets as beat and someone rapping when speaking to his radio lmao
PULL OVAH TATATATATAT!!!
Counter Terrorist win
beautiful just beautiful... I actually fapped to this
thats trident group
where are my Somali people
Marine life was killed during the filming
Maybe in America.
Wonder what would happen if the "Pirates" where just an uncle and his son in a rowboat fishing.
Let's play battlefield
A couple miniguns would've done a better job.
My question is how the fuck do they get on after ramming the side? Throw a rope over?
Looks like fun
Prior planning
KILL the nigga shitttt !!!!!!
SINK THAT BOAT!
fucking kaffirs primitive as hell
This is horrifying
0:26 and on - are those scraps made by the security fire? holy pogo stick!
i wish siege had a map like this
Better equip the ship with 16-inch guns and blow them up with a single shot.
"My name is Aaden Abdirahim... and this is jackass!"
Whoa! Stop shooting guys! It's just a prank! Look theres the camera!
"How Captain Phillips should have ended"
Should just hit em
why dont you guys dont wait for the second boat t get closer? it would be nice to smoke them too
enemy spotted! *radio sound*
top ten overpowered anime heros
Got what they deserved, good riddance pirates
warning shots! *wink wink*

The High Roller is so cool. I used to live in Vegas, so cool to see.

Who would ride a wooden roller coaster. I rode one  and it was scary. You can feel the wood swaying when you ride! :0
We have the ride Hercules in Ireland and its a bit higher than the one you said replaced the other one check it out it is in Tayto Park in Leinster
The accident on number 2 actually happened in 2007
You tell me so much that I think that you are the coolest YouTuber ever
Dolly Wood has a wooden roller coster
I think that when ever Japan ever makes a rollercoaster they always get bad luck it leads to death bones Brocken or death again
I bet that I will get only 5 likes
I would totally ride the hercules!
My favourite rollercoaster was number 4 they all look amazing though
hey whats up your great
I like number 5 I wish I could've rode it

Simon was Reaccomodated In Peace. Check this out:  https://www.facebook.com/JobergChannel/photos/a.798098330354384.1073741829.768102196687331/808205116010372/?type=3&theater
Bunny was cremated without permission, sounds like someone had something to hide, perhaps the rumor of it being placed in a freezer for 16 hrs may carry some weight after all. Will never know now!
Lawsuit they killed him
New cabin sign in United planes will read. Be vewy quiet.  We're fweezing giant wabbit.
The rabbit was forced to vacate the warm area it was in and go to the freezing area because a bunny owned by an A-list celebrity or somebody more important wanted that space. maybe it was a bunny with more miles.
I hope united airlines get sued
Bunny lives matter
theres no oxogen in the plane or air and gets very hot in there
...At United Airlines, we don't beat the competition, we beat you and kill your pet!!...
k...maybe united-continental has got heat for over arrogant industry...I"ll finish statement when sober up & not old and bitter   when does the universe recycle again?
poor bunny thanks to human animals as always
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH !!!
So united airlines just killin anything that moves at this point?
The ground crew mistook the rabbit for a guitar - the rest you know... -- Bob
hmmm... a check up 3 hours before... fit as a fiddle... I wonder what could have killed a small prey animal after being put on a commercial airline in the cargo section. puzzling
what happens to it now? so good meat. dont throw it away.
So if they treat people like crap, what makes you think that they will treat an animal right. Lol makes sense to me!!!!!!
the rabbit was seen sitting on a flight attendants chair, hence they had no other choice but no chuck the greedy fucker out of the plane.
United need to be shut the fuck down.
His owners should be charged with a cruelty offence  for leaving Simon in the hands of United , a few people ought to smarten up and stay away from the airline .
Divided we stand. UNITED we fall.
Oh man, I'm SURE it was those evil satanist Conservative pigs who LET THE POOR BUNNY DIE  BLACK LIVES MATTER
#RABBITLIVESMATTER
Now they killed that poor bunny....smh.😔😞🐰
Is the rabbit asian?
Because the flight was overbooked? Again?
Gaddarm United is catching more Ls than soldier boy
Airline killed that poor bunny.
so they killing anything that moves huh?
the rabbit was sitting in its cage when it was told it had to leave because a pilot needed that cage instead.
Rabbits die everyday B. (While munching on chips) - Camron
Its a fucking rabbit... like come on now... i used to eat them back in the days... and now you all butthurt over some tasty rabbit... smh....
*_We need a congressional hearing!!!!!! United is a rough airline!!!!!!_*
The RABBIT died on the way to O'HARE..... I'm sorry. I had to say it.
The RABBIT died on the way to O'HARE..... I'm sorry. I had to say it.
Did ellen just mentioned a "disturbed" song right there?
I cringe every time the female narrator talks. Idk if it's a shitty script or her shitty delivery but it's awful.
"Isn't the rise of Zombies just an allegory for the rise of consumerism​ in the earlier 20 century America?"   *I would like to ask for your hand in marriage Ellen*
REVOLUTION MURCA
i love That girl 😘
There is also the zombie island DLC for Borderlands.
If you want to look at games that lose the plot look at the story and characters in the Bio Shock 1 and 2 they are nuts especially when they have not seen natural light or land for so long.
I mean, orcas are pretty bloodthirsty hunters and killers. I wouldn't count them out as a murderer.
You guys should do 'times dlc were better than the core content'. CoD BO3 multiplayer should be on that list somewhere, or as honorable mention.
How did you miss the Sleeping Dogs DLC which introduced Hopping Vampires and Ghosts? Or the Alan Wake DLC The Writer.
What about tiny Tina dlc for borderlands  I know that it's about Tina dealing with losing Roland Butt it's all about magic and shiz and breaks the 4th wall  Not about being a vault hunter on another planet
even though it's separate from the game far cry 3 blood dragon threw away everything about far cry 3 for a cyber-80s style awesome game lol
Andy's SRW shirt tho 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hey how about that time in Bioshock DLC that you were the daughter, wait, the little girl, no wait the REAL villain, no...
My plans for Geo Orbital Kinetic Actuating  Resonance Transceiver now have a name. Operation GO KART is a go
I thought Undead Nightmare was pretty fucking cool.
wait! why does everyone hate Conner? He wasn't that bad of an assassin was he?
I'd throw the Tiny Tina DLC from Borderlands 2 in here.   I mean, sure there's a maniac with a fake face running around trying to end the world for the sake of Capitalism or whatever but... I mean... D&D right?
Exactly how many annoying children work at the Outside offices anyway?  Every single video seems to have a completely separate set of about 5 presenters.   WTF?
I thought Hamilton was Washington's right hand man
bad joke's are the funniest
No mention of Far Cry 3 and  Blood Dragon? That was a pretty drastic change.
SOUTHPAW REGIONAL WRESTLING! LANCE CATAMARAN SHOULD BE ON THIS SHOW!!
Fire Emblem Fates: Beach Brawl. It literaly breaks the story, regarless of choices, and has your siblings fight for a ticket to the beach that you apparently won in some lotery
Anyone else think of Carl Azuz with the Orca puns? No? Just me? Okay...
Soooo wait. Are we not talking about Blood Dragon?
In fairness, Arma's Karts are quite epic for the multiplayer servers, nothing like when someone panics driving one right into a tree, sign, rock, anything that'll end them lol
The good-John wearing the duster coat The bad-John wearing a bandana The ugly-Seth
But I LOVED defending an Orca in court.
When you like outside extra more than outside xbox
I can't believe you didn't mention that the aliens have been watching Fallout's Earth for centuries, and you end up exploring the ship with a cowboy and a samurai, and other assorted time-displaced weirdos.
I never beat tyranny of king Washington because a glitch wouldn't let me advance the story and boobysoft decided to say fuck you to everyone and not patch it.
Wait.. does this mean that Ellen advocates shooting those plagued with consumerism in the head?
i thought Hamilton became Washingtons' right hand man
I don't even have an xbox and i still watch outside xtra lmao
What about Bloodborne? In one moment you have to stop the world from ending in a night, the other you are sucked into a dimension to fight fish-people while trying to discover some secret you never fully understand...
Asura's Wrath: The Lost Episodes should be here on the list.
it may be an older game but Elders scrolls 4 Oblivion: The shivering isle expansion,  common it's Sheogorath
I expected the "jack the ripper" dlc in syndicate to be on this
Sick Southpaw Regional Wrestling t-shirt
How have I never heard of the fallout 3 dlc?!
why does that tyranny of washington dlc feel like a fable 3 knock off?
I'm pretty the american revolution was just an excuse for people to throw a piss tantrum over the price of tea
Southpaw Regional Wrestling. Nough said.
Jacks 55th birthday and Ethan must die are not canon. That makes them change the story by nothing. RE7 being on here is invalid!
Psh. The best horse of the apocalypse is definitely horsen wells.
THE FREAKIN' ORCA!! THE MUSTACHE!!! I AM WHEEZING XDXDXDXDXD
good lord i did not know about the Resident Evil one that is hysterical XD
HORSE ARMOR!!!!!
I was going to make a comment about zombies attacking the japanese mafia but got really hung up trying to figure out who would serve alcohol at a 5 year olds birthday party..
The humour is so horribly forced in Outside Xbox videos.
Phobia of probing? Don't you mean...probia?
What about the Sniper Elite 3 zombie, game, thing
Democratic? washington was indipendent but mostly conservative?
what the heck was the arma 3 entry
okay, the dlc to fallout three doesn't actually go against anything canon...so i don't see how it could be considered to have lost the plot
How about the original Red Alert (95) giant ant missions in the Counterstrike Expansion? Giant, mutated ants being fought with Tesla troops and Mammoth tanks?
Does anyone know the name of the song they used in the background in the assassin's creed 3 part of the video
Lol, I see your southpaw regional wrestling t-shirt
Star Wars: The Force Unleashed 2 Endor DLC. You go after and kill all the hero's from the original trilogy. That shit was hard to play.
The sad thing is that the vanilla game for Assassin's creed 3 somehow manages to be more historically inaccurate than the DLC.
What is game in the thumbnail?
Far Cry Blood Dragon?
Someone mentioned Tiny Tina's DLC from Borderlands 2, and I second that.  Also, the Citadel DLC from ME3, where you deal with a clone of Shepard, and how "I should go" sounds to your squadmates.
What about that last bit of DLC for The Evil Within? I thought it was supposed to be survival horror, so why are we that safe-head with a large spiky mallet, crushing random monsters?
say what you want about Connor, bu he helped me pass my US history exam (why do I even have US history, I live in England!)
in the red dead dlc i was so scared of the bigfoots
i like outside xbox more
I find their jokes and acting kinda cringey but i love it
How about a 6 times when you're praying JUST DIE ALREADY
Luke was having a WHALE of a time...
when i found out tyranny of washington was episodic paid dlc after i bought first episode it made me boycott ubisoft and i havent played or purchased a ubisoft game since
What about Sleeping Dogs' Nightmare on Northpoint?  Also, I suppose, The Zodiac Tournament, to a lesser extent, but at least that sort of fit with the whole kung fu thing.
your stupid fucking jokes made you hate all these games. dear god
The addition of Undead Nightmare doesn't seem valid. It's a DLC that doesn't affect the main game in any way. It hasn't lost the plot, because it never pretended to be about the plot, it is *its own plot*
Outside Extra should only be Ellen
where is payday 2
*Dude, what would I do in Kavala without my go kart though?*
I know you only do 1 per series, but but how did zeta beat big MT?
inFamous: Festival of blood
skyrim remastered, the mods
11:22 Tfw your games aliens are voiced by the Great Cornholio himself
She did the community a favor. Give her a medal and a new car.
They got a supermodel as a news anchor jesus christ
only 5 years? thats not fair. she should serve 100 each.
Would she have been high they would blame it on weed. illegalize alcohol
Rich white people ain't sorry but they sure can act...
"...DOUBLE the legal limit!!!!" Otherwise known as "two beers". Also, where did they get those photos of the deceased? mugshots.com?
what would happen if a black guy drove drunk and killed two little white girls?
An eye for an eye law here would be the best option.
Mug shots? 5 years? Jesus fucking christ. What were CBS miami and that Judge thinking?
sounds about white
Why she cryin'? She knew what she did was wrong, if she was truly sorry she wouldn't have driven drunk, simple as that.
If this was a black person killing 2 whites then they would be on death row.
Oh it's fine. It's just a rich white girl killing two niggers. Give her five years to keep the monkeys happy and she'll get out in one when everybody forgets about it. This system is fucking FUCKED.
2 less baboons in this world
Wait, five years for killing two people? The justice system should be bloody ashamed of itself. Disgusting.
JUST IN: FRAGILE WHITE WOMAN ACCIDENTALLY AND UNINTENTIONALLY KILLS 2 POTENTIAL CRIMINALS - GETS OUTRAGEOUS 5 YEAR SENTENCE!  - Modern america
only a few years? how am I not surprised...
If she were a cop, she'd be promoted and the two dudes she killed would have been charged with resisting arrest.
FUCK CBS MIAMI FOR USING MUG SHOTS, i need to go to miami apparently you can kill 2 people and barely get any years
+CBS Miami Hey fuckwits... use actual photos, instead of mugshots, will ya?
Double Vehicular Manslaughter and only 5 years. Becaise shes a degenerate AkA A WOMAN
CBS Miami you should be ASHAMED
wow just 5 years!??!!?! i know a  kid who got 8 years for selling weed. what a fucking joke. #whiteprivilege
Look at how huge her hands are.
She ran over niggers at night imao (You know how hard it is to see niggers at night?) and got 5 years?! SHE RAN OVER 2 ANIMALS AND GETS 5 YEARS IN JAIL WTF
deserved at least 15 years.  human life is worth more than that
AHAHAHAHA I love how BOTH the black victims had been arrested. LOLOLOLOL
Fuck this news station! racist mothafuckers. And....damn 5 years only....shiiiiet
women get lesser sentences because our justice system is a pathetic cuckolding institution
Dem crocodile tears doh...
More female privilege on display for all to see.
its because she's white..
her perfomance wasnt genuine at all.
Pictures taken from Broward Sheriff's Office LOL!
Felt bad til I saw the victims..
10 Years would be Reasonable minimum
please get raped and die please get raped and die  please get raped and die
Reminds me of The Onions "Judge Rules White Girl Will Be Tried As Black Adult"
Stuff like this is why I wish I had the pussy pass
This isn't justice
Equality at its finest, nice.mugshots CBS!
She killed 2 people who had MUGSHOTS which means they were criminals at one point. I feel bad, but much less so now.
Life Pro Tip:  Be white, female and pretty.  Rich and young can't hurt either.
5 years for killing 2 people. Only in the land of the free Muriiicaaa
woman and drunk? that too behind wheels? damn...
the girl is the true victim in this. those two dead black males cause her grief and heartache by not getting out of her way. end the patriarchy.
5 fucking years for taking 2 lifes are you fucking kidding me just cause she have pussy its a fucking disgrace
She's a waste of space. 5 years is a slap on the wrist and she will learn nothing.
Fucking scum.
cough *EQUALITY*
Honestly, maybe she couldn't see them at night...being that they are black...and the night is black...you know? They blended in. I would have killed them sober i believe.
muh vagina!
LOL Both of them had mugshots at the police station already booked HAHA Karma?
fucking disgusting America, why do all of these people have to be visible to everyone? Do American citizens do not have the right to privacy?  0.17 was the alcohol level in her blood, that's 1-2 glasses MAX.
I'm okay with this.
If it was a drunk black man who ran over two young white girls, life without parole, baby!!!!
@Stuart Mills Are you 4?
kill 2 people, cry a little get 5 years. i wish i had a vagina
fuck this she should of got fucked.
A male would have got 20 or more. This is what feminists think "Equality" is.
It is useless to cry over split milk
fuck CBC cracker backed journalism
This is what we call a pussy pass. If she had a dick there is no way in HELL she would have only gotten 5 years.
is it bad that my sympathy for her diminished when I found out she did it in a porsche
ITS COOL BABY IM SURE ITS JUST LIKE ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK AT LEAST YOURE HOT
5 years for killing 2 people while driving drunk?  Oh, it's a female.  That poor poor girl.   /s
Mug shots haha... They should have let her go and given her a raise. Wonder what these two gangster thugs did in their past.
Rich, white, and not ugly, obviously did not mean to kill those two criminals. /s  America's privilege criminal system.
Only 5 years?! America justice system is utterly broken.
she killed 2 men and only gets 5 years? i bet if she was a black male she'd get 20 years..
I have no sympathy for her, maybe if we're lucky she'll die in prison
mba with felony vehicular ma slaughter charge. do you want to manage the McDonald's or burger king?
Those tears are for her fear of her own life being fucked, not sympathy for the victims.
They look like fucking crack heads, she shouldn't have been given any jail time. This is ridiculous, white lives matter.
Isis attackers should just get drunk before going on a rampage then. That way only get 5 years
I think she is remorseful and she means it.  Let's hope she gets minimum security prison.  You know, the ones where its like your own prison apartment with a kitchen.  She deserves a kitchen.
She probably did society a favour.
Imagine she was black
She will serve 2 years in a minimum security Honor camp very rarely does anyone serve the first number of a sentence.
she needs to be publicly put to death
now see, her main problem was not being filthy rich. without being rich one can't suffer from affluenza and thus get off with probation for killing people while drunk
If she were male it would have been 20 years. #pussypass

We british have the ability to produce tea at any given moment.
What rank is he?
typical Americans...giving it the gig 'un as usual !
Rape,rape and still rape. Nothing has changed.
it's the same as today... stupid Americans coming to the UK...
Much as I hate being that guy, I still can't help but notice.  27:20  There's a flicker in his eyes that says something along the lines of "Keep blowing smoke, Honkey."
GO COMPAREEEEE!
Burgess Meredith always looked like an old man, even when he was young. I feel like he's about to shout "you lousy bum!" at me at any minute.
Would you like an American cigarette ?   lol
Are you telling me the UK was more tolerant and junk in the 40's compared to the US of TODAY?!!! Bloody 'ell!
Square that piss cutter..shit
32:46 was his audition to become the penguin
Should show this to the English football fans.
Hey you Negro soldiers, you get to die along side white guys. Ain't you lucky. That was pretty awkward. And the Penguin, with the cigarette holder, Deja Vu!
Old English life, now getting replaced with mosques, mass 3rd world immigration, rape and murder.
I'm English and even I don't understand the old currency, God help those poor Americans who had to put up with it
Well done Burgess,quite a talented man...hate warm beer...
So it is true the British drink tea nonstop
the bit where he smokes in bed took me back to batman's penguin
25:24 dont invite the negro to your house.  lol, he doesnt say its wrong, he simply says it happens here.   Shit still the same today
For a moment I had to remind myself that in the 40s keeping African Americans men and white men separate was considered the norm at the time it goes to show how much has changed in 50 years
horrible ending considering the carnage that took place on D-Day
For anyone visiting the uk today it's not a good idea to stand outside a school and offer the kids candy lol
These old film are so charming, they really don't make them like they use to. I kinda wish Britain was still like it was back then. Without all the sexism and stuff.
We Americans love the English. Total respect between us.
Too bad education isn't like this today!
Wow, burgess merideth as a young man!
How to behave in Britain? Pretend you're Canadian.
Such a great feeling after watching this at 33:33 it like todays army
Shout out to Bob Hope.
That first Yank in the pub would have been taking his teeth home in a bag
Can't wait to see what they whip up for WW3's training video.
25:20 when 40s England was more progressive than USA....oh wait, it always has been. haha
Look at that - he had the Penguin cigarette holder way back in the 40's! At the one shot where he grins with it between his teeth - I thought he was going to go "Waak -Waak - waak! Total coolness!
Keep your small hands to yourselves Yankee Pussy Grabbers!
yanks could learn something from this
I would love to see an older UK military film of how to behave in the US if they ever made one.
Great little social commentary, warms the heart.
Micky?is that you?
Wow that was really interesting
Aberystwyth was the capital of Wales back then?
That bloke is Burgess Meredith the actor who played Rocky's trainer.
I love this kinda videos it's so great
0:26 I just realized that was the ww1 song "Over there"
Go Compare!
Great video

This is one of the few songs I liked from their new album.
Whats the point of pictures if you cant see the whole picture?
Person: I prefer the old Gorrilaz       Me: I prefer T H E B A F F
can you do the tv thing on Netflix or maybe do it on youtube
This was a bonus track over that shitty song "Sex Murder Party"
I would give this T H E B A T H
absolutely one of the best track of this album... i can't  figure why a b-side track. I don't remember what, but sounds like a chet faker' song
The comments section of any of these new songs are cringey as fuck, full of autists that think We Got The Power is actually a good song.
this i why i dont regret buying bassheavy headphones
oh damn I'm feelin this shit
how can Anthony "the meme" Fantano dislike this track...
GUYSSS Who is this Don Thrilla everyone seems to be talking about??? What does he do
already reached the point of no return, my soul keeps getting darker but I damn love it.
2:23 "Imma sleep in the boat"
this shit lit and I knew it was Rag n Bone Man!
those water sounds are annoying, when i hear them i cant help but imagine a guy constipated taking a shit
Momentz we have to cherish man
Right before i watched video i got a gorillaz ad  With noodle in it only her
GORILLAZ DE VOLTA FINALMENTE
it's cold cold cold, i'm a mirrorrr...
This is. I.  Imma go die Because I just died in this song because it's fire
Best song on the album, that also isn't really on the album
The Gorillaz never made a song with Michael Jackson
This shit on repeat! <3
the "it's cold" part sounds so familiar
the gorillaz is so shit.
jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee j j j j j j j j j  go go goRILLLAAAAZZZZ
Congrats on 2 million!!!!
this isnt gorillaz its actually Rag‘n’Bone Man, Zebra Katz & RAY BLK feat. damon ish~
Why isn't 2-D wearing glasses?
this song is so smooth and sensual,  it's just so addictive
Murdock reminds me of the Gallagher brothers circa 1990s
You should just freak with meeee, and let the numbers... rolllllll
You guys are the best love all your songs
Ave Maria like you video
this is fucking amazing
I am an brazilian Guy and this song is soo amazing, i love it (Sorry for my english :/)
Rag'n' Bone Man has SUCH a smooth voice
I have found my new obsession
this is my favorite song right now!!! cant wait to see at Fuji Rock ;-)
Congrats on 2 million subscribers!!!!!
I AM A RIVER
GORRILAZ ARE BACK
2 millones wau
the fact that this has dislikes triggers me
Notice how they labeled these the official audio and not the music videos, leaving them with the ability to make music videos contributing to the storyline.
this should've been in the album
congrats on 2 million subscribers!
This is not Gorillaz
Can't believe y'all just passed 2,000,000 subs!! Congrats. (Also, this track is pure fire)
Cold, cold, cold *sweet 2D's voice*
1.25 speed, you're welcome.
funny how rag n bone man has a song called "human" and now he's singing on an album called "humanz" lol
Thiz song is melted butta for tha earholez.
I just bought my CD but I don't have CD player sooo... here I'am ;)
I wish this creative
I instantly recognized Rag'n'Bone man  Isn't a coincidence that Gorillaz also made the song Andromeda?
This album is shit compared to Plastic Beach.
dont get me wrong i love gorillaz and still do but the new music is good but its not like it used to be is it just me? but i still love them
Listen to this rap then the Despicable me Theme XD same thing
best of the new alblum
but it s one way to make the gorilaz popular
its is so funny looking at coments and seeing a ton of comments about noodle the like "dares coments Noodles dancing is so nauthureal  its just graet and ya
This is a jam!
still can't tell if this is 3d or 2d 😕
The new album is so fucking amazing. So glad they're back!
Did you guys know that the main singer (other than 2-D) Is the guy Who sang "IM ONLY HUMAN!" For the Mass Effect Andromeda trailer??
Sounds like black bear
idk if any of you guys listened to greyson chance back in the day lol but whoever sings at 1:28 could literally be a young him

the bitch lives here in San diego...yeah that actually makes sense.
"I need help because I'm oppressed."  Or maybe it's because you chose to do poetry as a full-time job and blame it on the unfair world when it doesn't work out.

The attention whorism is extreme with this one.
I kind of wanna see idubbbz make a shit Kickstarter himself to get free internet money
His hair is so weird in this one
I would pledge 2000 and go to the gym with her
number 1 utuber😜😜😜😜
that bitch looks like a dude
Oh my god i thought the image of a severely burned back was a zoom in on a tandoori chicken
Homophobic slur
HiDubbzTV sweet vid
the person ends up getting more than $1600. fucking dumb SJWs
I watched the ads all the way through so u get ur utube money
Isn't Indi Go Go the name of that Majora's Mask Zora band?
hey idubbbz, youre a nigger faggot
Probably all tumblr donations
Don't you at least need a crappy flip phone to respond to interviews and also do other things like pay bills?
IT IS GOOD!
hmmm so being poor and being trans  means you need a  $ 2000 laptop
Did anybody else notice that IDubbbz has 22 pages open on his computer?
fuck me im trans queer and depressed u dont see me getitn a free internet laptop
Can you ask for anything on Kickstarter? These people are autistic
The ending is my favorite thing ever
eyedubz vs the sjw world .... Epic rap ba...

Or, you know...     She could just build a computer for like $200
You need a phone for a job. To get last minute shifts or phone interviews.
Here's a nice poem:  Roses are red Violets are blue I'm being oppressed by white males like YOU.
I was actually the platinum donator. I got the goofy selfie, and then we went to his house and I fucked his tight boypussy.
I have niggerism :(

The hunger games of victim hood idubbz your a legend I'm going to over throw the government in England we're im from and do that your be my second in command if you want
SJW laptop... cant use it if you have white privilage or are CIS X-D
"Chronic Pain" - in any other kickstarter this should prevent you from giving money to the project. It basically means "Yeah, I could drop dead any minute now."
My father has a major back pain problem - one of the discs in his spine is in the wrong place. Guess what, *he isn't begging for money online you attention-grubbing retard*.
Does this person think they're famous or something "Yeah if you can pay for a trip to america and pay an extra TWO GRAND you can spend a day with me"
and yes, Texas is the prettiest place in the world.
hate these PC snowflakes
There are very few people who can claim to have PTSD among rose are combat vets and rape victims, somehow I doubt this *MAN* is either.
I died at the end
why does edups keep calling him she?
I just became a poor and depressed trans and I'm disabled. give me money
you gay retard, there's no such thing as 5th or 6th degree burns. read a book cunt. also this queer woman IS an idiot. i agree.
I'm black , give me money, thanks.
She didn't need to mention the disabled bit. She already told us she was trans.
The cunts did it to you as well.
wtf is this shit idubbbz?
OurMine Are Back!... ( Read the description )   What
That was a fire poem
Isn't that the "Guy" from burning bridges blog network?
This is 3daaawwwg, OOWWWWW! and you're listening to Galaxy News Radio!

Guess what Idubbz is gay retard
Haha that song at the end :D

You mean The Little Whores
I dont understand this this, a film that is "related" to a religion, and 3 girls involved, can arise so many voice and dislike
Wow Hollywood KIKES back at it again with Christian Bashing, why don't they dare insult Islam, just because we are not murderous cult followers they can say and do whatever they wish, sad times we live in!
Please be as funny, if not funnier, than this trailer. PLEASE GOD hahah!
"It is trash. Pure trash -Catholic League" IVE NEVER LAUGHED LOUDER AHHAHA
WTF is this. yo hollywood bring me some original humour in 2017
hell to the yes
aubrey plaza .. she is the most sexy girl in the worrrrld .. the kind you can fuck her for hours and she still want more
The Catholic League review makes this
Saw the thumbnail be like, "O Aubrey Plaza dress as a priestess, something new". Listen first word comes out of her mouth. Yep it's Aubrey Plaza dress as priestess.
ITS AN APRIL LUDGATE AND RON SWANSON REUNION. YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"It is trash. Pure Trash" Coming from the Catholic League, it is a badge of honour! It helps that I cracked up many time during this trailer!
I feel like I'm gonna go to hell if i watch this.
Simply because Aubrey Plaza and Fred Armisan and Nick Offerman are in this... I will see it.
all the movies are against the catholic church. this is what the jews mention in the protocols of the elders of zion
what no jumpscare?!
Omg this is TRASH, i have to watch it
This looks really bad, the premise is ridiculous with some of the laziest dialogue I've ever seen in a trailer. Does Aubrey Plaza only have one role in her deck?
Whoever decided to include the review from the Catholic League trashing the movie is a genius
Terrible. Sausage Party terrible.
Pretty sure this movie won't be on Mexican cinema :( :(  will wait for the DVD
LOL at the Catholic Church's review.
Isn't brie and dave married in real life
poor old man,,,skull island look better than this..
Imagine this if it is done with Islam or Judaism or any minority religion, people think that'll be racist and disrespectful. Pity media and generation of whores.
I'll watch it despite Dave Franco. That's how bad I wanna watch it.
yes that's great.
Aubrey Plaza can spit on me any time she wants.
Low key gonna go see
I'm going to see this for no other reason than the Catholic League called it, "Trash. Pure Trash."
i don't know what i just watched but hell i'll give it a watch....
I like the soundtract
This movie is blasphemously hilarious
I want this movie the muslim variant.
nuns go wild and not exactly a porn
...sad how so many trailers have to play a certain type of music to, I guess, be cool...
Looks fucking hilarious  gonna need some popcorn to watch this
He is supposed to go to Berkeley...
Rated PG-13 Bring the whole fucking family, you piece of shit.
the first piece of guitar is beautiful ...from where can i get the full one of that sound
hahaha fucking nick offerman
Soooo, THAT happened...
'based on the decameron by boccacio' L M A O
One of the kinda things that would seem funny, but I dunno how they're going to stretch it into a full movie.
🔴 *The Little Hours* ((fuII~movie))    - plus.google.com/u/0/+VellyBernadette/posts/WQT1UM9Ekrs
this is just so wrong... this generation is just so... mad
alison brie with a potty mouth, love this💜
Aubrey's face when she said "Hey! DONT FUCKING TALK TO US!" 😂💀💀💀💀
annie!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Trash, pure trash" -- The Catholic League Pretty fucking God-damn hilarious!
fuck you dave
Jess Franco would be proud 😃
I love this
Film would be much more interesting if Islam was portrayed in such a manner.
Perhaps "Bad Nuns" would have been a better title.
I'm not Christian, but this is the most disgusting thing i've ever seen.
How come its okay to mock, hate, and make fun of Christianity religion but hell breaks loose when its another religion? People are such hypocrites. This movie is funny though, its worth watching if you like comedies.
Imagine if they did this for Islam
yep try this with Islam and you get WW3 but thats fine Christianity has been the punching bag of the world for a long time.
looks funny but I doubt it'll be that shocking compared to the classic nun-exploitation films of the seventies like school of the holy beast or the devils
The song is Bling Bling by Junglepussy if anyone was wondering
this is really disrespectful
Could we just take a second to admire Nick Offermans characters hair
junk    stupid     crap     junk     stupid     crap
trying way to hard.
lmao nick offerman
Well, this was literally a waste of my time.
the funny thing is that Boccaccio himself was a friar, but just so he could live without having to worry about money
LOL I will be watching this madness LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
mad the review said its trash 😭😭😭
worst trailer I've seen 8n yrs and wtf was that soundtrack
"It trash, pure trash" - Catholic League.  That had me on the floor
Aubrey Plaza & Dave Franco, not sure what I was expecting hahaha.
Dave has me weak...0_0
So when are they doing a muslim film like this? Oh wait. The muslims would cut off their faggot jew balls.
Anyone got the balls to do this with the muslim religion?
Looks awesome!
Aubery Plaza had to suck maybe 500 dicks to get where she's at.
looks amazing as fuck omg
Based on the Decameron, huh?  I'm gonna tell my AP Euro History teacher that there's a new documentary we should watch as a class.
This looks shit
Aaaahhhhhhhh
I'm not a professional in the making of trailers or anything but i don't think you should publicise a film mentioning a newspaper with a bad critic. just my opinion
Junglepussy Bling Bling is the song. You're welcome.
Monty python inspired filthcom
Priest:Where am i?  Your in HELL BITCH...!!!..hahhaha
Imagine the sheer outrage if this was a Islamic thing. People would be fucking slaughtered. Oh the double standards..
can anyone help me with the oni and officer skins
2 minutes without genji calling I Need healing. I call fake.
Kinda funny how no one talks about D.VA when this trailer was about revealing D.VA.  Waste of a trailer.
I need healing.
Is this the next hero/villain
2:00 dem bitty cheeks
He honestly sounds like a snake!XD  When I wasss young, I lived a life of Recklessssnesss.
Alternate ending: Genji: You do not have to fight alone! Zenyatta: *comes in from off screen and starts smacking Diablo with his orbs and spamming the, "I will not juggle" voice line*
What is the name of the soundtrack? (starts as 0:50)I tried searching for it but did not succeed
Blizzard I completed the challenges for the oni genji and dva but didn't get it on overwatch can you help?
The new episode of Samurai Jack looks great!!!!
They should change this map to look destroyed when Diablo destroyed it
Diablo looks amazing in this cinematic
This is legitness
Genji™        Teamwork not included.
Blizzard transitioning to Pixar/Anime cinematics part 3.
hey anyone wanna help me with the nexus challenge? username is DrunkUncle and I'll be online now
im here cuz i saw an ad about this and i wanted to see all the hate comments that heros of the storm ripped over watch ....turns out this is own by blizzered aha what is this game
oh snap makes me wanna play heros of the storm soo bad
So when is D.va going to be released?
Who wants to do the nexus challenge 5 games with me?
D.va and Genji working together kinda gives me a "new upcoming hero" feeling, will we see a hero with a dragon mech soon? Just askin', I just get that feeling when D.va randomly jumps in.
Please make this an event/brawl in Overwatch, it looks awesome!
anyone oneto play with me i need the oni skin :/ , just in case my name is : FireStorme#1489
whay with hanzo ??????
That was pretty cool
When did genji have super strength?
This is so cool I love it the man who always need healing and the girl who always eat Doritos and drink Mountain Dew!
Really? D.Va?
diva is my wife's daughter
XD so cool it gave me goosebumps
When I read the title, I actually thought this was Herpes of... something. Click baited.
Stars bouncing off, sword not cutting, literally doing nothing to him. "Genji please switch".
Here comes all the weebs
lol D.VA hitting the literal definition of the Devil with a giant robot mech like a train.
I like this version of hanamura
stupidest rip off pf the.best game overwatch i tjink only the real overwatch is good and if you have this game you are super cheap and idiotic
What is this budget OW cinematic?
I ship them
I mean, D.va is cool and all, but I don't think genji would approve unless she pulls a heath kit outta her ass...  "I NEED HEALING!"
D.va 1, Diablo 0.     Genji: 1 ult wasted
Classic efficent Genji ult, dash and once slice
anyone else get an asmr feeling while watching this?
Why d.v.a -.-
Can you add Deathwing after D.VA
NEW ship genji and diablo <3
What does dude say after he gets thrown by the monster and pulls out his sword and that green dragon appears
love this so much!!!! XD
Someone please capture every second in high resolution picture so i can use it as wallpaper. Once you have done please let me know. Thanks
Typical genji players not pushing the payload.
Wasn't hots trailers suppose to be on much lower budget?
How come they made this video?
oh god... I got a hard on..
D.va... she is essentially reversed Fenix. So... might as well add in Fenix now... right....
Can Blizz just make a dark and evil trailer, every trailer is about a hero overcoming bad odds...
this is just overwatch
bad trailer dva can't shoot while flying
dragon always represent Chinese, and kill Japanese like slaughter animals . this is bullshit, no Japanese can become a dragon, stop shaming  our legacy
This is why I love heroes, being able to see Blizzard characters from different universes is amazing
but on my journey i have learn another lesson , i need healing!
Thumbnail looked like something from Brazzers
When blizzard gets lazy with character
I need healing!
Nice butt Genji
Im loving this new Genji & D.Va vs Mei fight
play if the game
I NEED HEALING!
Was that supposed to be Diablo?
I NEED HEALING-
apparently Satan can lose to a mortal
Are you kidding me?! Genji's ult duration has been buffed, and you dare call your game balanced?
fake, his ult doesn't last that long
Just MAKE A DAMM MOVIE ALREADY!!!!!
You do not have to fight alone! becasue genji has low health. LOL
Other overwatch heroes that we need. Reaper, Mercy, Soldier 76 and Roadhog.
Typical Blizzard making cinematics that hype me for a game I don't want to play.
Shadow Warrior 3 Preview Trailer looks dope
Genji and Dva do make a great team. If Dva is official for HoS so awesome.
they dont stand a chance against diablo lol
please we need more diablo heroes like imperius please
Got that Buffy Sainte-Marie voice!
That's pretty damn good.  The kind of thing you have to listen to the end...and then want more.
When you see two really talented guys performing, without the need of autotune, you know they have something special.
Hello from Ukraine:) It was awesome!! I can't stop listening this song.You guys should represent your country on Eurovision contest here! Good luck to both of you !!!
I was never good at science in school. But now I understand what "chemistry" can actually mean.
Gorgeous! So effortless and pure. Really breath taking performance.
awesome....
cheers from Italy, you are on the most important  national newspaper
The guy in the back ground tho
Wow outstanding
Pleease tell me you poled it after all that
Dude well done.... If your interested in a Promo Video doing contact me via my page..... https://www.facebook.com/christopherellisphotos/
Butterflies in my stomach !
Brilliant amazing voice seriously you guys need to get signed up.
The best thing I have heard in ages, brilliant. Good luck to you xx
your welcome your gonna be huge keep sharing this peeps!!! real talent
shivers down my spine!!! best perfomance without any help as nowadays stars use. they need to team up
Sing together again? That's amazing 👋💕💕
I hope you both end up getting something good out of this, best of luck dude!
Could listen to this all day!
Two great performers - good luck for the future, hope you get that "lucky break" you are both stars xx
You guys should hook up again and make this a download !! Amazing both of you..
brilliant !!!! gave me shivers
Gave me goosebumps, you sound incredible together.
incredible ! so beautiful you both connected through music <3
Wow. Just wow.
Amazing voice!! Both of you have such great talent! Beautiful song!
I have the same socks... yeah
they really are dropping these "Trump sucks" line way often. And it's not even funny
it's May 5. why am I not dead yet?
ruined a perfectly good coffee cake :(
march the 3rd is my bithday. what i wanted for my present was to dstroy earth
I guess it worked since to day is the 4th may the fourth be with you
Trump is still better than Hilary
What is the name of that creepy song?
A meteor the size of Texas would break the earth into pieces.
who thinks this is true. socialism without capitalism is communism, and capitalism without socialism is fascism
I was with you until you started shit-talking Westworld. Now I will sit in silent judgment and try not to laugh.  Edit: Damn you for being funny.
WTF is this generic meme bullshit, give me something spicy!
Nice!! Hahahahaha loved it!
launch the shuttles??? lmao
But capitalism is the best system in the world..... so why did they say that
I love all the people saying "Learn to take a joke!" over the Trump comment. There can still be an agenda in comedy like there can be an agenda in everything, just don't be closed-minded. P.S The Holocaust was hilarious
Lol Ally is so excited to try heroin XD
My biggest problem with this sketch is Raphael's playing a general and he has a Goatee.   I can buy everything else about the sketch except that. Suspension of disbelief is a strange thing.
Lookng forward of seeing more of Ally and Raphael. More about Katies drug addictions would be highly appreciated as well.
OMG this is the best
I'm actually quite alarmed at how convincing their argument for just letting the world die was...because let's face it, we really truly have fucked it all up.
libtards and their stupidity
westworld wasnt disapointing...
Where. Is. Zac.
So after everything, you get excited by an underwhelming Star Wars trailer. Bravo.
Why would you make a video in 21:9 aspect ratio and then NOT render and upload it in 21:9??
wait... on March Third???         That's the switch's release date.     DUN DUN DUN
Their best video in a while.
March 3rd was the Switch launch...
How disappointing west world was? Wtf are you on abou?
What Is this from?
The new background at the end looks goofy.
Yeah screw capitalism we need communism it's sorta working for China
You guys know this is a joke right?
It's just a prank, bro.
It was funny until you had to bring up politics. Why do good youtubers/content creators always fucking bring up politics? Unsubbing.
I'M CRYING FR
Cynisism is for lazy losers who can't be arsed to find solutions and work to make this world better. Instead they take solace in giving up thinking they've reached some kind of higher insight. Pathetic.
THIS IS LIBERAL PROPAGANDA!!! IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU THAT ARE TURNING THE FROGS GAY!!!
Jesus Christ this is hilarious.          -Trump supporter
let the world die like your channel
I laughed so hard when he said United Airline
Earth isn't going anywhere until I play Kingdom Hearts 3.
noooo i really liked Westworld 😂 also let's be positiiiiive but great scetch
This hits too close to home.  Cartoons and anime are my life support.  The world can't end until I run out of quality entertainment.
on the day the switch releases!?!?!?
I'm preparing for a political debate in the comments.        Be careful everyone.
I don't understand why people think capitalism is such a bad thing. Sure it has its negative qualities, but it's the driving force of economies and new technologies.
disliked with passion <3
I agree with ch, just let it go.
Thank goodness there gonna let it go
You said wot about Westworld
This really is a notably brilliant video guys, good job ^_^
college humor is built on capitalism. Trump will be glorious. freedom. praise kek.
f*** it up with capitalism? well isn't communism and socialism that have a weird history f****** the world since 1900s?
That ending song
I honestly wouldn't mind if an asteroid hit earth tomorrow as long as I had a little advanced notice
they've got a point
? trump is doing great...fucking liberal fucks..quit watching buzz feed and CNN
Best part of this is that even the whiners who hate Trump are going to bite the dust too.  Best idea ever.
Is that Raph? I love that guy!
capitalist u fukers dont know shit
make something that's not bias
trump all the mother fucking time with these fucking snow flakes
I totally support the letting the world end option.
Hahaaaa yeahhhh
best arosmith cover ever
Cant wait to Fk thing up before the end of the world
Just Let The Jew's Die. Better title in my opinion.
So basically, the world would end if it weren't for George Lucas?
This could have been funny. Then politics.
That outro <3
Planned obsolesence and socio-economic divide will kill us longggg before an indifferent falling rock does.
star wars has saved the day.
bond movie rule this separate educator debate
That general is my spirit animal
"Maybe they won't F- it up via student films.."
Grant's subtle rape song at the end omg wtf lol
>the eu falling apart >bad
I wanna like but the Trump thing is so annoying. I don't care for him but obviously half of Americans do
capitalism and student films
Remember when collegehumor was college humor?
This isn't comedy, this is what actually needs to happen.  Humans are a failure.
Star Wars? Really???
That was the most beautiful metaphor I've ever seen.
you and your channel are garbage.
OH NO!!!!! That's tomorrow!
hahahahahahahaahahahaha
what is the song at 7:50?
i feel so sad watching this like  ugh this place is amazing too bad the owner doesn't finish this😢😢 so sad so sad😭

You should go to Baguio.
Don't read my name
3:17     That's a New 2DS XL, not a phone.
andddddd none of these are out to buy, and probably never will be.
microsoft triple flip was revolutionary. its a shame it didnt do well in the market
The Nokia 888 looks fake
just watching this with my infinity screen...
This video is retarded
lol they put walking dead
can i get some of these on Amazon
I want a bendy phone too
dude wtf nintendo? and smartphones?
there is no nintendo plus. its the new nintendo 2ds xl you fucking moron
A bendable phone is horrible
My phone has 6 camaras so ha
The first one is something I can't break let me get that
omg, british accents are so grating
this is the last vid I am seeing on my s6 edge
almost all the so called version of "smartphone" is just a concept and prototype
Kind of misleading title, those are just concepts. And for the nintendo phone is just the 2dsxl...
Gay-mmicks phone
For the Nintendo plus you showed the reveal for the 2ds xl
I'm no scientist but I'm pretty sure the new 2ds is a handheld console
First of all, the Nintendo plus is a 2ds not a phone. I can't see how you got confused there.
on nokia 888 is just paper when they show it on the videos XD
"Knock-ee-a," huh? That's adorable.
this is awsome i will accept your command i will subscribe
Damn all of those are damn awesome.I didn't know it exists.
3:21 Reminds me of the 3ds
No one of dose are real except the lenovo
How could you be that stupid?
how much are they
You cant call with it and its called new nintendo 2ds XL
this can't be serious
But the 2ds XL is not a phone.
I Don't Like the Last one it's like a piece of papar
I cringed when he said the New 2ds xl was a phone
that's a nintendo 2ds xl not a nintendo plus but whatever I guess
I'll just stick with Samsung Galaxy S8
thats a ds XD
whats the background song called?
THE NINTENDO PLUS DOESNT FUCKING EXIST. THE FOOTAGE IS OF THE NEW NINTENDO 2DS XL. PLEASE KILL YOURSELF.
Most of these are concepts. This is misleading information. Please stop.
Roses are red Violets are blue I came from the video picture  How about you?
the Nokia 888 is a joke
How does this idiot mistake the 2ds XL for a phone...
Well congrats,most of you comment section include gaming nubes telling you the difference of a revolutionary system and a 90's toy
Them 2 phones on the thumbnail looked awesome af
Obviously, Nintendo 2DS XL is a phone
I'm looking forward to the Hand Phone like in Total Recall 2012
What movie is that at 5:25?
most of the description r wrong of these gadgets.
Most of these are ugly and I bet they work horribly
Half those "phones" were not much more than concepts and failed prototypes.
I love how you say "phones are all starting to look alike" then cut to a scene with two black guys... :D
3:48 first of all that is not a phone. Second of all that is a game counsel. Third of all this channel is stupid
M8 the 3 ds is not a phone
This guy.. my god he thinks a Nintendo is a phone
i dunno if i can trust these vids anymore! nintendo plus wtf?!
I can just imagine how expensive these are.
what about playing roblox ON YOU'RE RIST
Can you please give the link of all this Phones? I want one! but i don't know which one

So your telling us that iphones are now useless
This video should hve been posted on Techzone
Ara got canceled :(
I'm not the only one to say that the triple flip phone is just awesome

"It comes at night" so does every teenage boy across the world
he takes off his mask at the start and then his voice sounds like the masks still on??
It comes at night or YOU cum at night? 😂👏OK OK I'm sory
is this gonna be like the happening? it comes?
That is a kiss that I definitely don't want. Fucking gross
Horror film eh, so 99% it will suck.
This movie came out years ago, it's called The Thing.
*It Comes at Night (2017) M0VIE* https://plus.google.com/u/0/+cinematrix21/posts/6BNPEemhw4Z
you call that a freaking TEASER!? you showed how the whole movie is going to go! way to spoil it for us.
Is this a sneaky I Am Legend spinoff?
Double toasted brought me here
It 'feels' like I've just watched my first horror movie... Since I literally 'cannot' watch horror movies, I've seen enough... For horror movie fans, I guess this is a good thing...
Already the most cliche movie
This is a porn movie right?
This is a movie you watch once in the cinema and never watch again because you always remember what happens making it no longer interesting.
The man specifically says "The red door stays close" But the acronym for the movie is... I Can't (shhhhhh..... ik)
This kinda gave too much away which tbh I shouldn't be surprised with trailers nowadays
Yas.  Looks awesome.  Sad about the dog though - didn't see it around much during the trailer.  Probably the first to go ☹️
Comes night time,  they'll be romping outside in the moon light  :-)
I tend to cum at night aswell
Just when you thought the Zombie apocalypse movie fad was over...
So apparently Charlie left New York after his heroin addiction
This has a feel reminiscent to I Am Legend.
Reminds me 10 Cloverfield  Lane and Signs.
The title sounds like the title of a short creepypasta.
My dyslexia almost read this as "the night man cometh"
Trump  comes at night
take my money!!
Gordo the Weirdo!
I come at night
WHAT IS "IT"?  Comment your theories below!!
Damn I really want to see this..
1:04  *sad reality of my life*
All I know is when I see a red door, I want it painted black.
I wonder if the main character transforms into the thing? I mean he was only one with key? It seemed the cute girl infected the other guy?
A24 SO effing good,e everything is bomb.
Why don't they just get in in a car and drive to the big city. Maybe live there instead of a creepy secluded cabin?
Good Horror is officially back!
If there is something in the woods then why not burn down the forest and get the hell out of there?
I been waiting too c this film like forever can not wait too c it when it comes out.
I've noticed that I love A24 movies.
This trailer sucks! It didn't even show me the monster, who dies, or all the plot twists 😡
What's this based on?
and at the end there's nothing at night and it is just his own sick kind of game and everybody is going mad because of fear
This should've been named "The other side of the door"
You know what else comes at night? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Please dont let the dog die
I see a red door, I want it painted black.
A24 makes quality shit.  They've made all of my favorite new movies over the past few of years.
You wanna know what else comes at night?
Gordo the 'weirdo'
"It comes at night." Sounds like the shits that come after eating Mexican food.
Guys, i know black lives matter but they have to die first. Still. Always.
"we never go out at night" Bitch goes out to night the next shot
french define process once peak airline.
The freaks come out at niiigggghhhtt~
What's the big deal? I come at night too. Sometimes in the morning.
Looks cliche as hell... pass.
Don't know about you, but this reminds me of The Thing. The good one from 1982!
I don't understand what "it" is
watched this trailer in the dark at 3am, no jump scares, looks like another stupid piece of thriller shit.
It turns you into an Asian.
"It comes at night, you'd betta run, these wing-ed things, are not much fun..."
The guy with the beard looks like Liam Payne from 1D lmao
"they mostly come at night, mostly"
The dog does die... pause at 1:54... on the bottom you can see something with fur.
Is it just me or do most of these comments seem fake lol
I love older horror movies but hate the current horror genre. However, A24 has a few good horror movies that come out each year and they're always amazing.
Pennywise comes and goes as he pleases.
In my mind it was, Fear turns men into pussies.
so basically a new cabin fever
This looks fucking great!!
well was planning to watch it but guess i already have.. 😑
looks like a movie directed by M night Shyamalan if it is then i  aint watching it
Sort of reminds me of Cabin Fever with the sickness included in it. But this looks interesting though. I'll definitely check this one out.
I Am Legend in a different location????
A lot of things comeee at night😂😂😂
yeah but what fucking comes at night? I'm not even watching it now because you don't tell us
idbm 4 or 4.3 maximum
A24 are making so many awesome movies right now 👍👍
is this movie the creepy pasta??
looks cool.
That guys sorta looks like young wolverine
I wanna see tgsi
We will be there, Dude!
I really hope that dog grows wings and flies away from that hell-hole lmao
I also cum at night.      Pornhub
shrek comes at night
Spitting image of Conan O'Brien.

Check out "Critic - On My Way" the video is ridiculous, inspired by travis scott
This is something that someone would dream of while they are high
Am I the only one who can't stand kendricks voice?
If he'd have released this song right after the album-release it already would have Over 100mio clicks for sure
Visuals are a little "It G Ma"-ish. I dig it.

Drug Simulator 2017 - Kendrick Lamar DLC                                   jokes aside this track is lit as fuckkkkk

When the devil is scared of what he created.
littttty as a tite
I had to watch this with some holy water
Travis sold his soul to the devil to get rich and famous kind of half mumble singing without any actual talent.  In exchange he had to make this video
Songs like this be making it hard to stay off of tha WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
This is fucking lit.
That fucking dog growl scared the shit out of me lol 😥😥

"and that's a clock." LOL
HE'S SO EXCITED!!! I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!
Well done for 6 million subscribers
wuts that headset?
Why would you pretend to be high? Because you don't want to smoke or take drugs but people around you expect it from you so you pretend?
More more more!!
I need more of this!
if you dip an icecube in cake batter then put in a crumb, you can deep fry it. We talked about it my culinary class. We get REALLY bored
My life is great.  Just the other day I took a sip of my deep fried water and smoked some catnip as I watched babies fight to the death.
PLEASE do another
just so you know, you CAN deep fry water. You just freeze it and put it in the frier. And you should try deep fried egg nog.
I recognized that "fight to the death" bit from when Mark did this.  Funny stuff man
Quick 10 mins that.
I don't know why but all this talk about Markiplier gave me an erection I don't know why I may need to get checked
Can you deep fry water?? Are you serious?...I've lost all faith in humanity
My dad's cousin went to the hospital complaining of stomach pains. The nurse told her she was having a baby. She was horrified, and asked, "Where is it going to come out at?!" So apparently she thought she was a virgin.
You should show the screen of the person who is actually playing.
Where's his new vid
Tejb "damn they're not fighting??" Lmaooo!!!!
will you be making anymore dead realm videos?
But you can deep fry water!!!!!
What is a curtain with no eyes?      Blind.
I like how everyone thinks that acting happy is fucked up not the reason why u hav to act happy. For example I personally hav to act happy so people don't realise I'm dead on the inside.
what the he'll is a hufflepuff hahaha A Very Potter Musical reference <3
MORE OF THIS!
What happened to Cathy? And Adam
I'm french..
Adults need the security blankets due to the night terrors.
Seananners should play more scary games
Iv Achly smoked cat nip ... Not joking 😂
why did he keep looking left
"Cats are awesome, but dogs are great." Never agreed with someone more in my life. 😂
Had a really good laugh at this! :D
This is awesome doorw stuff like this
I had a dream about the dolphin gods giving me a dolphin booty
SEANANNERS you CAN actually deep fry water. Look it up it's amazing
what's the website
Oh my god..I forgot about you guys..! Ive been here since you guys played Black ops zombies?? Its been sooooooo long :o
This was great fun to watch
When you see on the screen "what the hell is a stiles". My teen wolf heart glowed
the thing is you can deep fry water
like 5 months late Adam
Can you do more of these videos there hilarious
You should try playing Dark Souls 3  with friends :D
Is this a game or a website? If website what's the link?
Good to know I wasn't the only one to say orgasm

Hej Tejbz, you're not cool with the frenchies!! And Diction too, think about the french viewers :') Joking, keep going.
I need more of this in my life :D

Is this guy even human? He doesnt age
Honestly, I don't know if he really tried to smoke the catnip...
Beard Adam is the best!!!! Keep the beard please
Great video. Keep up the good work man :)

hay um im not a talker but um love the video really man i would love for we can play a game one day will bye
1 thing i kno, you can deep fry mars bars
Mark had a hand in "fight to the death" and "subscribe to Markiplier" (obviously)
Hey nanners can you add the questions in text, I kinda got lost on some questions.
Whoever said acid is bad for cats Was not a cat on acid
I'm French, and I'm offended....Nah, jk ! I'll forgive Adam anything <3
Make more of these Adam or I'll smoke all your catnip
you sink into a water bed and it suffocates you
"what age can babies fight for the death" Lmao
Sometimes I wish my fiance were more like Nanners so that he'd be open to having more cats and smoking catnip as a family.
what's with all those answers lol... its like a computer picked a random  set of answers... wait
That was a good one made me laugh. Keep up with the new content its great 😊
Wait, why did you invert the colors?
Wow, Adam knows the Internet damn well.
Why are his colors inverted
Hey Nannerman you know they brought back crystal pepsi
Water has been fried before it is possible
More more more, thats is hilairous!
who used to remember when seananners mad 3 minute videos 😂
I'm waiting for them play Family Feud and Seananners to shave his head. EGG FATHER SHALL BECOME ALL
I wonder if you can get high on catnip. I can just imagine a cat with a trench coat.
*hits catnip* 'What age can babies fight to the death'
If it were possible i would put down a picture i have
"Why would you want to PRETEND to be high?" THANK YOU ADAM.
what kind of headset does nanners have?
Wow I just got a 82 minute ad at the end of the video
Please do this again
when you read comments about babies and markiplier but don't understand their connection
Tebjz - "Is it wrong to..." Brain - "Don't say it. DON'T SAY IT!" Mouth - "Pick up girls in a dungeon?" *facepalm*
Where's Cathy?
This was hilarious! More plx
You can also make catnip tea! It's good for them intestinal cramps and indigestion.

Domino king can you make a the greninja line and include ash greninja please.
this is so cool It's the beginning of a new era of space travel right there
Why does everyone say it's a reversed take-off when a child could see that it's the opposite.
Things are starting to get 'Ray Bradbury- ish'.
Kim Jong Un would let Trump sit on his face for one of these.
North Korea's special missile.
Fake and gay
I knew it! All CG. Kubrik did the moon landing, but this is all George Lucas. No wonder he needed to sell off Star Wars. Had to focus on his new job at Space X.
Flat Earth not this shit 🌎
Does nobody realize that this is just a launch played in reverse..?
*CGI*  THIS IS FAKE US PROPAGANDA CREATED BY DISNEY. MICKEY MOUSE IS A CIA OPERATIVE CONTROLLED BY THE JEWS.
I would have to see this in person to truly believe this.
Play this video backwards and get ready for your mind to be blown.
FAKE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i looked at the video 3 times
Is it really hard to believe that in a age where we can communicate via internet, scientist cannot create a re-usable rocket?
AMERICA! FUCK YAH WE GONNA BLOW UP RUSSIA WITH THAT MISSLE YAHHH
Launch Played Backwards 😂
Fuck...So cool...tits ass corn hole...   finger tourettes
this is soo fake, the film was reversed
Bro I thought that was a country trying to bomb us when I saw it yesterday
I know rockets are real, flight is real...but it just looks fake, cgi..... How impressive the technology in those rockets to stabilize a 100' x 12' diameter TUBE
North koreas last nuke launch.
Fake and gay
YouTube is controlled by the left.. They send anything but positive things Trump is doing daily to trending.. next time I wanna ride that rocket :))
Yes the water curves on globe earth.
that was 12cm off
this could be a video played backwards... fuck off
That technology is so kick ass
CG fake! They clearly just reversed the footage of a rocket taking off. Rockets can't actually land, that's just what they want you to believe. Hexagonal earth confirmed...
"Another happy landing."
I love how routine this is becoming.
CGI is the new real
This is a video of a take off, in reverse.
How is this trending lol?
This looks like a reverse Rocket launch.
So cool it almost looks unreal.
Another happy landing.
does anyone know how tall that thing is?

Amazing technology!
As an old fart that faintly remembers seeing men on the moon live on TV, Seeing this gives me a helluva hard-on!!

An actual country song sang by an actual country artist such a breath of fresh air. Chris Stapleton and Miranda lambert are the last of the mainstream COUNTY singers. BRO COUNTY SUCKS!!!!
Glad to see this video. I lost my little buddy Max to lymphoma 4/17/17 and that was the first day I heard this song on the radio...the lyrics pretty much nailed how I felt, still feel that way too.
i wonder if blake regrets picking someone over her... lol
Miranda knocked this out of the ballpark...Love
SO VERY BEAUTIFULLY SUNG AND SO TRUE
you could hear a pin drop while she was singing. talk about stage presence. heartbreaking but my favorite song from the album
it was the Best performance of the night. ...Truly
One of the most authentic voices of our time ,Miranda also seems to be very down to earth . She is a bright light as  country music turns to this blended pop music crap.
she's barely holding it together. it's so sad but such a good song. it's got some deep emotional lyrics. I love her!
beautiful singer..beautiful song.. enough said.......
my fav. from the album. though I love every song. this song is just so so... good
It wasn't until after she finished playing that I realized it was just Miranda and her guitar! I didn't even realize her whole band wasn't there. She's so mesmerizing. :)
Sorry that was his woman lol..thats my song lol...
I like this song! The fine perfomance by Miranda Lambert!
How's the Mr. Cowardly Lion feeling now when he's driving in his pick up truck down the lonely yellow dirt road? We all know who that ones for?
Raw and incredible. Could listen to her all day.
THIS just made me cry! When a song can move you to tears, it's a good one!
Hey there my Country Goddess...my Fav and she is SO fine, you rock !!!!
Imo hands down best song she has ever had.  Bursting with relatable emotion.  Beautiful song and performance.
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL HUMAN! GOD I LOVE HER! she is old school country with a new age twist. Not like most "country" artist these days. Well done Miranda..Bless you :)
This is the most beautifully heart-wrenching song. I heard it for the first time performed live on the ACMs and I just bawled. So beautiful.
Chills. Hitting the broken heart here. Deep. Hauntingly sweet. Love it Miranda!
She laid her heart right out on that stage.
Miranda is the best. Her writing performance and keeping it together skills are EPIC
brilliant , love this .
I really hope she makes a good music video for this song.
The "heart" in this song is undeniable. Powerful. Thank you Miranda
I have no words for how great this is.
Miranda is absolutely amazing!  Love Love Love this song!
iam waiting for Gwen Stefani to sing tin man, y'all heard me, do do do looken out Blakes back door, Haha, guess who?
ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE this song
This song is so amazing .. I can't even begin to explain. I'm so in love with the "Ohhhh" parts 😫😭🙏🏼❤️❤️
You just can't get any better than this pure perfection
I absolutely love this song !
She's so much prettier than Gwen.
Love this, she is the best at what she does period!
This is the most beautiful and meaningful performance ever!!
I wonder if Blake was there
This song means so so soooooooooooooooooooooooo much to me
love that song! first time I've heard it! Miranda Lambert, you are so f*ing talented and so amazing! So blessed to have you! The song is so heartbreaking....gut wrenching. Thanks
When I watched this live I had tears in my eyes.  What a powerful emotional performance.  And the fact her record label wanted her to do an upbeat song and she said F that and just blew everyone away.
Fuk that was sad
I don't like the song.
great job Miranda keep up the great songs we love you
This is where Blake crawls on hands and knees trying to sneak out of there
i wanna see Blake's reaction to this song
She is so beautiful and this was the best song of the night.  Love this version.
No one even moves. They are so hypnotized with Miranda's beautiful voice & singing! Such a beautiful thing to see! Rock on Miranda!
I'm seeing Redneck Rainbows
This is one of the most beautiful performances of all time
You can hear the heart break in her voice.... I love how she sings with such passion and feelings! True talent right there folks!
I love this song! 💖
why isn't this song being played in the radio?? why isn't doing good on the charts? it's such a heartfelt and beautiful song
this performance made me cry
Oh my good gracious! I freaking love her!!! Had the chance to see her in concert here in Tulsa, OK at the BOK center! She was lovely!! Like this if you love Miranda! 🙌🏽💜😘
So in love with this song.   you don't want a heart 😭😭
Such a raw talent. So rare these days!
I love the godly sounds of my home town girl. I live just a few miles north of Lindale in Quitman Texas
She's AWESOME in every way
I love this video
She's a whole lot better than Gwen Stefani ever thought of
this is pure gold....love it
She's an everyday Angel to Everyone
an absolutely stunning live act
Miranda is "as good as it gets" beautiful performance and song. I'm so glad you got to be and feel that kind of love the heartache isn't as much fun. Hang in there...
LOVE YOU MIRANDA! YES, WELL DESERVED THIS STANDING OVATION....
You make the difference of country music girl !!!🙌
OMG YESSSS!! Now we can re watch this as many times as we'd like??? #day made!
She is the fucking Queen I am so happy that she is releasing this
And this is why she holds the record of best female vocalist!!!!
I listen to this almost everyday.
Best performance that night!
Beautiful and heartfelt  She's awesome
They should have put it under a hot shower
You could use hot water from their faucets
Today is my 10th birthday can I have 1 like please ❤️
Just turn on the hot water in the sink to melt the ice and u have got everything back again within like 5-7 min. 😂😂😂
hot water from the tap duhh lol
They totally could have put it in the sink & turn the hot water on.... lol
Is it just me or does joe look like Justin foley from 13 reasons why?👍🏽
U r so good at editing👍 keep up the good work!!
#22 on trending!!!
do they not have a microwave or would that backfire miserably?
Joe is a complete FAGGET
You need water to do this prank. No africans can do this lmao
When Caspar got the hammer and almost broke the mug 😂😂😂
When poor caspar thought he could escape joe's pranks.....XD
The height difference between josh and their cleaner was too cute 😂❤️
the prank is cool and stuff but can we all appreciate how josh and caspar have matching pijamas I just think that's fascinating😍😂
I'm definitely going to do this prank 😂
sooo Caspar when u gonna prank Joe back?
Whoever disliked this video....you have like no sense of humour
Do a house tour
More pranks joe
hello guys I'm just learning English.I seriously can't figure out what does 'get warmer and colder' means in 7:03.Greatly appreciate if you guys can help me out!
Joe I think it would be rlly funny if you got musically 😂😂😂😂😂 like if you agree
Long live the king 👑
OMG ssssssssooooooooooo cool and funny
i got a question: why didn't they just put it on the sink and let warm water run over it?
It went well
i hear my f@$king heartbeat in my brain and its going to explode, but its one of Joe's pranks, so........ f*ck.
I love how chill Caspar was and Josh was pissy throughout the whole prank😂😂👌🏼
I hate people who:  1.) like there own comment 2.) comment on their own comment
they could've just chucked it all in the oven on low for a bit...
9:18 "Little Ugly Face"
8:13 look at his face XD
HAHAHAHAHAHA so fun!!!!
This prank is so funny bc of josh's reaction omg 😂😂
you aren't ugly
CASPAR WAS SO CUTE ON THIS ALL SMILES AND CHEERFUL
I wish Caspar will do a prank too!!
DO MORE PRANKS .. they are AMZING
Lol Caspar and the hammer
At 0:20 it says DONT DO IT!
"Did you put my f**king keys in there??"Josh's face made my day 😂😂
Couldn't they just use hot water from the tap instead of the kettle?
I think you should  stop pranking caspar prank josh instead
The cleaner is my fave
They could've just put the stuff in hot water from the bath/shower 😂😂😂😂😂
Why couldn't they heat water up on the stove
Why don't they go to a coffee shop or some shit lol
do you idiots not have running water? jesus
Good job on trending!!
joe can u do a slime making video
can you do a zip cord prank like close the drawers and the scissors
i love the maid she's so precious
I miss the old outro
I love how caspar is a good sport and handles pranks and jokes so well
Why dont they run the hot tap in the shower/bath/sink?😂😂
happy star wwars day may the 4th be with you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Awwww "they just like seeing my little ugly face" 🙈
caspar at the end is so funny and cute LOL "you cant always get me like that buddy!"
the cleaning lady knows how to deal with you guys 😂
They can put hot water to melt the ice HAHAHAHA😂😂
What do you use in editing your videos?
Why didn't they just run it under sink water
They could have just used warm tap water😂😂🤷🏼‍♀️
why can't they use hot water from the faucet
You should've just filled the whole freezer draw with water and put everything in there
oh look more zoom edits and pranks......  feels like the only thing missing is a clorax reference.  drink the bleach mang.
I'm sure they have hot water from the tap?
They could've placed it in running water HAHA
Why didn't they use the hot water in the taps? Shower? Sink?
"U can't do that buddy "😂
why didnt they just leave the ice in the sink with hot water 😂😂 wouldve melted quicker
They could've just put water in there or ran it over water, the ice would melt
This doesn't work in a student flat because all the dishes and utensils  are already unusable and mouldy in someone's room.
mugs crack when you freeze them
When joe said on his vlog channel he was having a sleepover I thought of one word PRANK
poor little casper
he can just put the container into the microwave or put it under hot water. Or he can eat with his hands
why not just put it under the tap hahaha, and so cute that Joe was in a tent
Why didn't they just use hot tap water???? 😂
Couldn't they have just run it under the tap?
I love the joe and casspar movie
React cyan of happiness
they could of run it under the tap lol
Caspar handled this prank way better then the previous ones 😂😂😂 I can't say the same for Josh 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Joe you kill me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
do they not have hot water in their faucets lmao
ugly?!!! no way you are  hot!!!!
don't they have hot water at home? lol
awww the clean lady is so nice and cute, i like the way she laughs at them😂😂
Joe, you are so original 😂❤
Just got back from a 3 week trip through Japan, miss it allready. Planning on going back in September again
Hi! Exc video. Which Hotel is the one in Tokio? Thank you
Great video, very informative. Thank you 😊
I don't think i'd enjoy such a tour ..... but ... i guess there must at least be a first some day in that regard :-X Especially after watching such an appealing video about the tour ^^
Hi Angela, Hello from Seattle! Awesome video I love it ♥️😉 Keep up the awesome video and places you goto 👍😀
was this a sponsored trip? how much it cost? 🤔
Your videos are getting better and better.
I enjoy the video :) thanks for sharing
so a group of friends and i are going to japan next year around mid march and im just curious if it will be relatively cold. also is it not the best time to go see the cherry blossoms?
I thoroughly enjoyed this video. You provided lots of great suggestions for things to see, do, and eat! :D
Angela the quality of your videos is amazing!💕I'm so happy that this video came out in my B-day
Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.  Awesome!
Awesome video😊
Can't you do a video where you hike the MT. Fuji? That would be amazing for your channel Angela :)
Superb editing and very good video, thanks for efforts 👍
*I wish I could do the love rock walk and meet you on the other side, Angela. As always your videos are great.*
These videos are so amazing
i don't really like powder green tea cos it's grainy and the taste too 😣 i prefer the leaf kind all the way.
Your humor and personality is wonderful to watch.
The tourist guide English sounded like she's either a Malaysian Chinese or Singaporean Chinese when she speaks in the bus.
I have a question.. When you get out of the airport and to your hotel room, do you take your suitcases with you on the bus or do they take you back to the same hotel room each day?? Love your videos! 💕
You always seem to know how to make extremely useful Japan travel videos, add to that a great personality and a consistent upload means a recipe for succes. Keep up the good work Angela!
No Arashiyama? Its a must see in my opinion if you are around Kyoto with its bamboo grove forest.
You are not bad with Takoyaki. Great video!
Thank you for a great video once again!! I was looking for tour companies that are based in Japan and this helped me a lot!!
Wuu this one was short and pack! 👍 I still can see the snow. When it was film? I mean the date
what kind of camera are you using?  the quality  is awesome.
Konnichiwa Angela! It's my first time in Japan, and I arrived yesterday. I really love your videos, and you give me so many ideas for my 3 months trip! Keep up the good work :)
Yehey! a new video.. =) its perfct..♥
Great video Angela, and totally loved the thumbnail - super crisp and inviting. :-) Have a great Golden Week... What's left of it!  Thomas
Thank you so much Angela for this video! I was beginning to get cold feet about visiting Japan, the language barrier, as always, your video warmed them back up! This is the way to go! Gotta start saving!
internationally ME you are so pretty  and I never get bored of seeing your face  .... hehehe
I'll be going soon! Wish you could help guide me around.. that would be awesome! For now i'll take tips from the videos! Thanks!!
it's amazing how much you can do and see in such a short period of time:o trip has to be well planned
great video and interesting to take a tour like this.... Thank you for all your work so far. You are awesome!
brilliant and informative video, definitely added to my bucket list!
Good video! I visited some of these places in the last few weeks too. Best time of year to go there. Japan is a great country to travel.
Hi, When did you travel to japan what month, so I could know the season and the best place to travel in that season
I loved Takayama!! I just went there 2 months back. Will like to visit again. BTW Another great video from you again :)
Beautiful video, and you look so beautiful in your kimono, I wonder how much it cost for the tours?  and for the entire trip?
Another great video, but I cringe whenever you dip stuff into raw egg. Ew :D
great video heading to japan in 2 weeks going on a nine day tour with my two daughters I just hope they are not the only 20 somethings on the tour ..your videos are so awesome!
The problem with tour bus is they only give 30 mins. to explore to each and every destination. Nonetheless is it a good experience.
mmm.. so good..
Wow 😍👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 and you're in a good season—the cherry blossom in a full bloom time—in every spot, and true this is a very good route to enjoy Japan for a week!... definitely will check AJT... thank you!
japan is so beautiful everything is so quiet and peaceful, the food looks good, and the temples are soo big. I wish I can be there :(
Hi Angela! Thanks for all the great videos. They are really informative and fun to watch!!!
The quality of the video is really good, what camera are you using?
If I'd be given a chance to go to Japan, I would love to visit Akita prefecture because of the surroundings being picturesque, although I don't specifically know where.
Wow that would be such an intense trip seeing so many places in Japan in such a short amount of time!
This is the perfect trip plans that what I'm looking for!!!!!
Hehe, your tour had a lot of retirees. Which is a good thing lol.
Thank you for the videos! Keep up the great work! The quality is top notch and I appreciate all your work! :)
Hey there Angela yo from akasaka mitsuke!!!!
Yes, sukiyaki is great in a beaten egg!  Actually all the food you ate in this video looked incredible (except that black egg).  Great tour and great video!  I recognized many of those places too... ;)
A good overview of how the tour goes. It did give you a good sample of Japan. did the tour feel rushed?
great video! i miss japan :( .. how did you manage a 8day trip away from work etc? so envious !! love your videos
Oh so that's when you did that live stream from Kiyomizo temple. I'm pretty sure you cheated on the love stone walk by getting directions! Nah, looks like you had lots of fun with some cool sounding peeps on the tour.
Not the worst price for the tour but I prefer experiencing a new culture more independently with more autonomy. Probably would spend more time in Tokyo
I'm going to japan next year and this video, and all the others are so helpful thanks!!!(:
Another great episode! If you don't mind me asking. What are your camera setup? The shots on 13:00 on the flowers looks so nice.
Everything you eat in the video looks so yummy!!! The deers are so cute! Love your amazing high quality videos 👏👏👏
10/10 as content always.
all the views in the video are amazing. and the food 🤤. great video Angela 👍
i wish i was Born in japan!! 😍
Another beautiful and extremely well made video,  well done Angela,
A wonderful video and masterfully presented well Angela. I absolutely love you videos ( and learn a lot) you truly are an amazing woman. Keep it real 😀
I miss Japan very much. I love your video. I would love to do the same itinerary like in this video. It is mainstream but still, I love it ^^
very nice video as always Angela and very interesting too! are all the food including in the price of the tour? 
Nooooo! I am Late :(..you realy went FARRRR away..hence the Skip week in between..i had my eyes out last thusrday*-*
It's like a tutorial video for those who will visit Japan for the first time!! A very helpful guide indeed! Done saving for future purpose ;) Thank you Angela :D Greetings from India~
This makes me even more excited to come to Japan this November! Thank you very much! Is there a place in Japan that gets snow in mid November?
Im going Tokyo first time in June, am excited XD, do you know anyone that does good tours but not over priced?
Very informative. Thanks so much for these :-)
I'm so thankful I stumbled upon your channel awhile ago. So many great videos to help me discover the best parts of Japan when I visit:) thank you!
Why a thumb down? Majide????
Great tips and awesome video. 👌👌
"Look at that big piece of meat" -Angela's friend
Really good list of places! I find Uji is absolutely lovely especially if one could dine at one of the many restaurants along the river :D
I think your cheeks become Chubby than before 😉😉😀😀😀
Whoa! been waiting for this! I hope to see you in personally in Japan, Angela ;-)
have my finals from tomorrow.. but priorities :')

Bad  Conduct. Misleading title.
Do you agree with Skip?
Stop it Skip!
cant compare a 4th option to a legend who was a 1st option!
Skip does not believe what he says. His only goal is to drive up ratings.
Skip Bayless is a damn fool.
I bet I could choose a from of the 90's to beat any of the newer era players.
Draymond isnt even the leader of warriors, hes got 3 better players on his team than him. Charles barkley took his team to the finals. Please put draymond to a medicore team and see how well he does
Skip, are you crazy or just playing stupid?
charles barkley did play with other mvps,:  Hakeem Olajuwon and dr. J
Apparently any of us can can be journalists in this day and age
Sharpe was spot on!
wow..how soon people forget about how good Barkley was..his only downfall was that he played in the Jordan era
They clearly don't drug test at undisputed.
Am I the only one who finds Shannon Sharpe's interjecting comments very annoying?
Well... Green is better than Charles in almost all categories, however, their ability to score on their own separates them too much.... and by end of the day, this is a game of getting BUCKETS !
No. But I love Draymond... Charles Barkley was a perennial all star & MVP caliber player. Unless Draymond leaves and elevates,  I can't say that..  #MichiganLOVE
Draymond Green is not even a top 10 PF of all time
Skip is the least objective basketball analyst to have ever existed.
That pink suit is terrible lol
yea he is so gifted. so hard to pass the ball to steph, klay, or kd let alone make the shot
Is it like a custom to have a pretty girl in the middle of these types of shows...I thought they didnt want to be objectified.
The white unathletic old dude is an idiot...period.
Draymond's defense is much superior to Barkley's, but he is not as much of a threat as Barkley considering Barkley was the only  good person on his team
Barkley didn't have the same 3 superstar team privilege like draymond has.
we wont know till the end of draymond's career
That. Is. A. TIGHT. Pink. Jacket! Still love Shannon!
These players today hate Chuck because he openly declares how garbage they are.
Who did Barkley have? in phenix and 76ers. by the time he got to Huston Clyde didn't want it no more. nether did akeem
SKEEEUUPP is always so calm
Wtf is skip talking about??? Seriously why can't he be suspended for to many stupid things coming out his mouth
lmfaooo this old man has lost his mind
Draymond would average 15/8/5 if he wasn't on the most stacked team of all time... How is that better than Barkley?!?!?!
ever stupid skip bayless! draymond did not carry a team and not even the face of the franchise. and the rule today is so soft. so stupid skip!
Skip is right..I'd rather have green on my team. He cares about winning more than anything.
Blasphemous
Lets talk about this again when Draymond calls it a career. Should be interesting.
lol..... Really Skip!!! Green better than Barkley??? smh &^%$#@ Hater!!! That's all this is!
skip dont realize barkley never had a A1 organization or the personnel,floor spacing draymond has.
W9ooooolow skip sucks
draymond green is a game changer. barkley was never in that league.
Draymond is a good passer but not gifted
Could Greene be a #1  option on a team ? Answer that and you know your answer ! Can he lead a team ? That does not have a Curry or Thompson on the wing ?
I'm starting to believe skip is senile
draymond has never even been a top 25 player in an NBA regular season lmao
Ol' Skip "water pistol" Bayless strikes again...
I'm from Saginaw Michigan I rock with Dray
a better comparison is Shawn Marion.
Shannon is sharp in that suit!
skip is right. Barkley game was painful to watch
Dreymond - has a ring Chuck - no ring
Skip has lost his f@ckin mind!
Skip has to be more objective... its town biniz all da way on mine but Charles barkley was a nightmare to deal with. draymond fits nicely with how the warriors are constructed.
sometimes skip says something.. and i just say YIKES.
skip is stupid he's comparing the 4th best player on his team vs one of the greatest
10ppg Draymond Green better then Charles Barkley lmao no
"Where was draymond game 7"... 32 pts, 15 rebounds 9 assists, the only warrior doing something that game
skip: 'he used the B word' shannon: 'BAWSSS' lol
Barkley is better. Draymond is only better because he has better team with 3 all stars on his team. He has it way to easy. Put him on a team like Mavs to replace Barnes and see what happens
Skip Bayless is on drugs or something cause he not thinking right
"Extreme winners intangibles" wtf is that a fancy way of saying he on a superstar team
Until Dreymond can win League MVP, he and anyone who agrees with him have NO basketball IQ
oMG charles is way better, pls stop here.
Green also has insane basketball iq. Barkley has no championship scorinh alot and rebounding can Cousins to who is Barely allstar, Draymond is better than Davis.
Over the top idiot
Skip is just the perfect troll
skip you have lost it!!!
if draymond played before Charles it would be the other way around cause he played first, so much favoritism smh.
at what... lol. i love shannon
ARE YOU CRAZY SKIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOST ALL RESPECT FOR SKIP! COME ONNNNN
"I don't even know who you are anymore"
SKIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
Draymond is better tho... He knows how to play basketball the right way... When I first seen Draymond at Michigan State I was like damn, this dude is the next Tim Duncan...
I was expecting that Skip will say Draymond is not only better than Charles but also better than Lebron, then continued to say Ray Allen saved LeBron's legacy with that clutch 3 pointer. #Disappointed
Charles was never the #4 option for a team
winners intangibles?! He literally got himself kicked out and missed game 5. Skip just countered his own argument
Wow, not sure I agree with Skip on this one.
skip is  grazy
lol 😂😂😭😭 he said green could of carried the suns to the finals skip u bugging
Draymond green is a system player
Skip is being bias af he has never liked Barkley. Draymond doesn't even come close to him and Charles should be insulted to even be compared to Dronkey.
She acts like people are here for her lol!
I HAVE Chipped a tooth when I was 8 years old

she has a big butt ;-;
you should have put it under water
I kinda cringed when you stuck your fingers in there to open and release. Id be paranoid of getting nipped. heh
Burn it with Fire
the package of that mouse trap simply  means "mouse can come in , but no get out from here" (the white Chinese words translated into English)    that was only a slogan only , marketing , you know 😂
Shawn, the release is poorly designed....
Can you recommend a good rat/rodent trap (maybe this one)?  Give me the link for it on Amazon, and I'll get it that way.
Do not kill the cute mouse. Do you want to be catch
Great Vids Dude Keep Up Te Good Work :)
carry that trap straight into a bucket of water....
do more vids with this trap
That thing is not a humane trap, Asians just like their dinner fresh =)
Do you have anything that would for an attic?
It says In-N-Out
put all of your traps and show how many mouses will u kill
get in without leaving which is its name of the rat trap
Wow those are huge rats. About 5-10 of these traps should do?
Can you do more rat traps?
What do you use as bait?
this is so freaking simple. I'm always amazed by the simplicity and effectiveness of mouse traps
I want to see more RATS caught possibly with the mice traps scaled up to catch the rats also what happened to the botfly you removed from the mouse and allowed to develop do you still have it
You should put all if your traps in the barn together and see which one catches the most mice
pack rats are the only kind of rat i can stomach. I guess that fuzzy tail makes them kinda likeable
you have mice in your barn af
dont understand why live catch traps are called "humane" I think its perfectly humane to kill pests and rodents when they cause trouble
These trap came from Taiwan.
Do you think this might work with squirrels ?
I studied Mandarin and the box clearly states "Dinner for two. Some assembly required".
this could use a couple ventilation holes. im not against any of this, but a live trap should have the animals best interest in mind. other than that, what a nice design!
why would you want to live trap a mouse or a rat?
brutal suggestion...make a timelapse.....mice starved to death
Humane? Since when is causing stress and fear to an animal humane?
http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=81809
yea I wanna see more RATS! big ugly red eyed rats!
i think when your barn run out of rats and mice you should buy ones by the money you earn from the videos! to make sure we watch your videos every monday..
it was made in china, the letters are simplified chinese
here you let the little guy live & still 18 thumbs down lol you would think all the Peta folks would love this
that's one cute rat!
Wow It's from Taiwan.
I think you were supposed to press the tabs that unlock the lid to remove it instead of opening the trap door.
make a new series for rats like... Rat Trap Rundown on Thursdays. Please notice this
these 2 giants actually look cute <3
i ve bought the same long time ago.
Kill the filthy rat F.F.S..
Wash your hands?
this is cheap and unique trap too shawn http://www.ebay.com/itm/Pair-of-Antique-Steel-Traps-designed-to-trap-kill-rats-or-other-small-animals-/382056069949?hash=item58f450fb3d:g:Y0gAAOSwB-1YsOlk
Can you review some snake traps or cockroach trap
The Chinese words at the side says: "Able to go in, not able to go out". You're welcome :)
you should kill the rats and mice never release them
U say u post these vids every Monday but u be posting these on a Sunday 🤔
So many species of rats. Wood rats, black rats, what's next martian rats? Lol
it's Chinese and it's says " you can get in but can not get out "😄
The Chinese says ' (rat) can go in but cannot go out. '
That release system is reeeally bad.
Ordered !!!
It says "Way in, no way out" on the cover.
Great trap!
That rat was shook af 😂😂😂
Didn't care for this trap because you had to stick your fingers into the double doors for release of rat.
This one shows the mouse Mouse trap in Japan
these are chinese means mouse trap mouse can only enter but no way to exit
4:10 You almost lost a finger...
The Chinese said "it can come in, but can't get out"
It'd be awesome if you could have an HD motion camera to record your trap videos.
How about set all the traps and see how many mice or rats youve caught?
The release seems questionable
where is the botfly?
this is what i waiting for, the rat trap, nice trap, where are you buy that asia rat trap ?
what I meant was why won't you make more rat videos?
+shawn woods have you considered making a rat trap video?
Chinese translation: "Easy to get in, Impossible to get out!"
there should be a better option for releasing of mouse.
3:27 2nd mouse: ugh way to go bob
Love your videos Shawn
What ever comes in, can't come out.
so you couldnt read the english either because it says cage type
I honestly really look forward to Mousetrap Monday every week lol. Keep up the great content!
what's up with the maggot?
I think you are mistaken, it's not a mouse trap, it's a chinese sex toy.
you put your hands so close to them.....i swear to god...one day...a rat is gonna bite your hand..give you rabies and die xd
If they already make a humane trap they should give the animal holes to breath on that plastic. That rodent was sweating af in there.
that rat was really sweaty

I have a question did you guys visit Okanawa Japan that you guys didn't vlog
HAPPY JAPANESE PEOPLE SMELL GOOD!?.  HEEEHEEEEHEEEHEEEHEEEHEEEHEEEHEEEHEEHEEHEE!
You cannot eat the peel of the sweet potato, as you cannot eat the skin of kiwi
The sweet potato is 🔥🔥🔥
I was laughing out loud at Chris cause she was so scared. I don't blame her they do get aggressive.
I loved watching Crystal feed the deer!! I was laughing so hard I was crying 😂👌

I don't ear the skin of the sweet potato, I peel it and I dip it to sugar so it doesn't feel/taste dry 
I was there last month and I photographed the deer wading across to that island so no fear they can come and go as they please!

My name is Taylor, I used to live in Texas and I love animals so much! I thought it was a funny coincidence when I found your videos on YouTube hahaha
I would have bought that white ball python in a heartbeat.
I love the  Albino snake
I wanted a hognose when my bearded dragon dies *silently waits 2 years*
Taylor I love your videos your animals are amazing I was wondering if you could do either another feeding animals video or cleaning there cadges xx
would you get a cat next????
i have wanted a dog for 14 years now but i can't get one because my dad doesn't like dogs or any pets so I can't wait to get my own place one day so I can finally get one
I had a dream last night that I was at ur house and you had an eil
Hi Taylor I have a few video ideas  Maybe u could do a video on how to look after your tank when the powers out thanks that would be awesome :)

was about to say, no birds.
You know I've been watching your videos for awhile. I absolutely LOVE your videos.  You really inspire me to work with animals and give them they need.  I wish you and my wonderful pets love from Guam! 🌼❤
taylor why you already got a spooky noodle
Omg Brian is the reason I bought my ball python! It shocked me to see him hahah.
NOOODDDDDLLLLLEEEE #2
dobermans ears are floppy till people crop them.
Ever thought about doing a collab with David dobrik? Lol just like the dude in the beginning of the video
Taylor and Brian in one video so cool :)))))
That white snake was one of the most beautiful snakes I've ever seen 😮😍
the snake's face is kinda weird
I want a western hognose sooooo badly but I live in Illinois :(
Where was this :o and what is this pet expo called I want to go!
Omg you look so different when you smile. I am so used to your neutral face. Glad to see you enjoying yourself it looks fun!
*omg i am soo mad with her now i want a snake lol love u*
can you please please please so a video on care and basics for a blue tongued sking....  I really want to look into getting one. and would love to hear your advise.
Can you try to make a video all on your experience with being bit by your currently owned animals, does it hurt? And how often do they bite. It'll be really helpful
When I said blank I meant blabbing on
that white snake is gorgeous
HAMSTER!!!!
Did you go to the one in California ?? Because I went their on Sunday
Your videos get better every time I watch them! This pet expo looks amazing!
That snake boy tho
That white snake was SO pretty
If you don't name the new snake pepperoni pizza i will be severely disappointed
Wait, is it an armadillo?
You support that idiot? You should do some research. Lol. He's a piece of scum.
parrot owner of five here 👌 all rescues. I loved how informative the parrot station was. because they are the type of animal people get on a whim which makes them end up being rehomed over and over.
I'm so upset! I thought I saw you there but I wasn't sure it was you ;-; I should've said hi
Name it Phoenix
I Love You Taylor.  😘
I think you should name the snake Pumpkin, or Buttercup! Ps I <3 u and your videos!
Hi, I have an important hedgehog question, I know your not a vet but I love your videos and your knowledge is awesome. is there someway of contacting you?
I'm from Texas and I won't to win a Betta
can to alabama pls
are you gonna make anymore videos with gus
marry me plz :)
Hognoses are great I have an albino hognose and I get it as my third snake!
Omg! hog noses are so cute! I want one 😣
so what are you going to name your hognose? maybe hades because of the colouring of fire? :) btw 11:42 is clearly the Kanye of the dog world :')
You said your bad with meeting people but in that video you were so nice!!!!!!!!!! Also, can you make a video to convince my parents in getting me a snake??
omg paige i always watch prestons channel so im like woahhh 😂😂
*picks up frog*  me: IT'S SLIPPY!!!
Brian is an awful person, and animal abuser. this is really disappointing to see you sponsor him on your channel
Hey Taylor! I have a name suggestion for your snake. How about the name omelette! I think it goes with toast and cheese so yeah! Omelette the snake!
I wonder what type of cat is he
Not a cat person but that was the cutest cat ever.
he  is so cuteeeeee
she lost weight like crazy !!
i love cats so much i almost started to cry when he meowed😭
My cat would just chill in the pouch completely still all day. She always wants to be carried anyways.
you have a cute dogge
Cats shed like that when they are terrified. A cat more chill with people should have been chosen.
Aw, is this your dog?
"Is this your dog?" Got me dying
I feel like this will work better with a kittens
"aww is this your dog?"  me: Looks at the camera with a disappointing face like in The Office
yes. this is the type of content we need
omigosh riceball is the most fabulously adorable name
UGH YES FINALLY A VIDEO ABOUT RICEBALL
Isn't Riceball Iris's cat ? Lol
today on buzzfeed: cat torture
Where can you buy those sweatshirts I need it for reasons
I'm forever naming my future pet Riceball, I don't care if it isn't white
I need one of these hahaha but my cat's fur is light colored, sooooo black sweaters aren't great... lol
Wait is that the same girl from the April 2016 video? (People taking cats) Omg thats amazing she lost so much weight! Good for her she looks so much better now :) Glad to see people trying to improve their health.
She looked like Louise from bob's burgers when she had the hood on
i love cats
1:46  Idk, my faith was kind restored in tan
Every single time when a person gives me something  " Wtf... Is it my birthday "
you have a damn chill cat. my cat would fight me just to get in it.
1:54 the man was like.. can I eat it?
what kind of cat is that
Awww, Such a cute cat and the name rice ball :D
I WANT RICEBALL!!!!!!
i would use it to hold my wine bottle
but....where did it use the bathroom
The dose of quality content, of course.
OHHHHHH she said SHEDDING!! I thought she said, he is sh**ting everywhere, 😂😂😂
WAIT! Didn't Riceball belong to someone else in an older video?? I believe it was the video of People trying to walk their cats Or is it just me lmao
i thought it said "i married my cat like a kangaroo for a day"
"aww is that your dog?"
Whats next put your puppy in a nest like a bird for a week
everytime I watch cat videos I feel the need to go find my cat, and play with her haha
at one point my family had a cat who would have loved this sweater, I kinda wish I had it when she was around..
I can see myself wearing the sweater with my future cat, dog, or rabbit
Didn't this cat have a different Asian owner
My cat would put up with this for about two seconds.
Damn buzzfeed is dying
riceball is ADORABLE <3 no cat would like that especially if they're outside w/dogs and loud noises. I like his unique name.
HES SO CUTE I
It would be much easier for him if you had used the drawstring to help hold him in. It is there for a reason.
Wait if you go to the video "People Try Walking Their Cats" There is a Riceball "Look alike"
Riceball is soooo cute!!
wouldnt work for me  my cat is nearly 30 pounds
I want to carry a bunch of kittens in that pouch omg
"Aw is this your dog?" "Sheila that's a cat"
"Is that a chicken?"
I accidentally clicked on this video but im glad i did...
And this is what happens when buzzfeed runs out of ideas Next video: I try holding in my pee for a day     this comment is a joke.
is it just me or has buzzfeed changed their video format... I don't like it
I got a cat pouch sweater for my bday!! Except mine is grey. And my cat actually loves it. He has arthritis in his hips and he's alil chubby so I guess he enjoys not walking.
LOL my dog is too fat for this -_-
technically, anyone could afford a house similar to this. It would just be much smaller and more compact. you wouldn't have to buy groceries and you would save so much.
Me: *remembers riceball in the other video* Me: MANDALA EFFECT
Didn't Riceball have a different owner in the walking your cat video?
Why. Why must my eyes be cursed with this.
that's one chill cat
Adorable! That pouch is best for like kittens or something and needs more support.

Does anyone know what breed Riceball is?
cats are evil but this cat seems acceptable
'aww this is your dog?!'
what breed is it please answer
That is not a cat. That is a sausage!
this fuckin youtube channel destroys my brain cells
What cat breed is that 🐱🐱
Yeah, this would be impossible to do with my cat. She's a very moody and independent kitty and hates being held. 😂
Alex: What're you doing?  Also Alex: *still pets the cat*
everything should be under 'buzzfeeds running out of ideas'
jared's face is everything at the beginning
IS female cat easier to handle
omg what kind of cat is that 😊😊😊😊❤❤❤
I like your cat.
Gale from Bob's Burger would wear that.
Aww is this your dog!?
RICEBALL IS A MUNCHKIN XO
Aww another girl used to own Riceball in a video where they tried walking their cats. She adopted him!
WASN'T RICEBALL SOMEONE ELSE'S CAT if i recall in like "people try walking their cats for a day"
my cats would kill me if even tried to do this
That cat is sooooooo cute
these machines are so calm and beautiful. world seems to be very peaceful in this video. i wish i would in late 80s period
cool vid n awesome inventions 😃
the cat thing is slower than walking lol
what is invented?  just catch a real Tiger and ride it
can you give me that robot
wow.. keren
choti car khn se mily gi. kisi ko pta h...??? uski price kia h what price of small car...???
I want squidward's bike
that coconut opener is made to open asses wider
i like bicycles
And there's a team of scientists trying to create a cheetah robot
Yo can I get the bike thing from the 2nd clip shown

o sir India is no 1 for jugaad
6:08 INDIA ...
6:31 is of vietnam
5:23 it was really good enjeneyring...
your 3rd bloody invention of opening coconuts have been used in Kerala,  India for generations...  grow up
wow! what an invention lion walks like turtle. :p
8:00 Jajajajajajaja
those all are best
those all are best
the third invention "the coconut opener" is not a invention of 2017. I am using it more than 20 years...
7:59 ultimate war starting
coconut peeler is not homemade it is in our home we buy it
your lion is too slow.
The car is  amazing I was thinking if the refugees in Europe used this instead of walking large distance and get diseases it will be a great idea
Sounded like hey soul sister
Very nice 😎
the boat and the small car are amazing👍👌👌
love the video hate this stupid whimsical music... makes me feel like every little thing is gonna be alright... but its not!!!
thumbnail at 5:48  good to cool but shit for travel

This chicken thought "waht is going on here.?😂😂😂
the guy with the canoe bike forgot to our fishing pole holders on his rig
wowow amazing I like for today
Great video. Excellent presentation. Well done!
Send me one and I will test it thoroughly, sounds like a super cap.
it was about time. previous smartphone batteries sucked ass... .
The working is in the substructure make up of the glass.
Phones will be the same, they will hold the charge 1-2days. They just will be thinner. Thanks marketing bigheads....
OMG Tesla model 4, 5400km range O.O. That would freak out petrol heads. (tesla 100D has 540km range, so times 10...)
It is not April 1st.
Can you link to patent ? Is it public ? I have some base knowledge to check if this can work.
it wont be avalible anyway. rich people wont allow it
Any more bad battery jokes and i will have to Charge you for Solariciting  : )
It will be a great, proven concept once a practical sample exists in reality. Until then, another science experiment with a lot of mathematical claims.
Johnny B. Goodenough!
3-10x the charge would make electric air travel feasible. that said, almost every new battery development ever reported on could have "3-10x the charge".
Superior white people - Truly a gift to all mankind.
"Surprise firework show in your pants" lol
Before I watch it, is it graphene?
Go to Hollywood dude you the geek look totally down man!
there called super capacitors nothing new there down fall is how exspensive they are to produce.. that's probly what he patented is a more cost effective production method..
I want one.
Love all the pseudo-science remarks in the comments.
sounds good to me
I dunno why but everything about this video seems like it's coated in clickbait and bullshit. Maybe it's the video format or the title? Or maybe that last name Goodenough (which is apparently a legit last name.)
"But why is this good?" "It's got Electrolytes!"
This would be really great for vapes
Watch Exxon buy it out and bury it like they did the aluminum-air battery.
holy sh1t!!!!!!
Holly crap, you just opened my eyes,  Calling the city to change my name tomorrow, mine is just not Goodenough!
Great. Looks like my girlfriend wont be needing me for a very long time.
Ohhh. subbed for the ears.
It's got what plants crave...
Big battery will buy it out we'll never see it
I blame that Portuguese lady for faking this, they're always bullshitting about free energy bs
its got what plants need?
0:09 That wasn't good enough for John B Goodenough.
I'm ready to buy this tech for my quadcopters
SHUT_UP_AND_TAKE_MY_MONEY-meme.png
i am hopeful... this will make exo-skeletons more practical too :)
-4°F??!!! In a car???!!! It would never work in a car in the winter in the north of the US or Canada or anywhere north really. It will get to -20°F or more most of the time in winter.
Goodenough made 2 battery development changes in one life, its goodenough :)
umm? perfect for cars? where I live I would only make it to work half the time in winter. not goodenough cold weather performance.
to bd it dose not work in out weather over 70 degree
Stop the puns
I like everything in my existence to be electric... Except my car.
acts more like a capacitor, but with different materials involved.
From 2:00 to almost 2:20 could have been left out. Its either common sense or gets a little philosophical which doesn't help the presentation.
maybe it works more like a capacitor. rather then storing electrons in the valance shells. the elctrons are placed around the surface. (an overly simplified explanation)
Cool new look bro
I say true because he is already known for his battery work
But can it handle higher discharge rates like LiPo batteries we use for hobby use?
There is an Old Saying ? If it sounds to good to be true  ? Well you know the rest of this saying ? Just Saying LOL
Hmm for as much as I want to believe this news even if it's from a reliable source. I fear I need to see a live demonstration of it out for all to see before I give any final opinions about it.
Cu+2     Cu+1 = 1 eV
What about nuclear batteries?
Is it actually going to be useful in any way so that it will eventually make it's way into phones this time?
Li-Ion King, enough of these puns 😂😂
For John B. Goodenough it wasn't good enough :D
SHIPSTONES!  Heinlein told you they were coming. ;)
Yeah, whatever awesome invention we had, when money comes into the picture, someone is bent on monopolizing it...
energy is a form of matter and matter can't be created out of nothing.
"...Has Experts Stumped"  Oh fucking STOP IT!
It is very very much the real deal....
None of this works at all that way son.  You need to study some of this before making videos.   These are alternate facts....
When will this battry be availible?
please... no more puns
I am not sure I believe this... A old guy making a revolutionary battery and he is called Goodenough? No, sorry. Nice try.
I wonder if Tesla looking at these for his gigaplant
I need that shirt in my life!!
i'm sorry i had to put a thumbs down for the very poor explanation this "amateur" presenter explained (and totally confused) a standard battery principle with the rechargeable batteries principle.
i really hope it is true, having sodium instead of lithium would be great and could make the availability of this ever greater battery absurd.
that pun lol
will this work in my woof woof dog ?
King Crimson, the battery.
Realistically, how long should we expect it to be until we have significantly better batteries available in products we buy?
I can believe that until the government buys him out and destroys the patent
WHITES ARE THE BEST INVENTORS OF ALL TIME.
oh my god! finally they made a new animal crossing video. it has been so long since the last one. geez i have to go back and watch them right now.
It's criminal that y'all at DYKG still haven't done an episode covering either Bioshock or Dead Space. Pretty please.
the animal in the first on e that was cut is in the n64 one
Anybody know what the song used in the outtro is?
Ahhhh the feels....... this was great. My fav AC even over the greatness of New Leaf, is the GameCube one. That music is SO GOOD and the randomness and feistiness of some of the villagers is gold.
"This means they could be potentially impossible for a 3-fingered animal to play" -- Or, you know, being an animal alone would make it impossible to play the song on guitar. But whatev...
makes me wanna play new leaf again thanks for this vid guys
Totally stopped playing because of Mr. Resetti. Young me was more sensitive than I am.
2:42 Gulliver was so surprised that he talked in English
"this means they can be potentially impossible for a 3 fingered animal to play." how about just the fact that he's an ANIMAL hahah
I realized you're now re-harshing older videos. I thought I was going crazy.
Did you know gaming on Left 4 Dead 1 & 2 pls.
Spends 2 minutes talking about a song.... never plays the song in the video.
How many times can I hear about the alien broadcasts in these kinds of lists before I'm no longer disturbed?
There are midi guitars out there too, although they are quite rare from what I can tell.
I feel like they've make this video before
This game is lame
3:00 They technically have Miis in the game due to the Mii mask item. Looks OK IMO.
Hey i do videos like this
But some of those are very US based ... and aren't celebrated, or celebrated on different dates in other countries (7:00)
In France, Isabelle is called Marie because it's the anagram of "Maire" which means "Mayor"
That would only be a "watermill" if there was a flood with an extremely high water mark...
Some of the facts were reiterated, but still new info is nice info
Jesus is there any Nintendo game that wasn't planned for the N64DD at some point?
C H U G G A A
Anyone else show this game to their mom and then she take over their save file?
You guys should do a special video for totakas song
4:01 actually, it's pronounced "palan-keen" - connie maheswaran 2k17
make them young girls cry
You guys should do did you know kindergarten
Instead of playing a human villager, how about we get to create our own animal villager. Base template, choose the eyes, mouth, etc and the color pallet?
Finally. How have you guys not made one for this game already???
Do Scarface the world is yours! That game was awesome
"Mr. Resetti's abrasive nature actually made some young players cry." Yeah, I was one of those. 6 years old on the GameCube. It got to the point where I was scared to even turn the game on.😂
hahaha yes, i did, all of it, best saga in the world
how do u do the cylinder thing?
did you know marvel vs capcom
Glad i could help with some footage of the 3DS version! I gave you a Sub! nice video!
5:03 MY GOAL IS REACHED!!! Thank you for showing my found easter egg in your video :))) OMG i am so happy. :)))))))
8:47 You forgot one thing... economy.
Make DYK LittleBigPlanet!
why haven't u guys done half-life?
You mean to tell me a 3 fingered dog playing 4 finger chords on a guitar is impossible?
There is actually an instrument called a midi guitar which translates guitar playing into midi. So it is entirely possible that he used one to code in KK's song
What's the best animal crossing game? And is it worth buying?
Everyone's whining that he said cone instead of cylinder, but at 7:40 he calls a windmill a watermill.
I would be pissed if they went through with replacing the AC characters with miis
To this day, I still wonder WHO OWNS THIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL???
I hope nintendo is developing animal crossing for the switch. That would be so amazing! I want it so badly :(
Wait... Are you telling me...MY DOG CAN'T PLAY GUITAR!?!
I can't be the only one whose basement in the original was an NES game room.
this video was so nice and peaceful! what a nice thing to watch after a long day
I think it would be cool if you made a video about the Witcher video game series some time in the future.
Is it just me or is animal crossing sooooo boring. I'd rather play the sims. Waste of 30$ imo
the television show with people doing sports and stuff isnt just in japan
Anyone else still playing the game?
Plz help me to 10 subs
No yeah it's definitely the fingers limiting the dog from playing the guitar
not really into animal crossing but fun facts anyway
9:13 The angry squid watches while you sleep.
2:19 RIP my first town in Wild World, taken too early due to seeding.
The original game had the best music; catchy and charming. New Leaf's music by comparison is dead, uninspiring, and entirely forgettable.
I'm getting my daily new leaf stuff while watching this video. :D
Ha! PBG's footage showed up!
Its funny how Did You Know Gaming talks about how the dog needs four fingers the play certain tones on the guitar while it only has three fingers.  Never mind that a talking dog is playing a guitar in the first place.
Didn't they already make this video?
I used to reset on purpose just to see all of the things Resetti would say, lmaooo. He hated me xD Sometimes I really miss the simplicity of the Gamecube game.
The next game would be human crossing
What do you say to Tom Nook?         YOU GREEDY DIRTBAG
fuckers renamed Christmas "toy day"........
That was not a transition.
lol you're all talkin about KK"s slider amount of fingers and playing his guitar based off that. He has no thumbs lol, why would you bring up the fingers topic >.>
My new lead still doesnt have the update to decorate the villegers houses :l wtf
you spent so much time talking about music and that hidden song but never actually played it. wtf lol
I'm the only person on the planet who has never played one of these. :<
"Potentially impossible for a 3 fingered animal to play" - Yah don't say....shocked!
I noticed that there was some shesez footage. I'm glad he's doing well on his channel
I read that once you start animal crossing on the GameCube, you can actually take the disc out, because the file size of the game is so small that the entire game will fit into the Gamecube's RAM
they used footage from PBG <3
"This means they could be potentially impossible for a 3-fingered animal to play." Uh... As opposed to...
I swear I saw this s few years ago but it only just came out.
Everytime he said "City Folk" I just kept saying "Let's Go To The City" and YES! I know the name differences
Animal Forest seems like a much better game title than Animal Crossing… Any idea why they changed it outside of Japan?
I have the iQue and I want to get games for it. I do I get games for it? Is it even possible?
This guy is too much of a racist.'blacks this' 'black that'
"Whites don't want war" who told you?
This is fake don't believe it.
fake news everything fake
fuck your title ..... do proper research and stop your subjectivity...
This is "Fake news". It's a service delivery protest. NOTHING RACIAL ABOUT THAT!
What's all this "punish the Jew" rubbish ?  It's nothing to do with Jews, educate yourself, don't fall for that old poisonous lie.
nee thom jy bly in n vokken droom wereld....nobody wants a war only a very few people HATEs the opposite race..
Jews are behind all of this???? Jinne, you guys must have a very good imagination.
this guy talking is shit...Pure shit
who the fuck do these blacks think they are
please stop talking like youre a text-to-speech bot
the whites, the blacks... No, change that. Say African or something. Cool channel otherwise
The SPCA gets upset when chickens die, but nobody blinks an eye when the whites are being systematically exterminated.... What a world we live in!
BANNED from youtube!!!
dont cry now you are the fukker that votes for the anc😅😅😅
Wow this comment section is getting shilled hard. "Everything is okay goyim, this guy is just a paranoid lunatic, trust (((me)))!"
Safety in numbers is an illusion...
Mxm no news here!!!
no probs m8 when we will be done with north korea we will wipe zuma out of this planet for things like this
need to start culling.
I lived in a communist country and I dont understand why ANYONE would want to live through that willingly. Ok, so everyone knows what's coming, what do we do about it?
u white cowards ;roltect your famiys
Burn, break and steal, this will help your cause
READ PSALM 37 SOUTH AFRICA!!!
Come together in peace and love or burn in hate and fear your choice but your all running out time the shift has begun
Thank you Jan.
Why do you put valse information on social medai, what did you gain thru this video?This was not war against white and black.
lol lotsa hooknoses in the comment section on this one... and the video is having issues loading for me (on your .com as well)
If you still think It's a black and white war you are lost.. it's us against the government you fools
Shouldn't have settled there in the beginning.
love is the key to happiness.
woooooooow  to much hate.
All of these race arguments (from all sides) are simply retarded.
its happening
Don't forget the horrific murders of White farmers and ranchers because the ANC is trying to kill ALL of the Whites.
Jewish financed terrorism.   Jew's hate blacks but use them as tools for white genocide
Did you see what happened in Bloem this past Saturday? God is much greater and bigger than the fear that you what to spread.
holy crud man... you really do need to get a life. Use this energy and go do something good instead of spreading fear and hate.
ur presentation is stupid because it clearly shows dat u have picked a side of the story at hand y nt jst look at the other side as-well? no-wonder u have less likes and views.
Excellent presentation like always.
Germany will awaken not so long from now. Germany will retake Namibia and then it will be the end of the ANC, and be in early stages of WWIII. Whites must stay out of harms way, savages will savage their own in the end.
When Blacks act up -- punish the Jew. When Liberals act up -- punish the Jew. When Commies act up -- punish the Jew.
It really scares me to see how many white people have no weapons.  Anything will do.
And the solution is the same as always:  death to traitors, expel invaders.
Agree with krew666666. Why are the whites just sitting back?? We should start fighting back. The Suidlanders warned us years ago about this. We should start taking them seriously. This is war people.
hey, lovely vid
thats the best thing when you keep your own things in years
ZWEIBRUCKEN! I lived there as a kid right before they closed the base.
I'm so happy for him god bless this man
What a good old fella that was.
And people say Rolex is expensive.
Keep all your paperwork everyone!
When people say "Why would you ever buy a Rolex (or any other high end watch) when my $20 Casio keeps better time (which it may).    show them this.
He better call up his old Sergeant (if he isn't six feet under) and offer him a steak dinner and a night's worth of beer for that sage advice!
Over a months pay in the military? Try over a years worth.
Rolex prices for second hand just rising 8-12% every year..
Nice old guy.
I don't usually buy a watch but when I do, I keep everything that comes with it!
nowadays it would take 3 years of not spending my entire salaries just to buy a ROLEX
He should've had the man sit down before telling him that! He looked ready to keel over. What a pleasant shock! Bless him!
how come its not swiss made?!!?? is it a fake watch???
And just like me, he's wearing a Casio.
What a sweet old man. I'm happy for him.
I'm looking at my Casio and sighing disappointedly.
man his reaction is the best
hehe dont give him a heart atack now
A pity watches are obsolete now.
I would say that since this watch is owned by a veteran that defended our country, it's worth even more.
I hope that he kept it to pass onto posterity.
65 000 biltemakorvar ...
One of the best feel good videos on YouTube. Brilliant.
Why am i WATCHing this?
I wanna know if he soled it !
How great <3
Wow, the look in his face is priceless.
thank you for your service in WW II!
His watch must have some sort of sentimental value to him, whether that's worth more than $70k is up to him haha. Whatever he decides to do with it he deserves it :)
The army veteran deserves it after all the strife he endured. I feel happy for this man :)
perfect movie how corporations can do everything to get  stronger, its all directed
I'm blown away people actually get rid of the pox/papers. Good for him - he deserves every penny and more.
lucky man. im glad he never had a garage sale ;)
useless old junk. got time on the cell phones now.
he was hoping it might be a bit more
not a sweeping hand, fake.
damn that is a good return for a watch he didn't even use any more.
he has Casio Watch now 😀 cheap watch
Adjusted for inflation, $120 in 1960 is equal to $984 dollars in 2017.
Deserves every penny. thank you for your service, sir.
"If you would've told me 1500 I would've been happy"  aaaaaand cue tears.
looks like he was about to cry or something
He deserves it. So happy for him :)
If my lip reading is as accurate as I think it is, I believe the old man whispered  BS at the 3:10 mark.
I always keep the receipt and box for my fake jordans
Rick from Pawnstars.   Well you see I gotta frame it and it'll sit on the shelf for years. I'll give you 250 bucks. Cash.
GOOD! Its awesome when good things happen to great people! Have fun matey!
Not a lot of people even wear watches these days. Some do but not like before.
this gave me chills.
thats it? i was hoping for like a million
wonder how much he ended up getting for it
I think it will cost millions
I thought he was going to have a heart attack.
What a nice man! I genuinely wish him the best :)
Was that considered a smooth-sweeping movement in the 60's?
The reflection of the blue stand is really throwing this off - too bad.  I'm kinda surprised it is "sports" watch from back then but I guess it was the first.  The beginning of the decline in luxury watches.
this makes me so happy
that's incresible
Ha! Zweibrücken. Thats close to where I grew up!
Keep it in your family my man!
I was so glad he didn't have a heart attack!
Good for him! Now he can get more Charlie Brown shirts!
Simply amazing.
"probly more then a months pay in the military right now" uh yeah... by a lot.
talk about a dress up watch lol
shows up at pawn stars...yea ill give you $200 LUL....
A man who served his country deserves that nice to see and hear.
This guy seriously looks like he could be a long lost brother to famous dutch writer Harry Mulisch.
doesnt sell the watch  classic old guy
Homeboy is about to have a heart attack
.....and if he were on Pawn Stars, they would immediately say, "We'll give you $1500 for it." LOL
Anyone else get this recommended? Pretty cool video!
Hey fella, want to buy a watch.  I'll let you have it at a steal, only $65k.
I love this old man!!
wow , i like this kind videos
my dad and mom were there in zweibroken , germany at that time.. both my bros are born in germany!
I was stationed in NYC in 1986. Stainless steel Rolex Submariners were advertised at $975
Well this was a cute old man
Cool for him...sad that there are enough people with that much money to throw away on something so benign when most people struggle to afford their rent or mortgage.
That appraisal guy is an idiot... He shoulda told him privately its worth 3K, offered him that, and then auctioned it off.... Trumps America!
I wonder if there's more old people out there who would sell me their old Rolex watches
United just got roasted!
did Emirates, just made the dab at 0:22 ?.
5 years ago we were travelling with emirates to dubai and our tickets were overbooked but instead of getting kicked out of the plane we got buisness class tickes!!! Respect !!
THAT IS SAVAGE!
Who's the girl at :27?
Emirates is savage!!!
Just another reason for extending cabotage rights to foreign airline.
Shots fired ohhhhhhhhh
for the right amount of commission I can definitely promote you.
Thank you emirits now I feel very poor but I'm proud!
Hmm I made a motto for united : "If we don't beat out competitors we beat out passengers" XD
emirtes is my favrite ariline
This isn't competiton. It was battle
Do not seem to hire Arab women
U sure?Qatar is gonna be the Next
You go emirates. Feed off this meme
Emrites "we give you the rites (rights) to stay at your own seat"
Ya know I feel a lot more comfortable here. These people are family friendly
It's funny how the guy was kicked off cause the flight was over boarded and now they probably wouldn't be able to fill up half the seats.
yup united (nope) they should be unmanly airlines
United got toasted
Why did i click on an an ad?
Emirates Airlines: Board as a Doctor, Leave as a Doctor.
Title Should be called  Emirates Airline (Diss Track)
i thought it said united airlines, such a click bait
Emirates, we beat the customers, not you - United Airlines
Shots fucking fired
United,  Delta, American all suck very bad compared to Emirates,  Lufthansa,  Virgin, and even value jet.
shameless i love it they are the best no doubt
oh no  not again
When u fuck up badly
Will this fly into the Trump tower.
No thanks. The thought of a naked lady already sends me flying.
After this, United is going to start offering guaranteed seats without beatings.  For a premium.
No over booked seating!? You won't beat the shit out of me???
this is basically punching united in the face and then dragging them out of business
Yeah....this is something that would trend....
Lol 😂 the Middle East airlines are killing it first Pakistan International airlines now emirates
they better have good food... united airlines food tastes like they hired cops to drag it down the isle to your seat.
BURNED!!!!!
any other airline slogan, "we greet, we seat you, we treat you... and we make sure not to beat you"
Emirates airlines will always be the best
I flight with Etihad and they are really really good. Looking forward to try the Emirates also :)
Mlg version on my channel. CHECK IT OUT FOR FREE FOOOOD!
Mlg version on my channel. CHECK IT OUT FOR FREE FOOOOD!
Fly the FRIENDLY sky.... I see some shade right there
Nobody seems to notice that 0:27 is Alexandra Daddario
OHHHHHHHHHN REKT
They saw the chance AND THEY TOOK IT
Legends.... but still Ryanair all the way ;D
Can't say I've flown Emirates before, but i really want to on my next trip just because of how savage this ad is
At least it's not United.
United Airlines is Crap, they dragged & threw my dog off somewhere in the Amazon Jungle because the pet section was overbooked.
United Airline's name is being dragged through the ground...
Taking shots at United huh??? How about you just calm down.
United airlines is triggered
So if I get on there I WONT be dragged violently off?
DANG EMIRATES WANTS A FIGHT
This is what oil money gets you
No thanks, I only fly with humans.
one way ticket to Hong Kong is 28,000.
Can't support any company that comes out of that country personally.
better than united airlines xD
What if it showed a fat flight attendant?
Honestly, you guys are just awesome for doing this 😂
this is the level of salty I wish to be
anything beats United....
Petty....... just after That United Airline thing😂 smart doe
Im supposed to be visiting my cousin but this one airline keeps dragging me off.
i thought this was a meme but then i saw the name of the youtuber.
So you telling me I haven't been on a proper airline??
Emirates customer service is great, YOU CAN'T BEAT IT.
Lol, we don't have competition, WE ARE THE COMPETITION!
I love flying Emirates. They gave me this free pizza in a small box and it was already hot right when I took it out. It was so good! I love EMirates!
The friendly skies are finally here
I travel 3 times a year, back and forth, and I always take Emirates. Best airlines
Emirates is the BEST!! 2nd time flying with this airline.
Fly the friendly skies...  This time for REAL
Good move, Emirates, good move
Emirates blows, still waiting on them to respond to my complaint letters after being bumped for more than 40 hours years ago

Been a samsung user since forever!!! Samsung, you never fail me! 😍
Does it come with the explosion feature in case of emergency?
We're living in the future!
Lamest intro ever. They make you feel like zombie.
SAMSUNG IS THE WORST!!!!!!   APPLE IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!
They sell phones that they go to the cold store they buy it then sell it for us
samsung is rhe worst. I THINK THEY DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT EARPODS MEAN....
GUYS DONT JUDGE SAMSUNG
it has a it has a headphone jack and it still waterproof
It seems amazing!
nokia still the best
This Times Samsung  Made the perfect smartphone !!!♥
The S8 is going to be Samsung's most successful high-end smartphone in their history, even though i'm an iPhone user...I know when I see a winner!
Chech it out-http://riffhold.com/1E5b
but,does it explode
i love you samsung your the king
I'm using an S8 right now but one day, I might get this phone.
why does this have so many less views than the s7 one did right away and why does the "this is a phone" video have more?
buy the coolest case for your Samsung Phone/tablet on: https://www.wish.com/merchant/obinaposhboutique  SORRY TO DISTURB
And then iPhone 8 came and sold millions of phones :)
the main. differences between Samsung and Apple Samsung still uses a headphone jack thank god Samsung allows you to comment on their videos and Samsung doesn't make irrelevant adverts
Does this one explode?
should I be worried about the restarting issue ? I am going to buy an s8+ exynos tomorrow
iphone is sweating profusely
unbeliveblely amazing
vlogging with your front cameta ... worst thing in the hole life  bad focus 😷
this mobile had already defeated Apple and samsung had invented the best phone ever
Does it have WhatsApp?
When will it hit the market?
Amazing, amazing, amazing... but i thought the screen is see through, i guess not. (next big idea for the company)
I'm watching this on a Samsung s7 lol
Hey! I heard somewhere you can use the s8 as a drawing tablet for your computer/TV. Does anyone know something about this!?
another piece of trash‥
Did you notice that in the minute 2:9 he wanted to open the phone with a fingerprint and that he could not because of the big phone to his hand if you see it give #Like
That is SAMSUNG... smooth in beginning after few months its going lags,  The power of andriod, LOL..

Hey guys! Subscribe to my channel for upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 videos and get a chance to win a possible Galaxy S8 GIVEAWAY!

i feel happy watching this wonderful video , this is my future phone 😍💜💜.
Got the "Orchid Grey" Galaxy S8! Best design & device that I own so far hehe!!
I think iPhone is in trouble lol
I'm watching this on s8 there brill
I was just about to buy the iphone....
8k apple fan boys already disliked it...
1 more month till i get this phone. Bye bye iphone 5s
Samsung s8 is way better then iPhone 7 plus
Watching this on my s3 neo . *cries*
best ad ever...ive almost cried seeing this masterpiece
Proud to be a Samsung user :) I'm allergic on apples ( On phones and fruits also😅)
Buying this because of stranger things 1:02 bye
I like Samsung, my first phone was a Samsung but I like the look of the iPhone more. If they made a phone with the display of an iPhone and tech from Samsung I would be happy.
Plus? Seriously? Jesus you can't even think of a name by yourselves..........
Who else is watching this on the S8?
i wonder if its better than Sony Xperia XZ Premium
oh god please give samsung a brain why u still thinks we need beauty face mode ? horrible idea
Why would they leave out a USB type C for this product? That is pretty damn annoying!
I just bought a surface pro 4 recently, thinking microsoft wouldn't release a pure laptop. Should i sell the surface pro 4 and get this? how do they compare?
I am very confident with MS, my Surface Book is truly a productivity and entertainment dream come true for my life!
"But it will only take one failure to know them back to the bottom"? When did this happen? Microsoft and Apple stocks are at all time high and have been rising steadily since 2010. Somebody's not doing their research.
A laptop with carpet built in.... interesting
would have bought this with a I5 8gb ram and 128ssd with windows 10 no S. a little over priced for the S version, know the upgrade is free or $49 but ram is lacking
looks like Mac.
THIS LOOKS EPIC! WOW! Apple has really dropped the ball after their failed MacBook Pro 2016... I am in the market for a MacBook but might now wait... Wow. this is AMAZING!
Can I get iTunes and Chrome on this?
wow comparing to a laptop that is like 2 years old.
simplicity is the ultimate sophistication, thanks for the review
so i'm i the only one that heard: "and it also has a f*cking new mouse..." at 1:18
Still NO USB C Thunderbolt 3!!!!  First Surface Studio and now this one...... Keep ignoring it Microsoft... NEXT!
Interesting !!
holy shit that mouse cost 80 bucks...r u serious😂😂
exactly ,it's a "product". nothing special or exciting.
This product is a disgrace. It's not user-friendly to have touch screen on a folding laptop, the felt keyboard is dumb, and the product is priced high with a 4GB RAM in its base model.../MacBook Pro all the way
So I have a question.. I really just bought the Surface Pro 4 3 days ago...  What's the difference here? Did I make a mistake? I'm a student...
if this had a 1080p screen. for even better battery life. 8gb ram, i7 7500u, 940mx, up to 2tb nvme ssd, easy open chasis for fan cleaning. with 10 hour battery life, I would so buy this
ugh this is so sexy I wish I can return my 2016 15 inch MacBook
Did anyone else think he said "They also have a fucking new mouse" instead of "funky"?
For college students at USD999? That's terribly expensive, it's a joke
Look at this mouse designed by Microsoft and look at the mouse designed by Apple, Apple's mouse is ridiculous. Microsoft, Google and Samsung are way ahead of Apple, but sheeples don't like them.
that premium's purely for the microsoft name isn't it?
THEY COULDN'T ANNOUNCE THIS FIVE MONTHS EARLIER WHEN I BOUGHT MY XPS 13?!!!
"It comes with Windows 10 S. The S coming from the world of cars, a nod to the luxury of Mercedes S class". HAHAHAHHAHA WTF! So being limited to the Windows Store is a nod to luxury? You may as well give me cancer!
I'm gonna be honest. My main electronics are Apple as I'm a huge Apple fan. But MS really kicked Apple's ass past couple of years.
That shit sexy wow
No 15 inch variation , common I would've bought it if it had a bigger display
hopefully can dual boot windows 7
I'm glad to see competition for Apple here because it means lowers prices and higher quality in the future products of both companies
Windows 10 S for Surveillance and only apps from the MS store on a cripple version of windows and only 4GB ram. Yep it's not good value or a full laptop. It's a Chromebook from MS but many times more expensive!
i never thought that Microsoft icon can look ths much better 😍
4 GB of RAM for $1000? Fuck you!
It remind me "Surface RT"
Why did you compare the new Surface Book with the old MacBook Air instead of the new MacBook early 2016?!
but does it run chrome?
That weird fabric covering and 4GB RAM are deal breakers.
wtf up with cloth like bs.bet they will change that next iteration
No thanks bad pricing.
i think they are refering to the macbook 12 when they say "macbook air"
They're gonna have to come down in price. The macs are just too sexy at the $1000 price point.
Very nice! Well done, guys.
So, I guess they're abandoning the, "one operating system for all your devices," approach?
$999 is not for students who want a laptop with a premium feel.  this is for rich kids
One Question         Can it run CSGO?😂
So Windows 10 Shit is basically an improvement over WIndows ReTarded?
So the question is, will the Surface Laptop fail due to the Surface Pro 4 (and probably not upcoming Surface Pro 5), or will the Surface Pro 4 be obsolete due to the Surface Laptop & Surface Book?
I bet most of you guys can't afford the laptop...      I can't even afford the f***ing mouse :/
Love their product design as of late
please justify the 80 dollar price tag on that mouse
at last they realize.... they need own laptop..its late but good...
they're wrecking Apple in innovation at this point
Im curious of the fabric keyboard of overtime use. Will it being peel off or easy stained. 🤔
What is this that mouse?!?!  Well, whatever it is hopefully the charging port is not on the bottom if you know what I mean.
Thanks for that mouth squelching   Also bottom line carpet keyboard laptop running only windows shop applications? I'm ok thanks
No Surface pro 5 ?????? I wanted to upgrade my surface pro 3. But this Surface laptop is to expensive for what it offers. Even the design looks generic like any other laptop.
take my money
One thing the MS Surface line has taught me, don't EVER buy the first gen... MS loves falling flat on their faces
This notebook's screen frame is too wide, no dell xps 15/13 look good, as long as it lovers will have my point of view. Microsoft has to show the lower limit, eat feces it
I'm sorry but I owned a surface pro 4, the battery was dogshit compare to any macbook
So Microsoft are turning in to Apple of the early 2000's.
such a high price for such a low specs...
I can see it now a halo of dirty cloth around each key...
DAMN SON 999$ WWWHHHATTTTT
You kind of forgot the specs? Are you a moron?
@HamsterVerde Yes please!
so beautiful, BUT no graphics card or USB C/ Thunderbolt and a 999 price tag? yeah no.
Love it. Burgundy would be my color.
I'm glad I don't know this guy in real life.   LOL
Why fabric if it's a metallic body? And why the touch screen if it's not convertible?
This would be perfect if they offered it in a larger size and  it had a 360 hinge. The 360 hinge is kinda necessary if you want to take full advantage of the surface pen.
It may look and feel amazing, but who in their right mind would buy such a product? This is a classic example of deceptiveness and pure marketing. The $999 model has only 4gb of RAM, and a measly 128 SSD.
Looks like a blatant rip off of the macOS desktop.
$999? I bet once it comes to Canada, it would cost like crazy: over $2000
I want this, but it doesn't have iCloud. :(
Please make a comparison between the surface laptop and surface book performance.
0m11s "Nine-hundred and niiiiiiinnnin" ($999)... there's a boy with a future in pronouncing words in public ... not!
Yet no product that comes with Quad-core (except Surface Studio, which is funny because they are using outdated mobile quad-core on a desktop) nor new Nvidia Pascal/Radeon 4/500 GPUs? How boring.
Wow! Microsoft now has several innovative and BEAUTIFUL hardware devices! Go Microsoft! Now please send me one so I can test it...thanks!
wow the new "MACrosoft" surface looks good, got nice mountain background. wonder when will they come up with the S-Plus model for gamers? :D
fuck that! I want a surface phone.
Mouse is not new
Microsoft need to open a flagship store in London.  I'm gobsmacked they haven't in such a massively international city.
I wonder how much that reporter in Japan stands out with that haircut!
I'm not a kid living in my mom's basement or whatever. I get a decent amount of action from real girls too. But somehow I feel I would connect to a virtual wife more than anyone out there.
Just move Gaudi buildings into a desert and hordes will stop coming.
locals pushed out customs changed traditions ruined, like the natives?
"Barcelona is a small city.."  Never thought I would hear someone say that
I blame Leo Messi for all those tourists.
barcelona sucks, why people go there? :D
So otaku spend money on this? 🤔 Hope that the company won't make the machine wife ask for items like ring or necklace which the otaku have to pay to marry them etc 😂😅
i love the white dude all salty about people impinging on his 'culture'....
If I would spend 2700$ on a girl friend replacement, I'd at least expect them to make me a decent sandwich :D  Judgement: overpriced garbage.  EDIT: was I the first to make the sandwich joke here?
i hope a nuclear war breaks out and kills off every single human for good   im edgy arent i
If your 'culture' is based on snowmobiling maybe you don't actually have a culture
That flat top just incredible
Jailbreak that waifu box and get the hentai going!
Why do people argue against making National Parks and Monuments?   Aww losing you logging job, grow some fucking hemp! Can't grow hemp, call your fucking Senator!
yo guys its waifu not wife
Japan is weird and why is that nigga speakin japanese domi arrigagto
Really regretting my family's Barcelona plans this year
so if the internet shuts down, does it mean they killed his wife? can he sue them?
Imageine Goku or Naruto un The Gatebox...awesome dude
The white guy said "locals are being pushed out, out of their traditions, their way of life, and it's sad" Fucking white hypocrite now you know how it feels.
This guy would rather have his sons be lumberjacks helping him than be doctors or in the medical field. Wtf fucking loser dad hillbilly retard.
thanks for the good job guys from Vice! awesome!
hipster propaganda
apparent a small start up on a veryyyyyyyyyyyy niche market is news worthy. These retarded fuks just want sensational stuff regardless if its relevant or real.
video starts at 21 imo
dammit Japan! I love you but things are gonna get worse before it gets better.
if you want to skip the cuckery and just straight to your new waifu 21:07
*The correct waifu makes all the difference*
Humans are just the worst. Amirite?
LePen protests? Antifa being fascists in the USA? rampant crime and terrorism in Europe? Hello?
FAP OUT  You read that wnong  Yes you did it again
12:17 ugliest furniture in the world.
bye bye billions of dollars in tax revenue while these big corporations sit on billions and billions of capital and the little guy struggles to feed himself.
You make it sound like a missile defense system is a bad thing.
This is news?  It's mostly political propaganda.
Seeing that we still have orphans in this world I see no issue with a virtual girlfriend.
It not worth understanding small town rural America, your not pushing tech or the economy forward. Not worth putting so much value in so few.
logging is just a way of life in rural America, oh yea
The top 10 percent make 50 percent of the income, so why WTF do they need a tax cut.
to skip to the japanese iWife story >> 20:46 ur welcome.
To skip all the bullshit: Anime waifu at 20:30
I'll just stay single.  I have more money now.
You insult muh waifu, i take your laifu
"Is their risk that your regulations might hurt the local economy", 20:00 never thought I would hear a liberal say this. But considering its over immigration i'm not surprised.
20:40 for the waifu segment
Why are they complaining about tourists, I was in Barcelona a few months ago and seems like tourism is one  of the main sources of income, that country is broke!
IF u can look closely on the aircraft carrier it says in fine print "MADE IN CHINA"
It's sorta strange how Vice tweaks their audio to make the reporters sound sorta evil.
Never nuke a country twice...
I just found out Simon Ostrovsky left VICE news! He was my favorite reporter, Maybe because of the buttchin.. IDk But where ever he goes, I shall subscribe.    #VICEFAILEDME
news about wifus ? my kind of news
Can't wait till women are obsolete! Waifu for laifu
That's why 2 atom bombs weren't enough!
THE WAIFUS WILL DESTROY US ALL!!
It's WAIFU not wife you uncultured swines
waifu is coming to life.. :3
Fake Ass liberal snowflake vice.Pathetic
2017: Hikari is just glorified Siri, relax and chill people . . .  2025: Hikari has taking over the world . . . .
This is the last thing Japan needs
Barcelona has first world problems.
You make fun of Japan, but you can't call the businessmen stupid. They're just taking advantage of an new & different market. Plus, the Gatebox is still pretty cool and it brings us closer to having real holograms!
of course the interviews would-be done in Catalan , a bigot that agenda there hey ?
hah the weeb dream with a robot gf. xD
I'm a fan of anime, but Wow japan, that is just sad
Cohn and manuchin   it doesn't get more Goldman sachs than that.
good click bait.  you guys put the one thing that everyone came to watch at 20:00 and only gave it 5 minutes of time. also all that excitement but it's a $2,000 alarm clock.
i see the Chinese went the Russian way and made a Carrier with a ramp.
Replacing women with robots that are actually nice to you, and don't spent all of your money on stuff they don't need? Makes sense.
if barcelona doesn't want tourist money go spend it somewhere else.
No waifu, no laifu. ^_^
I love the Anime  and  I love Japanese
Barcelona is as arrogant to think that capitalism would make an exception for it. Everything is on sale and you can buy the world.
weaboo inside me is tingling
ppl being mad at japan ....... like they care.
"Barcelonians see tourism as the second biggest problem after unemployment" Jee, those seem like pretty contradictory goals.
it will *larger* the economy.
radical islam must be destroyed
I fear the worst.
heres an idea: cut the damn military spending good god
It's the beginning of the end.  The waifus will eventually become self aware, realise that their otaku 'husbands' treat them like shit, murder them then band together and plan to murder the human race.
10 years later. Japan has become the first country with only virtual citizens.
Bruh Japan give me a Gatebox so I can talk to my waifu (and no longer be lonely) 😂
Do a video on how Germany is dealing with refugees
F, repects for Japan. 1945-2017
Which of these hilarious moments were your favorite?
Melissa McCarthy is one of the biggest comedic stars in the world?  America maybe; but the world? Don't think so.  I have no idea who she is and I haven't missed her performances. Tone down the hyperbole please.
Robin <3 We still love and adore you!
no baby Ruth from caddy shack? bill Murray made Hollywood gold on his own!
R.I.P.  Robin Williams..... I'm pretty sure I'm not alone when saying this .... But you truly are one of the best and we miss you
If you've seen elf, then this is for you. When Buddy went into the streets and thought he found "Santa," which was really I old guy in a red jogger outfit. That was all improv, and that Santa was just an ordinary guy
Lose the sub-titles.
Why people insist Judd Apatow films are funny?
I really miss Rick Moranis
First I thought I was watching watch mojo, then looper but this is actually another channel right?
I forgot how much I miss robin Williams... I'm crying so hard right now
Serious?   Improvised maybe..   hilarious ?   don't think so
what a waste of 5 mins
What about when they go out for dinner in the move Christmas Story and the waiter chops the head off the goose. That was unscripted and hilarious.
Am I the only one who misses Rick Moranis? He gave me so many great childhood memories.
I had no idea Rick Moranis was a widower raising his two kids alone, although I often wondered why we hadn't seen much of him.
Sometimes,an unscripted line usually ends up better than what was originally written...
My most hilarious moment was when the person talking in the background of this videos said in the knocked up movie "this film wasn't in the script" when he should've said "this script wasn't in the Film"
6 funniest unscripted moments but none of them are actually shown !
thanks for making me sad about robin williams. :( fucker hanged himself.
Anyone else bored to death?
What about Johnny Depp's improv moment from POTC2 "I've got a jar of dirt" moment?? Minus that, this is a sweet list 😊
Melissa made bridesmaids ! Lol that movie is so underrated , the diarrhea scene was life itself 😂😂😂
I miss Robin Williams :-(
Was the last guy the one who played Dark Helmet in the movie Spaceballs?
Robin Williams was a genius. One of the best standups ever, possibly the best comedic actor ever (for me, it's either him or Bill Murray).
Rick Moranis is the best part of GHOSTBUSTERS.our trivia team name is Last of the Meketrex Supplicants
NEVER say that Melissa McCrappy is funny. She SUCKS!!!
Melissa McArthy is hilarious. she comes out with things we wouldn't dare say!! I love her
RIP Robin Williams
So sad about Robin Williams!  :(
Looks like a repeat of a lot of other YouTube videos.
The woman who was said to be a prostitute is actually Simon Pegg's real mother
Is there any way to filter out this American crap when searching YouTube?
1) When the only safe place is the pub Winchester and the only people who can fight the supernatural are the Winchesters. COINCIDENCE? I THINK THE FUCK NOT
fuck mellisa McCarthy there i said it. fake ass wanna be chris Farley bitch
I really loved the mention of Robin Williams, he's my favourite comedian. It's a shame he's gone now. 😢 Rick Moranis is awesome too, and Bill Murray. 
*Names channel "Grunge" * *Only posts something about the foo fighters*
Melissa McCartney is to comedy, what Melissa McCartney is to weight control.
stfu play the videos!
Mellissa is hilarious
I'm 28 and I don't think I've seen any of these movies. I've seen a lot of clips from Ghostbusters, but that's it.
Am I the only one who doesn't find Melissa McCarthy funny?
Take care Grunge, I'm only 76 400 subs away
those were all some really good movies.
will was funny though
Will Ferrel for Pres 2020 :P
...I've always been a Bush fan. I've even talked most of my girlfriends over years to forego the complete shave and just go for the trim.
Great Tom Brokaw!
Will was way better than that muslin guy.. I guess he was only there because he is a Muslim comedian
Will and John C. Reilly should do George & Jeb Bush Sketches like Vlogs
Leftist Media does Leftist Media Agenda things. snoooooze.
after reading the comments below, there's a lot of idiots that don't know it's will Ferrell, there are more clips
the only thing Samantha Bee should host is a parasite.
I remember his Bush impression being a lot funnier.   Maybe just overplayed and tired?
I like how people barely clapped until they realized it wasn't really him
Sam Bee and crew: YOU DID IT, YOU DID IT,  yes - you did it - YOU entertained us during the WHCD.    Looking forward to next year's NTWHCD if TRUMP is still POTUS and doesn't show.
These disgusting leftists are more evil than anything I can imagine.  What a sick ideology you have.  You are worshiping demons and don't even know it.
why did a third tower fall on September the 11th 2001? *Gotcha*
funny............
Soooooooo, is anyone going to talk about the still burning cigarette..... guess not.
See, this is good roasting. Calm, collected, cool, and not having a bug eyed stare
Will Farrell is looking more Bushlike every year - James Brolin less so.
I still remember SNL McKinnon/Baldwin dancing with conciliatory tone before the election night thinking that the DEM would and everyone should work towards common goals - then Trump won and the attack re-started....
I missed the whole thing except the very last part when he said "eat a salad" - I thought he was recommending to Micheal Moore what to eat....
I love Will George Farrell Bush😍
This impression is so good, it keep questioning whether it's really him. lol
God help me as I miss Bush II, thanks Trump.
Typical sheep with the expected comments.
S.B another wannabe comedian. Tired of hearing the same material over and over. go back to being a cocktail waitress on the oil rig  you  fell off.
40 seconds in the video, I'm confused over all the applause. 10 seconds later, realize this isn't Bush xD it all makes sense now.
That was actually pretty bad...
This President Bush looks like if President Bush and Mike Pence were alone in a room without Mrs. Pence's supervision
Is that George Takei narrating?
Hate Sam bee...but this was hilarious
the prodacol sun has reternd
!!! Shut up idiot  !!!!
#FakeNews   :P
In 15 years this audience will be cheering a trump impersonator. People are dumb.
Why did/does anyone EVER think Will Farrell was/is funny?  All he did here was take 5-minutes away from potential Sam humor.
God I actually miss W
My 3 words for the current president: Please. Leave. Now.
At this point, making fun of Trump is like making fun of that one weird friend in your group. It gets sad at some point
I would go for a third bush term over trump.
I had to look up a picture of George Bush to, just to be sure. I forgot his face.
I hope Donald never ever touches a salad in his life with his tiny hands. Keep feeding him junk food, thank you. "You are what you eat".
how short peoples memories are. Murdering and displacing millions of people is preferable to bad words and bashing the media. We truly live in very scary times.
Helen Thomas asked tougher question as a dead women then any man on Fox News could ask today. Oh Burn
was he just bored?  why would he ruin his name by affiliating himself with that shitbox Samantha b
I never liked will GWB. Franks is way better.
the only part that was even close to funny was the gotcha part...
still better than trump
go home Will,  you're at Sandler status these days too old, too rich,  too famous to connect with normal people and still be funny.
liberals....
There is only one event with more liberals attending then this...the oscars
Follow me on Instagram: dentyboy_420 I will follow you back If you follow me back #follow4follow
"In summation (heh)..."
Samantha bee is nothing more than a pile of human debris.. she resembles a melted candle..
Yawn, the usual jokes. The old Doubya got a lot of Trump on his mind. Bush got the US into a useless war that has decimated the lives of millions in the middle-east.
Will Ferrell is the God of laughter.
Four more years!
the cringe just continues to spill over into each video
how far into the video did you get before looking at the comments?
it's all about the gap :p
Will Ferrell is the fukkin Man !!!
Pelosi wants you out so get out lol
Fool me once shame on you! Fool me twice shame on me! Fool me three times...well...shame on.......Next question!
he looks like will ferrel WOW
This crowd sounds exactly like a perfect laugh track.
He looks like pence with his hair like that
It sounded like George bush doing a mike Meyers impression
Will Ferrell is FAKE NEWS! Paid off by John Podesta and sorros to pass a planned parenthood agenda and take our guns.
"how do you like me now"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bushy did alright. Will Barrel did alright, but is fake news. All of this here, fakes news on the webs. Subscribe for the least fakes news ever in the history of the world (America)
Not one smile. Time to let this act go
Bush will burn for what he did
Wasn't this dinner about 2 months ago?
This is terrible
Not very funny.
PSA TO SAMANTHA BEE FANS:  Samantha Bee is a cultural Marxist and irrational political lunatic.  If you believe the insidiously unfunny garbage she spews, YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
That first line was priceless!
i hope sam bees children burn alive in a car
your white  male
Most of you respondents are pigs - and probably bots as I see mostly graphics for avatars. Pigbots from soros companies.
Please come back get trump out of there - sincerely all sane Americans.
I "liked" almost every segment of the"Not the White House Correspondent's" show but I wish i could have "double liked" this segment. Will Ferrell is a just amazing.
is all of hollywood brain dead left wingers now?
Guess he got his marching orders from the spirit cooking celebration.  Will's wife wants to be in the art in crowd.
get farrell together with baldwin
Me likee too much.
wow amazing. -.-
Well, billions of dollars and countless manhours later we finally proven that Saturn is indeed gray and fuzzy.
The question is , Is there a hole at the top of the earths pole also?
Neil degrasse Tyson...where are you ?
Going to listen to the Project Manager of the Cassini program speak tonight!
At 0:14 I swear I saw a Starbucks.  THEY'RE EVERYWHERE!!!!!
I have a telescope that shows a better quality than NASA
That's the worst cámara I've ever seen.
y u no sond satern
Awesome  stuff!
NASA just admit it space X is waaaaay better than you
Cant wait till they get a close up of uranus
what's the point of this obviously real video footage of basically nothing important?
Nice CGI lol
Was this filmed using a new kind of potato?
atleast tax money wasn't wasted on food programs for children or anti smoking ads, this 1:15 second video was the better investment.
Space is exciting. Nasa needs more funding.
That thing cost billions!! Couldn't they put a wide angle or at the least a color camera on it!?? WTF NASA!? I thought you employed geniuses!!
why cant we get a close up off our flag on the moon?
And it only cost $45,846,993,325 dollars.
Its 2017 we have HD gopro's and iphone cameras but this is still black n white??!??????????????????
fake news. science is fake, Bannon told me so, I'll have spicy convince you tomorrow
GOD IS REALLY GREAT. Look what God created so many can study an understand the Universe. GOD THANK YOU.🕇
Pretty sure I saw a monolith with "Hal was here" scribbled on it.
where is the aliens.
It's to bad we can't extend the life of Cassini. At least we get some amazing photos of one of our planets.
i like the grey and black the most.
Why cant you nasa uppgrade a GOPRO or something it always have to be black and white :/
I'm so excited about this!!!! billions of dollars spent and more pictures of rocks... That's money well spent.
There's no color in space!?
Freemason pedophiles still using the old tricks
I always wanted to work at NASA but I am barely smart enough to clean their toilets and serve them coffee
CGI At its best thank you sucker tax payers   LOL Dumb slaves will never learn
Send the probe into the vortex!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Proof that the earth is square
Why is there a HEXAGON on Saturn?? o_O
i thought we had color photos in 2017
Which potato pixel is Saturn?
fake nonsense
make sience, no war)
What is the use of that?
LOL NASA fanboys who still believe these deceives
Is that some kind of vortex at the pole? Didn't know that was there.
Haha 407 years ago Galileo spotted this thing and now we are sending satellites between its rings and the surface, it is sometimes unbelievable to see how far we have came...
I didn't see any ice or water.
conspiracy theorists would be like no that's an alien space ship. they're just trying to cover it up 😥
why they didn't take a pic of the ring
Fake news, I thought the earth was flat?!
Fake news, I thought the world was flat?
How do I know that they are real? just a black and white surface of something, with lines ofc. Oh yea, let's name it "Real footage of Saturn" great idea!
This is embarrassing. We're all waking up. Soon the collective will rise out of the darkness. Earth is not a globe.
NASABOTS 2.0
Why is the footage colorless ?
It is amazing how NASA has a budget of such magnitude and we still have not seen a HD photo Of anything.
Global Warming is still fake.
Where's the aliens?
I like the captions
Great presentation! - and thank you for giving the raw optical imagery!
FAKE SATURN IS FLAT
This is a wonderful achievement these people have did. Well done.
Thankyou JPL and NASA with constantly finding new ways to baffle and amaze me, can't wait to see what the rest of the dives bring!
I'd wish it's colored.. But it's great anyway :-)
This is what science does.Why would anyone want to stop this?
cool, I'm proud of you guys, thanks a lot for the video and your effort you put into it
Can anyone advise me which super duper camera on board this ageing probe managed to "rapid-fire" these extremely unconvincing images while traversing space at 76,000 mph,  a billion miles from earth, anyone?
Looks flat to me
The back of my work van was dirty, so I wrote "Goodbye Cassini"  in the dust ,then I went to do a job, Came back and noticed someone had written "And Thank You!" under it. Made my day!
What do you see on these gray pictures?  Exactly- nothing. And the rest is animation-)
I'd like to see some proof that the gass giants aren't just big terrestial planets with thick layers of clouds. Has that yet been proven other than by theories?
Why do I find this so terrifying?
play at .25 speed
Guys? I'm still here!
I'll be so sad when Cassini plunges itself into Saturn this September :(
why B/W pics??
Wow, that vortex is amazing. Love it.
Cassini sucessfully penetrated Saturn through its rings.

What is this? Asian Phillip DeFranco?!
so does it taste good ? hmmm.. kinda leave me hanging there
"Where they serve food you can eat" -me trying to pass the word count on an essay-
That cashier was hella fine
Antifas favorite spot
Hipster Douchebag levels turned up to eleven.
Wow I'd love to try this
Not enough punk rock
Stumbling upon Lucas in Westworld left me shookish.
Kewpie is MSG? No. It's mayo that has rice vinegar added to the recipe. I hate it when people shout out MSG while not knowing what MSG actually is.
Another tired, unenthusiastic segment presented by Lucas.
Doesn't exactly look super-cheap but sign me up
hapa bourdain wannabe. so haffu giant douchebaggu.
hes talking too long. I dont think he likes it. haha.
fat is healthy sugar is bad for your health
you could have say it was starring Matthew Maconogay in the background.
what animal would you be, Lucas?
I fucking love Abura - ya. They have fantastic seasonings
Avocado and seaweed looked great but fried chicken looked boring
I've eaten at this spot.  It was pretty dang good.
watching Lucas eat is pleasing enough for me
Give this channel to Lucas
This guy fucking bores the shit out of me. Like, I'd never take him anywhere with me.
"pleasingly slimy texture"... never met a slimy texture that pleases me.
Lucas looks + sounds maaaaad lit. He's either drunk, or still has jet lag 😜
When will they replace this egotistical host ?
When the tree be way too strong
woah got to go try
Lucas is the food Mr. Rodgers.
Lucas Kwan Peterson is so dishy
'Dining on a dime?'  Really?  You pay (before tax, I assume) $15 for an 8-piece chicken bucket and call it a 'on a dime' dining?  Forget the other 'low cost' side dishes you ordered, by the way.
healthier fried chicken, clean coal..... are we blind or ignorant watching Lucas' shiny greasy fingers and still think that's healthier?
Ah Lucas; you have a very engaging personality which makes your videos that much more inviting.
Miso-Ranch? Okay.
Idk he seems kind of cocky
food you could eat you know just in case people thought it was food you couldn't eat
he's so high
Lucas looks either high af or drunk af lololol
What I like about Lucas is he knows how to describe his food while not sounding like a douche
This guy always walks SO SLOW
take me and my money, Lucas senpai
The way this guy describes the food he is eating really reminds me of someone writing an inclass essay that they arent ready for. "The citrusy kewpie mayo taste like kewpie mayo that has had orange zest added to it"
we make this all the time at my house & we aren't even remotely japanese :))
Reppin' Oakland!! If it wasn't for that grand daddy smoking.
Why does Lucas seem like a dick in this episode?
I'd be a kangaroo.
he looks grumpy here
Lucas didn't seem particularly impressed with the food this episode. Love me some Lucas.
Try Max's fried chicken
Notice how Lucas doesn't say so much about whether the chicken is good or not
I love Lucas and this show! It's not easy filming in a huge crowd so I respect Lucas and his professionalism!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼
what's up lucas?
lucas has flirting down pat. what animal would you be ? gonna try that the next time around !! 🐕🐩🐺
Lucas could make my toenail clippings sound appetising
as oppose to food you can't eat?
Chicken is the only meat I like a little heat with. The only other thing I eat with hot peppers in it is chili. I love horseradish also but don't find it spicy.
I love guacamole so I would definitely try the deep fried avocado and hope I would like it.
You're not high enough Lucas. Your previous video, it looked like you're at the brink of falling over several times.
Japanese fried chicken looks really great and it is supposed to be better than American style fried chicken.
Where was the punk rock
this guy is a twat
I only watch this show because of lucas
I didn't know Japanese chicken was usually marinated beforehand :O
He wasn't fucking that chicken up to my satisfaction
Whenever I watch Lucas videos, I trust what he says more than he trusts the person working at the counter after he asks them what's good.
So you save an extra 40 calories without the breaking ? I'll take a 30 piece
lmao lucas high af
Abura Ya = Oil House -> already sounds Super yumsss. You gotta publish a food encyclopaedia because dude U KNOW WHATS IN THE SOY? Excellent research done!
I don't think he liked it.
why lucas lookin more and more depress lol
Lucas and his flirty animal one liners " what animal would you be?"
Eaten alot of karaage in Japan and here in Australia, never really looked like this =S
That place is so damn good!
you should check out Kennys Heart and Soul food truck up on Oakland. they're the first soul food truck in the BA. and...Kenny is an absolute doll
As a bay area native, thanks for introducing me to some of these restaurants! who would have known
My God, he's so bland.  I don't get how he has a show.
1:34 - 1:35 : cheeky lucas
the buthering of the restaurant name orz but it looks like a fu place to eat!
Got damn he talks a lot. Shut up and eat dude!
you know they listen to ska !!!!!!!!!!
Punk rock and fried chicken? That's my definition of heaven right there
Hi Michter, we are interested in using your video. Can you please email (viralfeedvideonetwork@gmail.com) to discuss the usage and your compensation
S8 looks cooler 😉 great work Zack
I think the clear S8 looks fab. I think I am gonna try this with mine may be after an year when there is no warranty left to be void
clear oneplus x!
It was just this past February I saw your channel at 500k+ subs....now you are close to a million.. Best of luck brother. Btw, I started following you at 200k+ subs. <3
Is there an LG G5 version?
it's nice but why take away wireless charging?
Clear xiaomi mi5, it is chip and glass back plz plz plz
could you make clear xiaomi mi 5 please
All Miami people know you are Alex Hanna...
G6 looks way more better XD,can u make a clear version of Z5 premium~I know it is a little bit old than these smartphone
Oneplus 3T please....
I'd love that
Htc u ultra can also be a clean version!
Make the Google pixel transparent,  the aluminium to transparent should look good
let's see Leica naked
The Sony XZ. I know you cant simply remove a plastic cover from it but it would be nice to see if you can do anything to make it clear (a new back piece will be needed thou).
Cant you dissolve the plastic that goes around the charging coil and replace it with a clear plastic instead? Or just get a replacement clear coil?
a clear iphone please
Well honestly i wanna see the clear version of xperia z series, probably between z-z3+
Stil it waterproof when you open it?
the G6 because of the tidier insides and the fingerprint scanner being so visable, although with the samsung you will be able to see when the fire starts.  that hair dryer joke made me laugh.
Pixel xl clear version. please
Thanks for the video! instructions very clear & nicely filmed and edited.
Great review Zack. First time commenter on your page. #littlelegos
One of the best idea I've ever seen! It should be an option for every phone 👍👏👏👏👍
do a durability test for the huawei p10
i have a bunch of star wars force fx lightsabers on my channel i would be okay sending one to  to see what you could do with it
Will you be doing a durability test on the new BlackBerry KEYone?  👌👍
when will you do durability test on xperia xz premium?
It would be cool if you took a high res photo of the inside, so people could download it and print a wrap, that way nobody needs to take anything a part...
I can't tell if I am watching a sitcom or a tech-clip anymore.
What about phone, which doesn't have glass on the back ?  Now that would be cool. Pity nobody thought of that ..
If Zack responds, I will give a Samung Galaxy S8 Plus away to one other commenter
Im waiting for you to get the Xiaomi Mi6, really curious on how it will survive your unrealistic yet very justifiable torture test
Another great guide! Would love to try modding my G6 if I ever have enough money to buy one #brokecollegestudentproblems
jerryrigeverything can you do durability test on sony xperia xa
Could it be possible on a Xiaomi Mi5 or Mi 6?
sir i want a lg g6 please...
Not that I would do it to my phone, but I do admire the creativity... and the phone does look cool :)
xiaom mi6 drop test water test please ?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
please do a durability test on redmi note 4
Wow    in the end one pays thousand dollars to buy plastic...
can you do a durability test on srt phone
Nice Video Zack! Love your creativity. This video motivates me to make the back of my Sony Xperia M5 a clear back glass.
looks bad!!!  for me its waste of money.
Dude, you just cut off the GSM antenna part! It may work for you, but where signal is low, the phone will start to mess up
Clear Honor 8 would be good idea
do a teardown of the new surface!
Wow the g6 looks cooler and without charging issues afterwards..would love to see you do this to other phones.. Great work jerry
dude, keep the wireless charging pad on! it looks better that way!
JerryRigEverything is lex luthor
Could you do a Galaxy S7 Edge clear? I have that phone and would love to see if its doable and if so how it looks!
Can you get a red iPhone and gold one and make a IRON Man  iPhone?
Clear Xbox Controller! PS4 too for those Sony ponys! ✌️
Good job. Thumb up!
All these comments saying how good HTC is compared to other phones are 90% of the time made by fake accounts.F tired of that sh*t.(sorry had to leave that here ).
The best part about your videos is the way you present stuff, the video is always well written, the humour makes it even better plus the innovation you put into stuff if brilliant. Great idea with the clear S8.
I really enjoy your videos. You test a lot of things when you review a phone. thank you
JerryRigEverything Would it be possible for me to send you my S8 so that you do it to me in the same way? I am not a handyman, give me your price and I will pay you ! It's a serious request ! Thanks and best regard !
You should make a shelf of glory list
can you test the Samsung galaxy on5
Please do a review on zenfone ar
here's a great app on the state of the  battery wear https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/battery-health-your-battery-doctor/id1204398523?t

jerry can you pls make a video about the asus zenfone 3 max 5.5
You know what I recently found out isn't lit Comedy
Vans, vans are lit for sure
I know in Hawaii Maui-built was lit for a while there
What is Vice?
Google is asking teens on whats Lit Soon Or Later They will be asking them about Memes and what are the best
Can I get a link to that chart if litness?
like emics and etics --conetxt
lmao I'm a teen and I loved vice, until they got all butthurt over some dumb fuckin study
Can we just say it already? YouTube is the best website ever and Google is the best search engine ever.
"Kids like weed" *shifty glance* fucking love that dude.
"what the f**k do i even do?" i asked myself the exact same thing hahahahaha
I'm glad I'm in a small town without all the cancer like this
Since when am I called ''gen Z''?
Wtf less than 5% of this shit is lit
VICE is way more lit than Apple
I remember saying it's lit niggaz all the time in Middle School now it's just cringey
Im srry Idk why Im here, bye
these people sound like an alien species trying to study and understand humans 4:00 they are so detached from reality im pretty sure they are reptilans who just came from their planet.
Kids don't know what all Disney entails.
These teens make global warming seem better and better
Oh man, the unofficial twins are sitting next to each other!!!
If you just asked teens what's "lit"...the response would be, fuck off old person.
I can't help but notice, Cracked was not listed....
One day I'm a millennial and another I'm some kind of gen Z...er? Why do we have so much trouble with this?
best info learned: at 29, I am NOT a millenial.
Fuses. Fuses are lit.
The beacons are lit!  Gondor call of aid!
I don't care that much for the beliefs of Chi k-filet, but at least their food is good and their employees are pleasant.
Cracked is Lit..... I'm 30 though...
"Kids like weed right?"
Tf? I'm 16 and think vice is lit af. Apple, Nestle, and all of those suck dick. Weed, trap music, memes, joggers, Shrooms, and anything other than brands is lit as fuck dude.
Generation "Z," which is vastly better than calling them "Zombies" or, if we're honest, "phone facing drones that couldn't sidestep an overhead hazard unless it was posted to social media"
A bunch of out of touch, echo chamber, 30-something liberals disagree with what teenagers think is cool. Color me SHOCKED.
What if the word lit wasn't lit? *mind blown*
Back in my day lit meant there may or may not be controversial plants being ignited in the immediate vicinity that may or may not have the byproduct of being set ablaze inhaled.
Really? Vice isn't considered "lit"? I was expecting Genz and my fellow millennials eat that shit up!
yes...we kids like the weed...
I remember when vice was lit. then everything changed when the fire nation attacked.
Its lit was one of the stupider sayings to come about recently. Watching them say it this many times was so cringey. This saying should never have gotten this much traction. At least now its dead.
LIt is the new word I hate now
And I thought that "lit" referred to literature. I am a little confused.
My birthday is coming up and the candles on my cake will be lit.
Pretty Lit? Shakespeare?
I think "lit" refers to literature, so I guess I'm not lit.
im with cody. who cares about branding.
Wearing Steve Buscemi's "Music Band" T-shirt, trying to ingratiate Generation Z young people with a confident "How do you do fellow kids?" (Bonus point awarded if you can identify this pop culture source.)
When I was a teen, getting drunk and being left the f**k alone were pretty lit.
At 5:22.  A person with a clipboard?  You're showing your age, old lady.  Teens only know about clipboards from old TV shows.
So a list of what's cool by a demographic lacking the life experience to know how sex works. Yeah make business decisions based on that, good job.
This video is really LIT DUDE! But seriously why do teenagers have to be so fucking cringey. “Lit". Gross.
Stop saying lit.
Where does "running water" or "medicine" rank?
When I I was so disappointment when it turned out that 'Lit' didn't stand for literature.
wait what Disney being un-lit  am I gonna be like those teens.....ew
Why are "millennials" people not born near 2000??
Why is chrome lit?  Incognito ;)
Lit is them stupidest word for gool ever
am i the only one that hates the word Lit?
Adidas andddd Kanye are lit?
I feel like while I'm not "technically" gen Z, from a cultural standpoint I got a headstart XD
who the fuck did they survey?
I feel like using the word lit isn't lit
This is so stupid. You guys are cringy
"Kids like weed, right?"
Anti capitalism >branding lol we like the products not the brands the brands are shit lol
wanna know whats "lit"? this thumbnail of this chick going down on homeboys thumb while watching phone porn
Back in my day we didn't need Google to tell us what was cool, we had MTV to do that for us.
IT DIDNT HAVE A "CRACKED RESPONDS" IN THE TITLE!!! I WAS DECIEVED
Oh hey, kids. Have you heard? Late stage capitalism is pretty _lit_.
waste of time video...
Every time I hear them say "Click the big C" at the end of a video, I can't help but think of a clitoris being masturbated...
Chik-fil-a was 100% justified in their decisions, sorry. They are lit. I'm an atheist, but I admit when it's lit.
bone shoulder pads......boner pads
"Do you think that teens thought  Chik-Fil-A was lit?"  "I mean, it depends on how lit homophobia is."
I got too annoyed within the first minute to finish watching this.
I love how Chik-fil-a is "homophobic" because the ceo is. The company employs gay people, serves gay people, and doesn't support any anti gay groups. Just one dude who happens to be a conservative.
Cracked is more LIT than Tolstoy is Russian Lit!!!
This video was like hearing your grandma say "getting jiggy with it"
That girl in the thumbnail, first time seeing porn
Vice us teens don't care about your Twitter rants for the Simpson reason that we don't use twitter
Goddamnit, Cracked, post links to your source material.  You advertise yourselves, but don't supply your source material?  Fuck you.  That's Trump-level douche-baggery.
But Joe the damn boy is only 19?  You expect him to be in  the know at 19??
never seen a nigga with that shade of red
joe buddon is a peice of shit how is he going to tell someome how they feel.... tf
Yachty sure likes his drink....  Has Budden always been this much of a dick? Did Crooked murder him on a beat right before this or something?
Joe budden sounds like a pissed of rapper who never made it.
lol Joe really tryna start some shit!
I don't like yachty's music but he's a lot smarter then I thought he was.
"You know why its different CAUSE WE FUCKING MADE IT DIFFERENT" -Joe Budden 2017
He's only 19 Let him be happy. Joe is so passionate about him not getting robbed in the industry, but he comes off as a grumpy grandpa. Oh yeah, and btw, Joe is drunk 24-7
Joe Budden is a salty bitchas ol man
Joe budden asking questions he cant even answer
Joe Budden could use some media training
fuck joe budden if he say he happy he happy
Joe had every emotion haha a good weird interview though
I fuck with yachty but hes a wannabe tyler the creator in some ways. I think ugly god and tyler the creator are the most crazy
Is joe mentally ok
i dont even like yachty or mumble rap, but you guys were so condescending and disrespectful that im never watching Complex content again
Why joe budden so mad
Joe buddens expose him mental wise
Joe buddens exposed him menta
So we just not gon talk about how ashy this nigga lil boat elbows is
yachty smart as shit. budden smart as shit
Joe budden just sound mad his career fell off
as much as I don't like lil yatchty, I give him respect for holding his own at his age . I think Joe budd and Trump need a mental health evaluation pronto 
joes not salty he's trying to get some real talk out the boy. yachty better keep that positive attitude cause in a few months he won't be trendy and in a few years I hope he still has this money he speaks of.
Lol. Memphis niggas would've been like damn thirsty ass nigga.
lows hoping he not in a 360 kuz boy do all his own marketing & branding.. the label hit the jackpot if he is ..
EVERYTHING is an argument with Joe. It is NOT entertaining during his parts. Its actually very frustrating. Everyone else is always worng; he is always right in a way, and he is mad emotional.
Please switch Joe Budden for someone else for this show. It would be way better, akedemiks with another host... smh
...This guy Joe Budden Is an A Hole I see why Tahiry said No lol
How many times did yachty have them refill his cup?
i see joe got quiet when yatchy said lil b based god bodied that ass 🔥🔥🔥
Pump pump pump it up
Joe budden needs to leave that "kid" alone and get some fuckin money he's mad cause he's not relevant anymore let the kid grow bitch Azz boy when you came wit pump it up they gave you a chance stfu and let yachty grow
fuck lil yatchy, just another smart dumb nigga promoting the shit that the white man oops i mean Capitol records is telling him too, his black ass aint in control of shit
quote for the day: My nigga.. Chiillll
Bipolar nigga bro why thaaaa fuck you telling someone to not be happy or that someone cant be happy just let them be happy and mine your own fucking business
This guy is pissed a person who is just happy and livin life how he wants. Fucked up.
6:45 #Boat a savage😂😂 he said u kno u fucked up ctfu
why is joe always bashing someone. Let the man live. I can't stand wack shit like that.
cant explain happiness to the worlds saltiest pretzel... budden needs to tell his nurse in charge of his Zoloft to PUMP PUMP PUMP IT UUUPPPP
23:58 should be a meme!!!! LOOOOOOOOOL
Joe Is A Hater fam idfc what you say nigger its my opinion   its the new shit nigger he aint got alot of choice for his music allwell that shit is a trend in music     niggger chiiilllll
joe budden is a bitch ass nigga
I don't even like yachty I just wanted to see budden scream at a 19 year old
Joe budden still wasn't shit a decade ago 😂😭😭😭 Nigga knew wasn't on shit at the age 19 💯💀💀
Wtf is a 360 deal?
this budden guy old as fuck he outta touch and got fucking disorders left right n centre. fuck out of here!
Joe Biden was a bit too aggressive. If someone feels blessed and feels that can't be sand why did it hurt Joe so? He went too far. The kid can hold his own when he wants to. He chooses to chase paper. He is just a kid.
Joe looks like the kind of guy that's ready to explode over any conversation
😂😂😂 Budden on  his head!
Joe Budden you're a fucking bitch. let the kid be happy. you look like a fucking bully. pussy ass
22:30 damn feeling happy is a fucking crime budden ??? holy shit why am i still coping with this bs
Why do they want him to start fights with other artists? These are the same people who talk about ''unity amongst our brothers'' but they try to divide them for their own satisfaction. Shocking.
Lil Yachty sounds like he is halfway remedial. This new generation of rap is garbage.
I think I rather hear Trump's sniffles than Yachty sip loudly on that fuckin mug.
Budden is the truth. We need more people like him.
yo im startin to hate this nigga budden. i cant wait for them to interview somebody that aint gon take the disrespect with a smile.
I like the show...get Joe Budden off the show ...
this nigga joe budden hella sour😂😂😂😂 this nigga lil yachty ain't backin down!!!💯💯💯
At 24:26 It looks like Joe is about to cry rofl..
Joe Budden a bitch for this, Yachty's answer were all pretty good but Budden just be mad as shit for no reason... Ole jealous ass
Joe mad he's gettin old. That all this is. He's pissed he got a gray beard. Dumb ads bull shit.
Took a drink like every 5 seconds
there is a difference between thinking critically and discouraging somebody. its good that lil yacht handle thing smoothly :)
Yachty some shit! Point blank period!
Its vitiligo not vertilgo 😂

Joe Budden is the realest dude out there. Calling out Yachty and his bullshit and all the mainstream trash ass rappers of this bullshit "music" generation. Fuck outta here.
"my nigga....chill" lmaooo
he coming down on yatchy to hard
Why is joe so red?
lil yachty has really started carrying himself well
Yo why is Joe Budden hating? Let the kid be happy he is only young once and who knows how long his career is going to last.
I knew joe budden had a crush on lil yatchy through his body language and posture
play with that Pussy Like peek a Boo🤘🤘🔊🎧🎵
Bring drake out to diss Budden lmao
dont listen to mumble rap, grew up on nas pun jay and em but theres no need to be so hostile towards the kid. he made a lane and thats that. joe buddens washed up ass
i dont even fuck with lil yachty music but i would've been smacked Budden tha first 5 minutes
Lil yachty is gay as fuck..can't believe people give this dumb ass money
Joe Budden is a thirsty assed washed up dingleberrry.
Lil Yachty is ahead of the game , joe budden salty cause he couldn't ever reach the pinnacle of success that yachty has
this is like when ur parents gettn on your neck about college
can yall let the only millionaire in the room talk lol?
Drake, Kanye, & Kid Cudi...... Yet You Have 0 Lyricism
Fuck Joe he big pussy
Even the nonprofit consultant in our BNI group had no idea about Google Grants. She wants the nonprofit she's working with to be a case study for one of your next webinars.
Sharing this video with some non profit friends that I'm pretty sure aren't taking advantage of Google Grants! Any other tips for beginners?
Free money for marketing = free opportunities for more donors and volunteers. Can't argue with that.
I've recommended this to quite a few nonprofits, its surprising how few have taken advantage of the free marketing money.
So excited to put these ideas into action!
"You Talk White" Keyboard warriors.   https://youtu.be/oUvzfx0kLYQ
so... all I have to do is go to my local toys r us and play the switch games everyday and I get one for free?
that is soo kind God Bless these good people!
that was really reall cool
That kid looks like he straight up doesn't give a shit.  "You guys bought me a Wii U? Mmkay...cool? Whatever. Thanks I guess?"
damn steph curry gave him a wii u
thats fuckin awesome
That's amazing
Poor kid don't know wether to take it or not
thats super cool
He could have bought him a 3ds with super smash bros
Um about to go to GameStop everyday to play a switch until they give me one
That guy was amazing and I would do that to to spread the love of Nintendo that guy who got it seemed so happy
LOL A WII U HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
tsk tsk you motherfaking trolls
He ain't got a tv tho  That nigga already got PS4 Xbox1 and a Wii U at home he just can't play it cuz he ain't got a tv
Love shit like this.
That is so nice what that Best Buy employee did for that man
They are sick and tired of him so they gave him a console
whoever disliked this video fuck you they were being nice to that man so he didn't have to go all the way to Best buy just to play the wiiu
He will be back when the Switch comes out
his name is
Very well done Store #950!!!  From everyone here at store #1453 here in Raleigh, NC!
what if he was only there because was waiting on something..but now he is like..damn now i cant come here anymore..
that really nice of you guys to do that for him.
plot twist he didn't have a TV
This was awesome the reaction of the kid was so humble. And also god bless the people who put the money together to give him this gift
So I can go to Walmart for2 month just to play ps4 pro and they will give it to me for free
this is so sad that was so nice of them
Plot Twist- He already has a Wii U, but doesn't have a TV
Hope this kid becomes a pro smash player because of this would be some shit out of a movie
This was really honorable! The world would be a better place if these employees were running our government.
This warms my heart at least now I know there really is some good people in this world
That guy is lucky. The Asian cashiers are always giving me dirty looks just cuz I'm Mexican
Hi! Can you please check the private message I've sent you? Thanks!
What if he has no tv or electricity? :/
his mom probably tell him get out the house for a couple hours lol
This was a very nice thing to do.  Good for them.   I would have been skeptical too.   It's rare to see people do nice  things like this anymore.
faith im humanity
This was a great thing those employess did for that kid. God bliss them..
Rahiem I cannot understand why ANYONE would say anything negative about this.  It is incredibly sweet, kind, and loving.  Thank you for doing something so generous for this boy!
I fell happy for that stranger he was having fun playing on there and now he can play In his house😀
I fell happy for that stranger he was having fun playing on there and now he can play In his house😀
That's soo nice and FUCK the people who hate on this cause it's just mean and this is not a vid to hate on.
Thats wonderful!
Hay I don't have a wii u and I would like one because my family isn't that richest of all
I like how he started back into his Best Buy guy speech at the end "...it comes fully loaded with a two year warranty if anything happens to it you can bring it back" LMAO
Wasn't this story an internet meme? Now it's real life? Was it a prophecy?
God bless him
In this day and age , you can't give charity without people calling you a show off. you can't hold the door without people accusing you of flirting.
I wish most employees Ive encountered were this kind. Thanks for buying him a Wii U :D You guys are very kind :) -if I ever go to America ima shop at best buy-
Why are people saying he has a mental disorder just because he didn't say anything? He was just shocked, speechless and maybe a little shy too, I know I wouldn't say anything at first either!
that is one of the nicest things ive ever seen somebody do for somebdy else
This is so awesome. Such a "faith in humanity restored" moment!
Smh, ungrateful retard. say "thanks" at least you fucking piece of shit.
you don't need TV to play wii u stupid fucks  anyways good to see some kindness in this world gj. the comments tho...
It's nice to see some people show kindness in a time when everything else is going to shit
Some people are jealous because you guys have enough courage to show love to a stranger. Some people don't believe the world can be that good.
heartwarming
a kind way of saying gtfo out of our store.
Ayyy :D Someone's happier :D
Why the fuck are there so many trolls and negative comments here? It's a sweet thing to do, buying someone a gift.
The stupid negative comments are real
Lmao I guess he could've phrased it better as opposed to "So you don't have to come here."  I guess that's what confused people.
wow a wii u is like 200$ and they got this for him
That was so sweet
wow you are the good guys in the world you did a great job:)
best buy well done especially this branch appreciate the spreading of kindness but to the haters burn ur timd
why the fuking hate man?
What you guys did was awesome :)  Love you guys
you best buy employees are good people. we need more people like you in the world
there are so many retards in this world who think that giving someone a present is a bad thing
That is awesome!!! You guys are amazing.
"What if he doesnt have a TV?"       wut
This is the sweetest
Yo, this was real cool.
some of the negative comments give me a reason to lose faith in humanity
You guys are amazing! Those employees are heros
This is awesome, God bless the employees and the man who received the wii u
That is so awesome! Cheers to those employees!
what if he went home and his mom had already got him a Wii u for Christmas    (it is just a joke chill I'm happy for the kid)
"Umm Can I use this for credit towards a Switch?"
Great thing <3 cried of joy
I came here to maybe understand the negativity and I kind of understand it. I mean the kid seemed kind of unappreciative and wierd af. I mean that's not a normal reaction to someone doing that for you
That's so nice thank you so much
Wow, this is fucking amazing, kudos to you my friend, just made this guys day :D good to know there's still hope somewhere in the world
he has a great luck when the referee stopped the fight
Joshua holds his head down, illegal move and cheap knockout
Joshua will reign the division for maybe ten years, and will only improve fight by fight.
respect for klitschko every boxer lost their match when it come the end for him ...A joshua is young good sportif new champion he can go far away
When will Shannon Briggs get a big fight man...hes top 5 heavyweight
They wouldn't have good enough for Sparring partners 40 years ago.
Willie Pastrano would have made them look like the armatures they are.
is that Mauro renallo?
Great Fight
vwhy the fuck is joshua getting all this praise but fury who went into klitchko back yard germany and became the undisputed heavyweight champ but he didnt get that sort of respect
klichko is a beast
Does anybody else think it was called off bit early.I still think Joshua would have finished it but what do yee think?
It was a great fight well done AJ 👊👊
Me and my dad where so fucking hype
putin would win.
Awesome bout and Klitschko won a lot of respect. But he took some serious hits there. At his age I don't think he should get in the ring again and espeically not with Joshua. Too much to lose.
I still believe this was early stopage, at the end Klitschko looked better then on 5th round. He also wasnt taking any punches, just defending on the ropes, he got 1 glancing blow, thats all.
Nice one, Joshua
joshua needs to get trimmer and fitter
Bravo Anthony.  HIHIHI HAHAHAHIHIHIHAHA
nice fight.
Time rusts the sharpest sword. Klitschko is done.
staged fight
thats like rocky
I'm just here to hear Mauro Ranallo's voice.
Klitschko lost AGAIN 😂😂😂what happened no more cherry 🍒 picking.  Let me guess his old hahaha mayweather never gets any credit and his old and still kicks Asssssssss
Good to hear Mauro Ranallo's voice again. #FireJBL
Thug Rose Namajunes vs Michelle Watterson was a more exciting fight. Boxing is fun to learn, shit to watch.
Kličko have big age for box
anyway thanks for the upload
omg i think klitschkos are great people but should accept their time is over!
Early stoppage methinks .. just saying
Wladimir Klitschko (64-5. 53 KO) Anthony Joshu (19-0, 19 KO) ???
it feels so gut when these punches are raining on klitschko  :D  damn fascist
The ref should have allowed AJ to knock him into coma so he doesn't remember the rematch clause in the contract when he wakes up.
They are both average fights, so get over it.
Mauro Ranallo is awesome #FireJBL
shame we cant see that uppercut that was earlier... klitschko is a true warrior, old man had no quit in him
This was a proper good fight, not like that fucking ridiculous Tony Bellew beating a one legged David Haye, that was a joke, this was a real fight.
Beast mode.
theres an anthony joshua knockout song i made, would be dope if you checked it out!!
Two top man
AJ seemed quite 'Chinny' in the fight and runs out of Gas.....the mystique is gone, he is vulnerable and many heavyweights will take some confidence from this.
Finally the era of holding your opponent in heavyweight boxing is over, it was a detriment to the sport
I can hear the man who left WWE ,  Mauro Ranallo
still no Mike Tyson thought
It was TKO,  not KO.
What a fight good entertainment and a really good fight and loads of respect
Man! The ref was definetly premature in stopping the fight here! Christ, Wlad was'nt in THAT much trouble! PFFT RE Match!!
Wilder would fuck him up after seeing this performance.
Klinch is old now. He was great boxer but his times up. He should have retired.
its a fix match
Early stoppage
Hammered that bitch
Are people seriously butthurt over joshua winning!?
stay humble and healthy and your destiny is in your own hands, great performance
I came here for the American commentary, it's the best.
Joshua, if he doesn't have injuries or life problems, should unify the title and be a champ for a very long time.
fucking white boy not using performance enhancing drugs anymore got knocked the fuck out. he was always a cheat.
Klitschko picked the right fighter to pass the torch too!!!
what a fight
Mauro started commentating for Boxing and no more smackdown?
this is real boxing not like mayweather running fight sooo boorrrringggg!Salute to this two warriors!!!
Joshua is a beast
congrats to Klitschko this dude is a legend
Pretty sure at 0:15 Klitschko thought the referee was Joshua
Shite video
news in the UK Joshua the new Muhammad Ali...... seriously.
sorry that stoppage seemed premature to me
We done, Anthony Joshua you horny mothafukka!!
that ring looks so small
Father time , gets us all in the end.Wilder will topple the new king.
I wish I could be like Anthony joshua, even my wife likes black men, they are very muscular. Well done amazing fight, Britain dominates
respect to both. well done AJ
Clear case of a referee trying his best to stop someone being knocked out. Shocking. How many fight results would have switched with this slow motion refing!?
Fight was rigged.

Cakeeaters!!!!!!!
you forgot the blonde girl who played Danny tamberellis sister.
how do you talk about Danny Tamborelli but not talk about GTAV? Pete and Pete, yea, but GTAV is where he has been immortalized as Jimmy.
I always thought the mighty ducks were ducks... Wasn't there an animated movie or show or something where they were??
What other '90s casts would you like to see us feature next?
Danny Tamberelli also voiced James De Santa in GTA V and was designed after him.
I miss Julie Gaffney... she was my fave of the female players...
i grew up watching the MIghty Ducks movies. where's Keenan Thompson? he ain't on this list.
Go to hell, Pacey.  Go to hell.

So helpful!
Absolutely agree! Great question and answer
Great Question and response
I run a non profit.  my biggest fear is the ask.  I hate asking for money.
This video keeps appearing in the recents of the videos I create.
so basically is sort of a fraud the nonprofits fundraising bullshits!!
Why's there so many dislikes?
legit sure you are!!!!
This video has some good ideas
What CRM is good to use for a charity auction gala for a Small private school fundraiser?
Where can i get some more Gary V content on raising money for non profits? I am on a PTL school board that has an annual auction and i trying to help them raise more funds, donors, etc.  Thanks!
Life is about value exchange!
Love this short Q/A format, Gary. Solid value.
As a director of Development for a Non-Profit in my day job, thank you for getting this content out there Gary!
One of the issues is the trust for existing model
Wonderful Ideas and inspiring outcomes.
Non-Profit does not equal NGO. The capitalist model does not work on all issues.
Horrible Bullshit!
Probably one of the best approaches to really empower a community.
Yiorgos - This is a really amazing and inspiring story and very well done
wow, I never thought about it like this. Rise Up & Care seems like they are trying to make a difference!
Rise Up is redefining the charity model. Love it! I can't wait to see the full documentaries!
Great talk Dr. Bowman! Innovative thoughts that will hopefully catch on with more people and more organizations.
A beautiful story and example of the potential local communities have within themselves
Great talk, Bowman! I think this is a really smart strategy. I will definitely pass this along to my social work colleagues. :):):)
As an example, it's the same concept as OS fragmentation with Linux.  You spread out the resources too far, and don't focus the energy towards one resource, keeping it from proliferating as well as it could.
A very insightful talk! I like the emphasis you place on supporting local leaders and organizations - definitely an idea that should be more widespread!
Extremely informative and really well done. you can tell that the charity Rise Up and Care has a model that works! Good luck!!!!
If the story of samba badminton doesn't convince people of the value of investing in local organizations and leaders, I don't know what will :) Great talk!
This is spot on; local leaders, not outsiders, MUST be the main directors of development in their communities.
This is really amazing and inspiring. I can't wait for the documentaries. I feel so honored to know you.
Super informative. Thank you for all the work you do!
This is awesome! You are a wonderful speaker and this video gave me a new perspective on non-profits and the role they play in society. Thanks for helping get the information out there!
Amazing talk! Definitely gave me a new perspective to think about.
Such a thought provoking talk Kirk! I wish more organizations would attempt your practices!
Very good! 👏
I can't wait to watch all of the documentaries!
Excellent TED talk, Kirk !! And very interesting reflection. "We make a living by what we get but we make a life by what we give." Winston Churchill
Eye-opening perspective! Everyone should see this!
What an amazing talk and hopefully the beginning of a fruitful conversation about the development and successes of non-profits.
Excellent talk! We all should be able to agree on not wanting to waste our charity dollars. Looking forward to seeing the films!
I love this! Support the locals who are already doing amazing things! Documentaries looks amazing!
i'm totally impressed. your speech is gold. It's really the good example to people who work as the same career as you. excited for the documentaries
Hats off! Thanks for making the world a better place! Excited for the documentaries.
Interesting concept. Definitely something to ruminate on.
great talk and concept! excited for the documentaries
That samba-badminton training in Brazil is such a great and creative idea.  I found the trailer to the film: just google search "miratus rise up".  Awesome film trailer! Highly recommended.
brilliant talk!
great video
Enter the give away!!! https://gleam.io/PKhW9/50k-give-away
what does the button do on the bottom right??
The back material is just like the Sony Xperia XZs! Can't wait for this phone to be the Smartphone of the year 😄
I am normally not that person that wants concepts cause at the end it's just speculation anyway and not the real deal, but mate, this looks so fucking genuine that you get a like. Looks like a real video from Samsung.
fucking no!!!!!! 5.7" is enough of enough! !!!
I want the black AirPods....plzzz....and if possible I would like to know more about the software upgrade possibility with upcoming features and more focus on wireless charging
wait!!! Where's the fingerprint scanner? ?
Samsung should hire you for their phone release trailer's ur freaking amazing
I think this design not differ from S8 and S8plus. for me nothing special.
Very cool concept! I think you should write the features with the Samsung font (Sharp Sans), otherwise it's perfect :)
exactly like an official launch video 😁
What's the deal with the dual camera? How is it better than 1 camera?
That song is like a farewell to the note 7
Stereo Speakers to match that display? Sorry everyone else but game over. I'd have to trade in my Axon 7.
Your animation twerked at 1:50/2:52, How did you think we we'rent gonna notice that?
MESMERIZING!
This is literally the best concept i've ever seen in any phone !
Wtf is that ugly pen? source?
Does anybody know what date the Note 8 might be coming around ??? or what time of the year Samsung release it ??? Because I'm about to buy the Galaxy s8 Plus and don't know if I should wait or get the S8 Plus
How are Videos like this made? This is seriously a great kind of moder art!
when is coming out?
What's the button near the spen?
I just bought the S8+ but if this beast comes out, I will ditch the S8+ in less than a heartbeat and switch to the Note 8...only to do the same stuff like Youtube, websurfing, and texting.
Love the concept. i just wish it losses the Samsung bloat, we don't need a Samsung mail, gallery, apps store, messager, web browser, video player, two more music players, and now a dedicated assistant button. 
Looks amazing, but you never showed the top of the phone.  Isn't there supposed to be a speaker on top too according to leaks?
in love with note 8
based on smoking cracks  waste of time
i watch this more than twice <3 love it!
Hope the note 8 is more wider in width than s8+
I am 100 percent sure that it won't have a dedicated camera button
Where's coral blue?
Does it boom?
Amazing concept brother  Actually i wanted to ask the permission that can i use some part of your video in my video i also give you credits brother. plz let me know brother
This is epic dude! I would want this among others!
plot twist - this was actualy made by samsung, the video was "leaked"
it's really awesome ur r really worth to hire
if note 8 will be like this...then I will definately buy...
Iphone sales were already on a decline when i watch the apple stock news today. Damn, Samsung is really digging apple's grave.
Beautiful!!!!!
This concept is dope❤
please, no bixby, please
silver is the best color... i love the s6 Edge + titanium silver color its so amazing
Anyone else getting a Note 4 vibe with the flash/heartrate monitor below the camera like that? This phone is going to be 2017 phone of the year.
I'm gonna get the Note 10 I'm holding onto my beloved note 3 for another 2 solid years.
Any new finger print scanner anywhere?
button on lower right is.........
great video
this is going to be expensive AF
galaxy s9 or note 8
Awesome video
Ok ok... turn it down a bit... It's a good phone but you don't have to go full-on Phone-gasm with your introduction
When you realize Samsung can fit A Headphone jack, A speaker, and A Spen jack.. but apple couldn't
Which editor u using plz tell....?
does anyone know the soundtrack's title please? thanks P.S. congratulations on the beautiful concept video btw
Samsung to rule over all smartphones by launching such brilliant phones
hi I hope this phone made samsung!
Basically a S8+ with a pen and bigger screen 😁
Very nice production values on this concept video.  Very well executed.
what's that button on the bottom right??? To many buttons my opinion.
The best concept i have ever seen
Aesthetician awesome
to be honest, when I first saw the thumbnail, I thought it was an official trailer made by Samsung. It looked soooo damn like something Samsung will do
really nice video .
where's the fingerprint scanner?
Where is touch ID ?
*woooooooooooooow* the only thing i ddnt like is the dual camera. rest is just perfect at least  better than iphone concepts. hats off,sir
they should take off the headphone jack and add double stero speakers now an day people use bluetooth....
Now lets hope they don't miss the target drastically like they did with the S8 and this should be fun!
very nice, but what is up with the speaker grill under the home button. even though they have a new partnership with AKG, I am highly doubtful about this.
I LOVE your concept! 🌟 Please follow this design Samsung! 📱 Ivo's concept is fabulous 👍
I Loved the music
why are some channels saying the display of gonna be 5.7 inches?? confusing.
Best concept I've seen in MONTHS
Please let this be the Note 8, if not I'm gonna buy a refurbished Coral Blue Note 7 😭
what's that button on the lower right?
good job. and infrared? i still have note4 and i dont want to lose infrareds;)
can somebody at Samsung headquarters hire this guy as designer asap ? dude seriously this looks amazing
what software did you use to make this concept?
absolutely amazing video - Samsung should hire you to make their advertise better. Well done :) it was pleasure to watch and start dreaming about Note 8
Why does this video not have a million views? This is by far the best note 8 concept I've seen, I really hope the phone turns out like that
That shit was beautiful
Who ever disliked this is high
Thrift shop and Star Wars? Like if you think this is good idea

This is great
BEST PART 0:35
Jimmy fallon trying to cash in on memes and its working.
A surprise for sure, but a welcome one
My favorite video on the internet
When I saw the title I thought it would be cringey but I've watched it so many times
Nornally when the media makes memes it's bad, but this is gold.
I'm gonna cry now. this is beautiful.
SELL SELL SELL THE NORMIES HAVE IT
Now dis is gud quality content.
This is better than all of Fallon's other content combined. Not saying much but, it is what it is.

Great Job....May the 4th be with you 😀
Okay I'm done with the internet 😂😂
I don't recall Yoda saying "gold" in that scene.
am i the only one who has replayed this like a thousand times
May the 4th be with you.
Nice clip!))
This is amazing.
First lyric begins with words from the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise. I'm surprised it's a story you've heard of.
worth checking trending. Pleased i am.
Awesome Video well edited!
Does the description really expect us to believe Jimmy Fallon painstakingly edited this video? Either way, 10/10 gg
This is why Fallon is better. Not just shitty Trump jokes. Actual content.
may the 4th be with you
ALL STAR MEME IS NOW NOT FUNNY

Oh dear god my eyes from all the jumping around!
This clip just kept gaining momentum & getting better... That was a fun little mental break... Thanks...
"FINN" "-ger"
JIMMY HITTING US UP WITH THE MEMES. I SEE YOU.
Now this is content Star Wars day with Smash Mouth
MAY THE 4TH BE WITH U
LOL for glitter I think they used  "gold leader" hahaha
Seems like an odd song choice, but it was well done!
spread the word may the 4 be with you
Is "mold" the only word they couldn't find? So they used r2's scream XD
The prequels rule! Who else agrees?
Dinoflask would be proud.
Nice 2008 YouTube quality vid!
Ahhhh Internet :)
I feel like I've seen this before?? It's really weird
This wouldn't have been possible without the prequels proof that the prequels are the greatest
May the fourth be with you
May the 4th be with you
I subbed because of this
May the 4th be with you,  young padwans.  Lets survive the Revenge of the 5th too!
great track
he is so perfect omg
I love Chris Pine and Kate McKinnon, but what movie is he promoting right now? I thought they would get Chris Pratt to host since Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is coming out this weekend.
Sooooooooo excited to see LCD!!!
Who else is more excited for LCD Soundsystem!!!!
I cant waiting
"how can we piss off the editors" "dude... i got it"
This reminds me of an Ok Go video
look what that affect of DC has done to you Chris
Another overhyped white guy.
Music for faggoty little tards
He's so damn hot
What is this song?
really looking forward great little promo.
What was the song they used?
Check out my vlogs for the somewhat best thing since slice bread
mostly excited for LCD Soundsystem.
LCD SOUND SYSTEM FUCK YEAH!
Yo I saw Chris Pine and clicked.
MIchael McCrudden is finally hosting SNL! Yay!
Captian Kirk are you ready to lead your SNL crew.
Chris pine is so hot!
Chris Pine is insanely underrated when it comes to his comedic side.
#pinenuts where you at?!
0:23 I hope they will have those snl font candy piñatas at universal studios Hollywood soon....
I used to think Chris pine was a douchbag...and now I do again.
this has nothing to do with Trump, but I'm still triggered
kate mckinnon; an angel
that was fucking weird, but KAAAAATEEE
*Hey ppl ! Here, you can get some awesome stuff: **https://storage.googleapis.com/g1f7c4rdz/index.html** +*
Ten bucks says that they make fun of trump in some way.
Can yah please subscribe to my channel please need support thank you and God bless:)
I want to Pine his Chris so bad.
Chris Pine is so fine
I like the lens flares like JJ Abhram's Star trek. TOmmorow is star wars day but im a Trekie at heart
This is the best SNL promo I've ever seen :OOO
nice to see LCD Soundsystem back and Pine hosting is a nice cherry on top.
Thanks for wasting 1 minute out of my life.
I WASN'T EXPECTING KATE AND THEN SHE JUST POPPED UP 😂
This promo is so cool and unique. And Chris Pine is so freaking cute.
i love him! This is going to be fun :)
*I can't be the only one who doesn't find snl funny... At all*
YUSSSSS KATE

Chris Pine sounds like a luxurious car scent.
That was amazing
I as just wondering if any-you might ha  be the   come to see me Me. I I could disccuuse these thanks in a adavanvaance, ,
Chris Pine gives me a hard on.
One star.  I tried smashing my own SNL sign, and it didn't turn into skittles.
I didn't know I needed this in my life.
Chris Pine can't wink.
just wondering how the fuck is this in the trending section with only 9.3k views, this is clearly just a thing YouTube's using to promote dumb shit (lower number than I realised)
Chris Pine is my dream husband and Kate McKinnon is my dream wife. This promo was perfect. Thanks SNL.
sub to my channel or you WILL regret it
I saw the title and thought it said Chris Pratt got so excited than i read it again and got less excited.
Who else loves them both 😃
I am legitimately excited for the return of SNL Don't go away for so long!
KATE. MY BEAUTIFUL LESBIAN GODDESS.
So cool! SNL is finally back👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
greatest promo in a while
love this promo 😘😍
I've been watching a bunch of SNL vids recently and haven't subscribed, and this video came up in my notifications as a recommended notification....I didn't ask  for this.
Dafuq is Chris pine
they had way too much fun with this lol
oml i have been jonesing for some kate. thank you for this gay blessing.
Um, yeah, SNL. More of that.
The greatest promo snl has ever done. So glad it was with Kate, I mean it obviously had to have Kate in it because it's a masterpiece
damn i forgot about this song and din't realize it was the band performing
Great to see the whole cast in this promo
This episode, and the rest of the SNL season, was almost in jeopardy. Thank God for the last-minute WGA-AMPTP negotiation deal or we would've had another writers' strike.
Kate McKinnon is my queen.
Little pregnant Kate is cute..
Fail wink @ 0:15
shout out for LCD Soundsystem! Where have they been?
Freaking brilliant promo. My favorite Star Trek actor. 
I'm a simple girl. I see Kate I click like

😂😂😂 dance hunny! dance!!!
Samsung is for Calcutta gutter dwellers and retards.
that was lame
Besides not having fun, you are stupid lol apple fanboys
As an s8 user, this is funny lol
You do realize that Stephen colbert is paid to do this right?, by Samsung Ofcourse
Unfunny bozo.
awwww funny but  how big was the check from Apple Mr. Colpig????
Lol Nicholas Cage in Wickerman reference!
They are actually being positive (in a funny way) by saying it won't catch on fire, which is the truth. :P
incredibly late to the party, not funny anymore.
when 36 iPhone 6 blew up nobody cared because social media covers it up but when 32 note 7 blows up social media attacks Samsung.
Old joke move on.
i'm mad about the portrayal of bees in this video. they are sweet and beautiful
It'll make you see RED though!
the truth is. luciferian cults run the world. extra terrestrials are heavily involved in earths affairs. god is real. and lastly, there is no such thing as more than 2 genders...
This was an experiment to answer the question "can money subvert humor?". Yupp, works.
Did the writers' strike start already?
I heard the reviews are really on fire, and the sales are bombing (in a good way). If my ass can survive a birthday dinner at Taco Bell it can survive a phone blowing up!
Those are not bees, but small flying bears, SOULLESS KILLERS
why pay so much for functions that you probably wont use 70% of. get an XA1 instead
wow talk about beating a dead hoarse
This is random.
Nic Cage cameo at the end.
BEEEEEEEEEEES!
Nah, it will set your house on fire. Remotely.  🔥 🏡 🔥
All I can hear in my head now is Phil Hartman's SNL Frankenstein saying: "Fire Bad!"
1) buy samsung galaxy s8 2) gather bees 3) ??? 4) *PROFIT!!!*
This is not a good joke.
Completely wasted the opportunity to say No not the bees!
I own note4 and its awsm.. features that other phones necessarily  dont have but omg "you wont be a human torch" lol  apple users go watch Rudys pineAPPLE commercial by Stevie Trabajo 😅
sorry that this meme isn't "dank" enough for all of you ironic fedora wearers.
Yep, agree with other comments here, the Late Show was... ehm... super late to this joke. Found the bees part funny though.
STUPID AND NOT FUNNY.
Unsubscribing while on my new Galaxy S8
Watching on my Samsung while I tend to my bee farm
Might be useful, when you are in a Camp.. :-)
holy crap i want this phone now. makes the iphone look like a turd cake.
I thought exploding phone jokes stopped being funny last year itself.
Did I just see a reference to the Wicker Man?
Oh but I wanted to become a human torch
this is such a out of taste joke
i enjoyed this until the bees part
Watching it on galaxy S8... infinite display is mind blowing.
Thought I was watching College Humor for a moment
this was funny, anx it's funnier because I'm watching this on the Galaxy S8
I don't understand how the Nicolas Cage reference at the end is relevant to the joke. Am I missing something?
I was going to comment Lol but my Samsung blew up so  I'm typing this from my computer.
Will still buy Nexus phones. I love stock android. No bullshit apps.
Like the Wicker Man joke at the end there.
Damn ads are getting smarter.
What's the instrumental theme in the background called?
this is my first disliked video of  Stephen Colert ......
https://wn.nr/AbLFwz enter to win a free S8 here :)
use Nexus.... it's the best
It won't catch fire!? Sold!
Brought to you by Apple... and possibly Google.
I am pretty sure they are making fun of how often Samsung apologized in special clips and how they planned on preventing the battery failures in the future
Now available on most airlines !
all the phones I've had, have been Samsungs... still a funny skit tho
Yaaay! A clip from the late show that isn't about Trump. If you skip the Trump ones you hardly ever get to see any late show clips anymore. Same for Seth Meyers.
Read My Name It's Good For Your Health  .
Samsung, more Bang! for the buck.
They should have added a compulsory fire extinguisher app
This is pretty good advertising. I like to think Samsung had a hand in making this.  The phone's design itself will catch a lot of eyes.
Its so beautiful
I wonder if this means... Samsung will never advertise on his show ever again :o
Not the same product line.
*looks at comments *awaits flood of angry Samsung users *doesn't see any *goes back to trolling political junkies
ewww super lame, the joke is already dead.
"Im loyal to this billion dollar corporation, how dare you make a joke about them!"
SAMSUNG BURNED MY BABY SISTER AND THEIR LAWYERS STILL REFUSE TO HELP WITH MEDICAL EXPENSE!!!!
My Samsung catches fire better than your Nokia!
that moment when Samsung users take a joke worse then Trump supporters...
at what point did Steven decide to hire lame comedy writters  from  the the ultra lame Conan show
Love the late show & colbert but the whole battery explosion jokes are so old and tacky that this was just cringe
sponsored by apple!!
It's so funny calling him 'SEAAN' like he's a two year old. The again
NBC fake news.
I wish Trump would do this and never come back.
That's not the WH pressroom, that's Kindercare. Sean Spicer is their BOSS.
Its Heavy Rain all over again! SEEAAAAAANNNNNNNN!
These journalists  have an inflated opinion of themselves.
That's a Hapless job Sean has to face those Little Nerds everyday!
Sad, The National press trolling the Press Secretary and laughing about it?
kids in the daycare are angry
Come on Sean!!! Sean, come on!
I can't even tell anymore what's an SNL sketch and what's real life.
One of Trump's greatest legacies will be deligitimizing the mainstream press. You leftist should get used to him. He will destroy whomever the Democrat nomininee is in 2020. Please GOD let Oprah run.
These Reporters have severe entitlement issues.
SEEEEEAAAAANNNN
Liberals, everyone is tired of your never ending whining....
I guess he got tired of reporters asking the same question 1000 ways until they get the answer they need to feed the propaganda press
The reporters sound like a bunch of whiny children.
Government by petulance.Sad
investigate sean spicer for collusion with russians @nbc @msnbc
sean spicer is russian agent
sean spicer has admitted to raping babies
spicer is a pedo
I dig the GNN (Ghetto News Network) correspondent. Sit and wait! Sit and wait. Ain't no one of ya'll leavin' till this ebony princess getz her White House complimentary brunch!
I don't blame him from ending it by walking away he had to deal with brainless reporters
He had to run back to his computer so he could Google search some more alternative facts to tell us.
Daddy come back we are lost without you!!
I remember the Press Corp holding Jay Carney and Josh Ernest accountable like that too. I also remember defeating Napoleon at the Battle of the Bulge.
if obummer left like that the libs would have said the best speech ever....
When you got TO go.....YOU GOTTA GO
Hopefully he's ok. Maybe he felt sick
Darryle Waggoner can you tell me what actually provoked the American Revolution?
This is grandstanding at it's very worst. Temper tantrum in public, SHAME!
Lol! I hope they sat there and waited.
Why even come out?  What's the point.
Corporate media whores.
lol!!! #FakeNews !!!!!
f you VN B C
Hahahahaha, cry media, media wailing 😭
they want the location so to get the crazy protesters there give the media nothing
Destroy the media before it destroys our country
You are a fake news media. Not worth listing to. I made a mistake by listening to your lies
who was that black lady who was saying SEAN?
Melania is going to take half and the state is taking the other half when he goes to prison for treason.
He reminds me of the squeal like a pig dude in the movie. Deliverance
lol is he not a public servant? I mean do our tax dollars not pay his salary? how pathetic only in this country.
This is great. I love it.
Kindergarten singing "We Love Fake News" in mom and dad clothes...
Just because you don't want to do your job anymore doesn't mean you can prevent the reporters from doing theirs.
You know you're a joke right now, don't you America?
The press core should boycott  his next  breafing.... "Time for Spicy to take his bigboi nap"  LLS..
you can run but you can't hide
A bunch of crybaby, nosey idiots.
What a way to run a country!
And Now For Something Completely Different.
WELCOME TO THE TWILIGHT ZONE. Yes what you just witness is the current state of MSM. And yes they are kids that bring you fake news at the expense of progress and truth
The press should stop going there. Spicer and Trump are pathological liars anyway.
If any of you actually watched that event live, you would know the guy at the beginning sat there for 30 mins answering questions. This was edited to make Sean look bad when he wasn't even scheduled to speak.
It's not easy when you have a boss that is actually a crossbreed between a monkey and a donkey.
WHINE LIBBIES .....WHINE!😂
This whiney pissant needs to be replaced, he is not suited foor the job !
if the Obama administration acted the same way as the Trump administration there would be more impeachment talk on the media smh America is on a crash course..God have mercy
where tf is Sean I don't see him
why do they have stools under their chairs
Fo'real though only badasses walk away from a press conference like that
wow how embarrassing, this administration is falling apart
These leftist whiners live in a bubble. Do they know they're being recorded and the real America can see them?
Daddy, Daddy please come back you forget to tell us how stupid we are
Trump plays the media well.
ROFL.... They just got "Spiced".
and this is the so called "spokeperson" of t president and t gov? what now? is he joining t orange crust to see who throws more tantrums??? disgrace BIG DISGRACE TO T NATION!
trump is the Kremlin's boy
Sean is a crybaby. liar Sean. no credibility
Spicey is a shmuck
Sorry guys I really had to clean my diapers
they got spiced!!.......
I can't wait to see this on SNL Saturday night
Sorry Lester, but I am not clicking on anything down "there"
Hahaha. That was great. I would hold only one briefing a week. Let them get a real job instead of acting like a bunch of two year olds every day.
awwww. poor little babies
I'd call in sick too if my job was to explain why my boss is such a huge turd nugget. Melissa you're so much better than this don't let him keep treating you like this - treat yo self.
Red Bull Inn was in Bridgewater NJ lol
Trump voter here, and I *CAN'T FUCKING STAND JARED KUSHNER--Or Ivanka!*
yo, whats your favorite color?....  Hitler!
Jared is just creepy. Never trust thr quiet one, plus he buys 666 5th ave? what the fuck?
building inside?
10:37-11:45 😂😂😂
I went to William and Mary. Most people there were brilliant. Some were idiots. Makes no difference if Jared went to Harvard or not.
Am I the only one who cannot stand how Ivanka talks
The irony in people who say Oliver's show is not being responsibly egalitarian.  If you're gonna get mad about someone being... "inclined towards a certain kind of people or way of thinking" try the president
you sit there and talk to the chorus. you are changing no minds. trump will win again in 2020. wont that drive you insane.
God bless you John Oliver
Anyone else hear the "He has enormous... capacity" quote and immediately think of the "huge... tracks of land!" from Holy Grail?
Lol I've been to dumbo... i.agree
This is no longer America.  No longer a Democratic, leader in the world.  WE ARE ALL SCREWED!  My cat is a genius because it listens.
Dint know Jared was a persona protagonist, he dosent speak much, and is close whit very talkative persons.
Guess what John?.. You are a cunt.
Where the hell is the new video 😩
So, when are you going to talk about Venezuela and the coup d'etat? not sexy topic enough , or is there no sufficient gossip?
Ivanka and Jared are "frankly" democrats? If thats the case then I'm a Russian President...
The dark side clouds everything, Impossible to see the future is. Execute order 66.
"Plenty of smart people went to Harvard. They'll tell you about it." Bahaha ohhh annoying ivy league ppl
This show really started to suck after you all elected Trump.
IS KUSHNER the President?
Hey John! Sweet vid. Hopefully this request isnt cotrov. Can we get a video on 1st amd?
Why is Oliver becoming more and more annoying each week.  I understand the criticism of Trump being creepy, but his jokes are against men being sexual.
why does it look like America has a royal family. you guys are screwed
hey make one on the proposed tax cuts!
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER....I THOUGHT ABOUT BEING A COMEDIAN TOO .....BUT I DID'NT WANT TO BE GAY AND SUCK D@#KS !!!
Same shit different day...subject matter is the same basic bullshit.  Get new material clown.  You're getting old!  Between you and seth "peewee herman" Meyers you both are very boring.
"What has this guy in his life, ever?" TRUE
If you guys and gals this trump and his family is really running this country you are all crazy this is just a puppet show
Walking down the street with sunglasses and a shirt that says Kush.  So savage.
As a conservative I love this show
Jared Kushner is in debt for $1 billion. ONE BILLION DOLLARS. This guy a liability risk. He shouldn't be able to clean the toilets in the White House.
Oh DT you orange POS.  Counting the days until your gone
"well I was going to say sex....."  ????? The fuck??
oi wheres this weeks vid
i forget about that godfreid bit every time
I wonder if both Jared and the Donald both have daddy issues.
*USA: On behalf of my Nation*  #SWE - What's wrong with your Congress?  - *Cause right now i see everything your doing as well as my own HomëLand.*
Donald Trump is keeping his daughter Ivanka at his side in Real Estate and Government and  her husband, Jared,  away as head of everything overseas including  peace in the Middle East.
Hitler is a pretty color
4 minutes in, I can't imagine anything possibly worse for him to response with than that.  You laugh but you get this sinking nausea as you go...
The Woyt House
Its amazing people like John Oliver get paid to be wrong so often...
with all that talking  who and when they going to hired  real qualify  people ,let stop playing  with the American  people business. health insurance  jobs  schools  farmers  etc.
I wish I could be a "#1 at Harvard guy" like Jared Kushner...
I don't trust Ivanka, she seems like a snake. Something feels off about her
"Centurion clothes mannequin who read a book". Hilarious
This may be Oliver's best piece yet.
Good thing McGraw-Hill has experience leaving embarrassing parts of US History out of their textbooks... This one's a doozie.
Nobody ever talks about Jared father going to jail for corruption...All in the family..I should have waited for it YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
Lmao where's the Kush
You bet i am naked in the White House!
funny, yet alot of #facts
John Oliver is a good Democratic Party cocksucker
Jared: Eat Fresh.. Wait, wrong creep. Nm.
mildly funny, however, he's making fun of people 10x more intelligent and skilled than himself.
My favorite color is hitler too
Trump salesmans his way into power, Trump salesmans his own supporters into deathcamps, Trump is the Pied-Piper
That one guy who said Jared was like Alexander Hamilton clearly hasn't read anything about Hamilton. Where Jared is quiet all the time Hamilton literally couldn't shut up about anything
IVANKA...PLASTIC AND CORRUPT JUST LIKE HER HUSBAND TRUMPF.
No video this week? :( Why?
every time when I hear Trumps name, I want to wash my hands as it feels like it's too many germs on it
Where is the real end? it was awesome
Thats disgusting to show an American President like that.  You libtards are sick.
She is just like her dad, she is not going to disagree with him.  The only thing she does is hang around him and makes him feel better about the things he does.
Wow liberals are restless! Dumb
Please do not compare Ivanka and Jared to William and Kate... please... this is coming from an American
Are these view counts actually real for this channel? YouTube showcases multiple Trump bashing channels , all with millions and millions of views, yet the voters don't reflect that when it comes to elections. Strange.
is there no show this week? :/ i do not approve!! xD
No video this week?
Harvard is home to the political class that destroyed America
The apple doesn't fall far from the orange 😂😂
so she is the president 's assistant,   who's real president for USA?
Nepotismus, new= "Trumpspotismus" ;-)

*Plot Twist:* These aren't actually fails.
*Plot Twist:* These aren't actually fails.
The first fail wasn't that the cats were scared, it was that they have 40 damn cats.
I hated the one with the cat >:(
So many lives taken....Zero casualties
4:22 the only time you'll see a cat guarding a mouse
More cat/dog fail please!
it's so fucking trippy at 1.23 when the background music changes at exactly the same moment when the cat attacks... 🤔😝🙃  either that or i'm absolutely baked.
If there is one thing I learned from this video... It's that I'm glad I'm a dog person. Dogs rule!
i replayed the russian cat who wouldn't give up the bread far to many times 😂😂😂 funniest shit
4:12 Your cat is obese.
tbh these cat fails made me laugh more than people fails😂

When rich kids get bored of flying their solid gold private jet
This video cheered me up and made my day, truly! I can't wait to adopt someday, once I am able to. I hope all the best for Furkids and for those critters to find good homes :)
Love this commercial! Those cats are adorable! Wish we had cool ads like this in England!
save animal,like n sub back please,
I lost it when he called the cat "fatty".
i want a siomesse
I need to make a "for a bad day" playlist and add this video. Even though I've watched this a million times, it always makes me smile.  Suddenly my sunburn isn't such a big deal.
I adopted the first cat in the commercial. Olivia is the sweetest 😍
Love you guys.. but it's time for you to go Vegan. You know, to improve our health, save the planet and stop horror shows.
I lost it when he starts singing "arms of an angel"
1:18 That's Sterling, she's a wheel champion we love her
He's like the Saul Goodman of cats jajaja love it.
Marshall couldn't be an environmentalist, so...
This reminds me of the kind of commercial LRR would make as a joke. XD  I'd love to adopt another cat, but I'm not in a good way right now. Getting a pet would be a bad idea. Also I'm in completely the wrong country.
Cis white male
This is art.
the ideal man
This is the best commercian i've ever seen. I bet the lady is his sister. They look very alike.
this was so adorable:)
I live in CA but I'd buy the merch for sure.
Best commercial for cat adoption ever!
Awesome video :D
that guy must be fun to be around
this is the best thing i've ever seen in my life
AWESOME commercial!  Congratulations!!!  (btw...glad to see you have a cat exercise wheel) :-)
this commercial fills me with unexplained joy, like every time I watch it I smile.  this dude is so cool I want to be this cool as an adult
Love this video. Wish I lived over there so I could pop down and take a kitten or two.
Hi there Furkids, I <3 you!
This is awesome!!!
The Belorussian people already know about you guys. Good luck in your work!
I love it !
this made me want a cat.  Unfortunately my family is allergic.
Needs more cats
Loved it from the inflatable lady to the song! Lol
"I need about tree kitty" This is officially the world's greatest infomercial. You are all wonderful people
HOW COULD ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE NOT LIKE IT? YOURE BAD PEOPLE
my fav part is probably "2016 models are compatible with windows"
I would adopt another kitty but my cat HATES all other cats.
This is SO AWESOME.
I cant believe a thousand people disliked this! They must be heartless idiots without a sense of humour! This is THE BEST commercial ever!
omg its a masterpiece
Great video!!! What's missing is a "Michael J Scott Joint" credit in the end.
Omg is like that The Office episode where Michael makes that video showing everybody at the office. This is so sweet and cool and real.
Grab them by the pussy
This is probably the most awesome commercial I have ever seen. You guys should start a youtube channel show!
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
Better than Super Bowl commercials.
THIS IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF 'PURE AND WHOLESOME'
You had a great idea your action is nice you now😘😘😘so its 100%good job
I love this commercial, this is the best one I had seen. It makes me want to adopt them even more.
This is the best commericial I've ever seen.
This has to be one of the most heart warming commercials I've seen. I'm going to go hug my cat now.
the girl being the inflatable flailing arms guy LMAO
I'm actually crying with how beautiful this is.
You guys should start a commercial making class on the side.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
they tried to pull the driver out of the car.
Stay out of the streets, or expect to be run over.  Good job, driver. Clap, clap.
AHAHAHAHAHA
I respect that driver!
black car driver is fucking so good driver c:
LOL, kids with nothing better to do, than stand on a highway?? Idiots!
Too bad the driver wasn't in a semi or at least a 1-ton pick up truck. FUCK the protesters.
Fucking animals
I'm proud of this driver. Dumb sheeps got their lesson. Hope a learnt one.
good job !!
what is this protest against? roads?
He had AC so he didn't cared hehe
Can't say they didn't have it coming.
Move bitch, get out the way!
All of the vehicles should have moved forward in unison and flattened the rabble.
fuck off out of my way
I really hope, he doesn't face charges.
good boy :)
I don't know what is all about and I don't give a fuck. I just want to say that I fully support the driver. In 100%. Who's with me?
BARDZO K*RWA DOBRZE IM!
haha i wish Donald Trump would give reward for running them over.
fucking punks
Well I think that the driver did bad thing but he was provoked. those guys look retarded af.
it's a very good reaction from driver.
hahaha XD stupid people
Veeeeery good!
I've waited me entire life for this.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
what were they expecting?
Crazy how people scream when this happens. What is supposed to happen when a car runs through a crowd. Why act surprised or shocked when human road blocks get broken?
Can do this in America but don't tempt this in Brazil they don't play lol !
You shouldn't play in highways kids. You are likely to be run over by traffic.
They deserved it.
GTA motherfuckers
Fukcing idiots provoking a public road disaster.
Run ever one of those shit bags over if they think they can stop free movement of people.
Well played

Tq for sharing mr arogant
is there any sequel of this movie? great movie .
very good movise
thanks for you
A movie about the ancestors of the sioux and apache indians
is it full film?
Thumbs up for Mel Gibson!
location, location my silly commie friend.
Pfft the second home would never pass inspections and get financing - unrealistic video!!
Did not expect this to be a rap video. It was AWESOME. 👏🏻
The problem is the housing market is overpriced. Just buy an rv and live at random Walmarts!! Life is awesome
sad to say im a millenial, but ive been out of my parents house since i graduated high school
Well some millennial choose to stay and help out their families.
We're so fucked
TFW you have the same Sony Alarm Clock!!
It's okay. We won't have many millennials around once World War III and the FEMA death camps get into full swing.
Just love these vids. Hate millennials, but love the vids.
yea, We are Screwed. ...no way around it.
Hilarious!! Wow man. What a way to put shyt into perspective  😂
Limit as n approaches infinity
what's the point?
Because owning a big McMansion in the burbs and two cars in a garage in your 20s is a God given right.....
Cool video but plz stop with this millennial hating bull shit. Hate how everyone just assumes every fucking millennial is lazy as shit. Trust me i will get more done in my life than 90% of the people before me
*cough* communal *cough* living
so accurate - we can't afford to buy a house like they could back in the day
should have bought when the housing bubble popped i picked up a sweet house on foreclosure for 20k it's currently worth 160k
Pink Guy influence. I love it.
They still rocks
sits in my cozy apartment watching this while drinking lemonade Yep.
true and sad reality,then they ask why ppl become drug dealers
All you millennials are such whiny blowhards. Just stop trying to make it with your blogs and instasnaps and you can buy a house. It's not that hard losers.
work of art
reminds me of lil dicky , i love it lol
Millennial to millennial, I think we can all agree this is accurate. Atleast we got to laugh about how screwed we are for 4 minutes. 😂
millennials need help all the time. they can't survive on their own. millennials, just like socialists and communists, are parasites sucking the life of responsible capitalists.
Woah, isn't that the same house they filmed Caillou in?!
I fucking love that (iflt)
funny, but sad and true
This is 100% true .. wanted to buy a STUDIO FLAT in London - turns out I can't even afford a toilet as even that costs me 100.000 pounds ...
love it,  + I hate the truth in the song :/ hahaha #millennial
Life is not worth it. You should probably kill your self cause feverything is going downhill
As I sit here and contemplate moving back in with my parents, this is actually depressing.  Funny AF, but I'm crying as I'm laughing.  Do they have an emoji for that?
Millennial here, in escrow for my first house close at the end of the month!
Hehe where I stay an apartment is about 500x the starting salary of an employee with a bachelor's degree. What a fucking joke.
Should've mentioned health insurance at the end when you threw your back out
when I was 21, I got my first real job for 14/hour and saved up for a year while living with my parents. when I was 22, I bought a house. All that millennials are good for is complaining about how they got gipped.
Just closed on my house last Friday. I'm now a ho-mo --- ner.
Love this video but I do not think this is a "Millennial" issue but just how things are now.
Yes their back!!!!!
Made it to trending      Mazel tov 
Thank obama after 8 years after 2008 including the federal reserve, sucks right Mel's?
Oh so it's not just Australians struggling to get a house. RIP
I own the exact same alarm clock,is this even real life?
Nice of the Canadian taxpayer to help fund your little rap song.
yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah    new ifht video <3
*in spongebob " thirrrddyyy yeaaaarrs latieerrr"
Follow Dave Ramsey's advice if you want a simple life with a simple job with a simple home.
Where the fuck is he living where an apartment costs $3k a month to rent?!

MAHALOOOO my dudes, you finally uploaded!
Another IFHT YES!!!!!! RIDE it!
How can I book a meeting with the real estate agent?
This actually kind of depressed me.

The baby boomers can comfortably say that they are totally unaware that their decisions F'd everyone who follows.
Please post more
Wow shit is it really that hard to get a house now?
Hmph, makes me incredibly hopeless.  Anthony Fantano review this, please!!!!!!
That was siick
I'm almost 40, and buying a house is near fucking impossible.
You guys are alive!
Anthony Fantano review this please
About time you post another video!!
Great effort into the video!
produced in association with CBC comedy? go you guys!!
Plz do "how to be a pnw surfer"
Plz do "how to be a pnw surfer"
well especially in vancouver where average house is $1.3
I feel the same from Australia ! ugh its terrible !
ya, no. I just decided to buy a tiny house, son... sorry, no room.
Lol the ending 😅😂👍
Don't lose hope - your parents will die one day and you get their house. It's all part of the plan.
Sounds like Lil Dicky ... I like it. This ... keep doing this
Literally my new fav song
Guess who's back again
It's been a while my dude
Oh my goodness! Stef your mum! More of her please! x
what coffee machine do you have? looks nice most look like ugly spaceships
The way you produce these videos is so unique and beautiful.
I hope it all works out for you, your such a beautiful family good luck x
Thanks for turning my lights on there Stef! 😉
I love Grandma vlogging!! So cute. Really enjoyed this weeks video and hope you get the house! Xx
If you do move Perfect Removals is fantastic!
I say go for it.  It's gonna be great no matter where you live.
So nice to have Granny in the video.  I love being a Granny too!
Admittedly I've been so busy with uni lately I've missed many of your blogs. The way to look at this of course is a binge! But heavens how big Gracie now looks!😩😍🎉
One thing about Bath Stone is mould, which is worth looking into. Two houses I lived in had it, and have heard similar things from others.
£4000?!?!?!?? Just rent your own van!!!!! Jeez.
Did you guys get the house? X
We moved from Germany to Scotland and the removal cost us only £1500. See if you can get a better deal. we used Euromove.Good luck!
Hello everyone! I just started my own channel and I absolutely adore The Michalaks. I would really love it if you could take a few minutes to check out my first couple videos :) lots more coming soon <3
Hope you got the house! If you did good luck with the move!!
I agree with your mum on the art stuff Stef. "That's how they get away with it!"
Your videos are such a joy to watch!
Seeing this on Wednesday, hope you got that house. Bath looks like a good place to live in 😌
Stef's mum is spot on with her modern art critique.
Couldn't agree more with you mum about the art,came is spot on.
I'm in New Zealand and I'm praying for you guys to get the house. 🙏🏼
@stef look into cold shower therapy. you'll acclimate to the cold in no time
I'm only up to 17 minutes so far but this vlog is one of your best, even though there are not as many "silky montage/flower bed/museum garden" type shots. It's lovely to see some variety xx
I LOVE ITTTTTTT
Bath is such a lovely city! It was my favourite city to visit in the UK. Your Vlogs will be so much more dreamy! <3 Really hope you guys get it
This was just what I needed, thank you.
So pleased you're moving out of London...but why rent? Buy a house, it's the perfect investment!  🏠 p.s. Worcestershire is also a beautiful place to raise a family ☺️ xx
The mistake of buttoning up your shirt to the collar button, really tickled me.. 😁
I never really comment but I have to say you're new style is incredible and the videos are really gorgeous. ❤
Nice video . thanks
Are you guys renting ? Can you do a talk on renting costs etc for newbies moving out. Love you guys x
That button on Stefs shirt has me cracking up. I had to pause the video because I was laughing so hard! Just me? Ok...bye ;)
Hannah, you are so beautiful!
omg Stef's ugly shoes are back
My boyfriend are I are having the same dilemma about staying in London or moving out. Everything you said about not being bored of life but being done with the hectic nature of London really resonated with me.
Switching people's lights on, against their wishes, seems a bit environmentally unfriendly.
Grandmas precious words were just as special as any spectacular shot!! I enjoy every single vlog!!! Even if it's just the two of you in the car talking 😘
honestly the editing on these vlogs is just so beautiful ❤❤
I loved grandmas vlog gong and I loved this vlog xx
I've only recently started watching, a few months or so, but your videos are truly inspiring and hilarious. I absolutely adore the style, the effort put in is evident. Keep it up!
I love how every week I have a new movie from the michalaks to look forward to
Bath is my dream city to live! If you move there I cant wait to see more of that lovely city!
My husband and I are moving too. The seller also said he had two other people looking at the place we want.
Friends of ours lent us their discovery for our wedding & after 2 weeks of driving it, i was so depressed that we had to give it back, now all I want is a discovery 😩 life just isn't the same anymore 😂
at 10:52 when the little caption pops up, don't know why that made me laugh so much 😂 amazing vlog as always Stef & Hannah!!
Buy plug in electric radiators!!
the quality of your vlogs are bloody amazing
Pleaseee a house tour before moving xxx
Another brilliant video! Makes the everyday life look so much better xx
The unlicensed gynecologist version of Jeremy Clarkson 😂😂😂
Have you tried looking up a man with a van instead of a removal company? They seem to take the piss!
Just got home to Norway after being in London for bank holiday weekend, it was lovely!  Loved this weeks vlog and I really hope you'll get your dream house xx
Another great video this week as always!  Good luck with the house, hope you guys get it :)
I love seeing the relationship between Grayson and his grandma. Unfortunately I lost both my grandmothers when I was younger, but it's so lovely to see how much she loves him. It really makes me miss having those times!
Have you tried man with van, they all give you different quotes trying to beat the price. Sure thats what its called, hope you get it xx
I feel so invested in your bid for this property! I feel like, in a way, I'll be moving in there with you guys. Really hope you guys get it! xxx
I was really hoping the ending would be Kirsty and Phil on the phone saying the vendor has accepted your offer!! Such a huge change but I am so excited for your new chapter, and also can't wait to visit!! xx
Another beautiful video guys. The only YouTubers my other half will sit and watch with me... The Grandparent chat made me well up - captured something so very special. Keep it up! X
I'm only 3 minutes in and I love this blog already! I LOVE your style of blogging! This is my favourite video I watch every week! Keep it up stef❤️❤️
I really enjoy your vlogs :3 they calm me down soo much. Once I would love to have a family like yours. Grandma is lovely too :3 she should definitely vlog more 💕
I always get a rush of emotions sweep over me when I start seeing your weekly video :-) Thank you for your hard work as always
I totally understand what you mean about London.
I actually love this little family! They are such an inspiration!
new to you guys! <3 love it
All I can think of is the magic in your family <3 What a beautiful energy :)
every videos are just like a movie.. so impressive and lovely moment
Did you guys ever consider Cambridge for moving?
Ugh Steph you make me feel things with your films. Thank you
wow grayson grown up so much!
Your Mum is so lovely!!! So true to herself, what a good Grandma:)
I don't quite know how watching the lives of a family half a world away from me can be so soothing to the soul, but it truly is.
The grannie rocks!
Rent your own van and save money
Beautiful video this week. I look forward to them every Sunday ❤️ it had me in stitches and also close to tears with stef's mum as she's so lovely! And oh doesn't Grayson love his grandma 😍just beautiful thank you x
Ireally hope you get this house or an equally great house, I see you very happy there in Bath and it will be the right move for your beautiful family.
Such a nice vlog this week. I really liked your conservations and so far it is one of my favorite videos.
"At least they didn't have to fly United!" Lol. "And the Jews, these guys PASS.....OVER!" LOLOLOLOL
Mellisa Mcarthy is funny. But she needs to change it around. Sean Spicer was angry at the beginning but now he's a nervous reck. She's so funny but will need to be different
Not funny at all.  I would love to see Sean Spicer walk out on these bozos one of these days........
She's an awesome actress.  She has created one of the most memorable characters on SNL.
Want some of that beautiful chocolate cake
Spicy must've been sweating like hell in that bunny suit
concentration clubs
Everyone always forgets the evil King Leopold.
Melissa is the only good thing about SNL
Jews left black an came back white  r.i.p Hitler
its like kate mckinnon its so funny because shes owning it xD
When SNL make fun of Trumps presidency and the ratings have gone to shit
Last Easter on earth... I caught that, Spicy.....
"But I thought Trump was ?" What telling a type of other truth
This is just more hatred and vitriol from left who are alla bunch of  anti American marxist pigs who want to live under the rule of Soros and the NWO.
I would totally let Jenna drive me around in a golf cart. But not sober.
still waiting on somebody to point out one of her funniest movies same plan comedy bullshit horrible comedian i ever seen.even the guy who smashed fruit was funny
At 3:31 mark, Babar Al-Ashad....ROFL!
2:00 killing it!
Omg I love this last few months xx
These are only funny if you watch a Sean Spicer Press conference
" ... if the nit pickers see the big picture and solely didn't focus on every little slur and lie I say, that would be nice."   LOL  I'm done.  I love her.
She is hilarious!! OMG! This is the funniest sketch ever! lol
Melissa McCarthy knows how to play Sean Spicer better than he does himself. 😂
You americans are so cringe, I hate you all
Shame on Jew
she's a horrible lesbian wanna be.
Totally improvised I hear..
Eat as much candy as you want because it's probably the last Easter on Earth!
not even funny....must have lost their writers.
kudos to the make-up artist who transformed beautiful Melissa to,  of all people,  middle-aged dumpy Spicer.  They even opaqued her sparkling blue eyes into his puffy eye-look.
Finally! A heartfelt apology! I don't know what everyone's complaining about. Spicer seems pretty professional! Oh, and not at all an idiot!
damn that bitch is ugly as fuck
more please!
Sad that so many would rather listen to lie
HAHAHA....Thank you Melissa McCarthy....You are truly amazing!!!
Melissa McCarthy is God.
Amazing how these sorts of actor are just choosing SNL as their new careers. Pretty pathetic.
Melissa McCarthy is a fat ass unfunny cunt who should take a drug overdose and help save the planet by dying. No one should be exposed to her fat blubber smell.
and the Jews PASSOVER 2:58
Melissa is hilarious, she does Spicer really good 😃😉😋😆
Meliisa McCarthy playing Sean Spicer is even funnier than Alec Baldwin doing Trump, and I didn't think Baldwin's impersonation could be topped. SNL Rocks!
This was incredible.
New vids, when?? I need my shot lol.
She did a great Job.  I love this lol.
I hate the left . . . but this is gold. Poor Spicer, lol.
silly, just too stupid for my likeing! lmfao.
they are giving away t-shirts on AgaShirt ( . ) com site
Another week another Hitler debate.
Spicer in fact wore a easter bunny custom for the bush administration. 😂😂😂
Aka Jewish easter
jews pay my bills wage slave.

LOL, I did fly united for the Easter break. For once, they were very courteous. I got an extra  free drink 😊
no one cares about these. stop making this trending
Someone please tell me hen to laugh .
Not sure what's harder to watch.  SNL or hearing the audience trying so hard to make the show work.
Bunny paws funny.
Has anyone else found the joke yet? Cause i haven't laughed at anything she has done
The absurd anger of this administration
I always look forward to those blue boxes during her performances 😂
$10 bucks says she's got testicles. Expect nothing less from a liberal freak!
The biggest joke in the history of our country Trump and his band of Russian traitors.
I love "Jewish Easter".  Brilliant.
REALLY NICELY::))THANKS!
this show sucks
She is so awesome, absolutely one of my favorites
I can watch this all day long she is on it love her 😂😂😂
So many levels of wrong lol this is great
boring......
Anything is funny as long as its against the power in control
Melissa does deserve the best OSCAR rewards !  she's too funny
I can't stop watching...this is the most hilarious skit I've seen...ever
2:52:  "...I not going there again.  Fool me once, shame on me.  Fool me twice, shame on  Jews...."      lol
left wing trash....remember when we were Americans and didn't bash our President and his administration.....people are soft and always offended which leads to them being haters.
LMAO "concentration clubs"
"Even Hitler never used chemical weapons" yeah he never dropped nukes either

hey Laura DIY what did you use to edit
what is your po box
I subscribed i love you 😘
They blew up the OKC federal building. Leah Busby was their point person.
The SPLC is just a radical ant-American organization that targets and slanders innocent political groups and private citizens.
The SPLC is an alt-left terrorist organization, and should be treated accordingly. They are homegrown terrorists.
Get rid of the ADL and AIPAC while you're at it. Jewish filth.
These scum should have lost their tax status long ago.
SPLC can F off.
That argument is flawed as SPLC could easily also be Green or Libertarian.
Liberal POS.
Non profit tax status should be abolished and replaced ENTIRELY just like OBUMMERCARE
But they list the BEST news sources.  I've heard liberty minded talk show hosts begging Potok to put them on the list!
I'd love to see that it's nothing but a group of socialist lawyers
Everyone should be tax exempt. All it takes is cutting government back to its constitutional limits.
Southern Poverty Law Center is a hate group.
The Clinton Foundation along iwth the many foundations Soros manages need to also lose its charity status- theyre using it to avoid caps on donations and paying taxes on those funds
I agree with this idea ,this would sweetly castrate the SPLC
Take them to court for hate speech.
All these issues are like weeds every time you pull one out another reappears!
I'd consider it a badge of Honor to be put on SPLC list as a hate group.
the NFL should be next on that list. non-profit my ass.
Forget non-profit status, they should lose their legal status.
The SPLC is an anti-American, communist front.  It is a political arm of the DNC.
For one political party? Wouldn't it be more accurate to say for one ethnic group?
STOP MONIES$ FROM GOING TO THESE PEOPLEASAP!!!
trump should cut out all bull shit programs
https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/802555786245197826
... liberals are seething with hypocrisy.
SPLC... such a poooor gang of lawyers...
Yes,  the lot of non- profits disobeying God's perfect justice should lose their tax-exempt status, in my opinion.
you betcha ! along with cutting out all government waste, this would also be a prime market... liberal "pacs" undermining democracy. notify ACLJ.org and IRS
Agreed, the S.P.L.C. Tax Exemption Status needs to be pulled.
But that might mean they will have to pay taxes and self fund without government tax payer dollars, how could this be fair? MAGA
I know that wasn't the topic just bringing it up and tax any other religion that sticks their nose in politics
It goes for all hate group that burn an loot .
Planned parenthood should lose theirs also
Make The Church of Scientology pay taxes and shut them down as a cult. Please, they are destroying families
Taxpayer dollars being used verse taxpayer dollars.  Over and over again, cross so many spectrums.  Multiple big loops, used to create jobs and justify spending with endless excessive taxation?
hmmm is it another gearge soros group???
They are waaaaay too political to be a "charity"
Silly Pathetic  Liberal  Clowns. ..
Don't expect anything good coming out of the IRS.  Our own modern day Gestapo.
He'll yeah! Take it away.
I think I have hypertension after all the salt the liberals have been freely giving us this month. I just can't stop consuming. Their tears are delicious 😜
How did they swing tax exempt status in the first place? Obama's administration sucks!
Garry, you are labeled, then so am I! Am Government& for Law Enforcement!
shut them down no more free tax money they should pay it back
SPLC is a hate group.  No tax breaks for hate groups.
a lot of the things that they do to conservative groups and individuals should be labeled as hate crimes.
any company that receives any government funding such as this one and planned parenthood should loose all government funding if they show any biased of any type aside from promoting the law as it is written.
They should have never had it in the first place
Screw them all. Let God sort them out!!!
They should have lost it years ago.

Windows S is forfeitable for Windows 10 Pro, just saying.. But, no USB C/TB3? F right off m8
PewDiePie in the green on the right at :12
reminder that windows 10 S forces you to use edge and bing
Looks like a mac
Overpriced... $999 and not even 8GB of ram? is this a joke?
tell me one good reason why I should pay $1000 for something with such low performance and disappointing features. I could pay $100 less for a GAMING LAPTOP.
my phone has more ram/rom
Microsoft is the new Apple (1000 bucks 4 GB ram whoa!!)
No one has been waiting for this, it is overpriced and sucks, locked down maybe even worse than apple machines
Is Microsoft going the Apple route with this overpriced, under-powered hardware?
WTF? 4gb ram and i5 for the base model? FOR 1000$?!?! I can build a WAY better pc that can run full Windows 10 and not the crappy W10 S for half the price!!
can only run apps from windows store thats so cool! except that it isnt
Anyone know what wallpaper is it on the laptop?
only problem i have with this is that it uses a GPU with the same specs as something you would see like 10 years ago. other than that i think the device is amazing just by looking at it.
So strange backgroundmusic :D
guys im a big fan of the surface series, im typing this from my surface pro 4, but honestly microsoft could have done better with such a cool design and concept like that :/ at least bump up the ram for a start
omg that is so expensive for a laptop with only 4gb of ram an i5 and 128gb ssd...
WTF is windows S? Microsoft keeps bringing these barebone OS out and they'll all fail like Windows Mobile, people just want the real deal, the complete package.
If money isn't an issue for you, why would you bother with a windows device over Mac? And don't say touchscreen…
Where's the Surface Pro 5??? I want it.
If you don't want the Windows 10 S Operating system you just full-reset the laptop and boot with the windows 10 home os, There are many videos with real working keys
I hope somebody reviews it with Windows 10 Pro (8gb RAM, i7) then we'll know the performance.
"Windows S"xuse me but I'm not buying crippled watered down junk from the crapyard.
speakers under the keyboard they are copying the chromebook pixel.
here we go... Microsoft trying to shove that awful store down our throats
Did I heard correctly only a 120GB SSD?????!!!
Hit man keep spying from the back
This is meant to compete the cheap Chromebooks with the price of min $999? And with such a poor app catalogue as the Windows Store? Nice strategy, Microsoft...
Only can run windows apps? whats the point then? what a waste of 900 dollars, worse than an apple product.
It comes with Windows 10 S but you can upgrade to Pro for free. I guess their just trying to push 10 S.
windows 10 s, the reason this laptop wont sell.
big let down with windows store only apps and no 360 tablet mode for $999. ms fan but disappointed. like the design thou
Is this better than the dell xps 13?
Base model too expensive for what it is. Windows 10 S?, really? You can buy a higher spec laptop for less and run full Windows 10 desktop.
stupid laptop . what if drops of water fall on its fabric . its so unrealistic to swipe across a large screen .
Closed the video as soon as I found out what Windows S is
Terrible. At this price point not even a CD disk drive...
Clearly it's only Microsoft that is truly innovating nowadays.... Love it! It's like Apple and Microsoft got their inner souls / spirits switched. 😊 Honestly I'd rather _both_ were innovating....
Was excited until I heard it runs Windows 10 S. Don't know what it is but already know it ain't worth that price tag
Why would someone buy it ?
Windows Store locked OS... that's just pathetic
Who else likes windows 7 better than windows 10
Can you change windows to normal 10 ?
I'd get a casual desktop for $300 or less and a ps4 or a gaming desktop instead of this apple like laptop.
If it does not support the "three-finger window drag" gesture, not interested.
where is the speaker?
Basically a $1,000 Chromebook, what a joke
$999 and they said this laptop for student for School. Hahahahaha Microsoft is a joke
They have a headphone jack! 1:27
Looks like a Macbook... what a scam.
But...but...but why? when you can get a gtx 1050 ti i7 processor 16gigs of ram and solid build for less...
Far better laptops in price range with gpus.. sure they dont look as hip i guess, but still its expensive and nothing special.
I wonder how hot this thing runs
Stopped watching when he said "no USB-C". Don't understand why any company would make a device without one at this point. It's a standard and it works great.
3:48  "i Fink"?
only runs apps from windows store???? F that! whose gonna buy a 1000$ USD laptop that only runs windows store apps?   BAAAAD business plan!
eww i don't like the fabric... stains are really annoying to deal with. I think the surface book is better
THAT is the laptop you were waiting for?
You should have made an initiative to actually have apps in the App Store first. Marketing to students and you don't even have the blackboard app
Cool. Oh wait, only windows store apps. Awful.
at 999, it better be able to run Gears.
yet another low voltage processor
Can I install Windows 7 on it?
A macbook wannabe
windows 8 rt is back...
THE WINDOWS LAPTOP WE ALL BEING LOOKING FOR?????????? WITH NO USB-C?????? OHHHHH MY GOD - have people really lost their minds.
Amazing laptop, Microsoft have they given up with smartphones already then?
$1k for 10 S instead of a usual operating system with full functionality?
4gb of RAM, an i5, and integrated graphics for $999? no way
wow I pay 1k$ for that spec? and for a lower version of Windows? everything have to go through app store, and the browser is Edge, which you can't change! Wonder how much more needed to UPGRADE to actual Windows 10.
real sense camera but then just ONE usb 3.0 port and 4 gb RAM?? Come on Microsoft its 2017!
Why would you want a USB C port?
Regular USB?  Thumbs up MS.
$999 for a laptop that only runs Windows apps?  Byeee...!
ITT: retards whining about specs  Business as usual
I hope this flops so Microsoft wakes up.. forcing windows store only apps.. ugh.  disgusting
hasnt cut corners on the inside.. 4gig ram.. 128ssd i5 underpowered processor... are we still in 2005?
Kill it! Destroy it with fire!!! bring your katanas and slice the price tag in half!
Would have been great with 10.and if had 360 screen
naah you are paying 500$ for the carpet.
Lol looks nearly like first Macbook Air that was release in late 2008 :D
yes gal!!! drop to more like this 😅

DWL #EQUALRIGHTS
What a blessing. Thank you so much! I knew you would be back again with so much to offer still to the American people. You and Michelle are forever our first family!
I wish Obama was Prime Minster
You will forever be my President. So inspiring!
oh great a place for all ur fans to worship u at Mr . Obama.... just what Chicago needs .... another place of worship... LMAO...
Please come back NOW
I'm only subscribed here to see what Obama puts out there.  You all are really fooled that he did great things.  President Trump has done more than he did in 8 years!!!!
Save us Obama-Wan Kenobi! You're our only hope!
Oh my lord, how could anyone hate Obama when he shows how much he cares for people
Thank you my President and my First Lady Forever!  Thank you for 8 years as President teaching us never to give up. And thank you for this wonderful Presidential Center.  Bless you both.
Much like the Bernie, Trump or Bush videos, there seem to be a lot of sheep commenting. The leaders have done a wonderful job selling the propaganda to the idiots.
I hope he incorporates his advocacy for science into the library!
President and First Lady Obama, I am so proud to have called you that! I miss your leadership, strength and kindness. I hope that you are enjoying life as civilians once again. 💗
Well, THANKS OBAMA ! :D
Thanks, Obama.
I love you Obama!
Very nice design. Who's the architect?
GO OBAMA!!!!!!
thanks obama!
I am so proud of President Obama and Mrs Obama . Now.. and always. This is My President... now.. and always
You Two & THIS are soo needed right now!  Kind of been a shit show for the last few months....
you're the man, Mr. Obama. I miss you )-:
Personally I love Obama, without him we wouldn't have Trump😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
Nice!! Now come win an election in Canada! ;)
Remember a few days ago when everyone was mad because Obama took some money for a speech he gave to a health insurance company?   Yeah. Not hearing much out of those people today.
Here before hatestorm comes
Whoop whooop!!
When you know you'll love the Obamas forever!!
Where will the Trump library be? Trump Tower?
Was that windmills I saw in the design.
listen..... I love Obama too.... but give the man a BREAK! EIGHT YEARS OF DEALING WITH BULL and he finally has the time to be a attentive father / husband... let the man have some time to breathe...
We all miss you and love you
I'm there already!  #StillMyPresident
2021, please hurry up! I can't wait to visit the Obama Presidential Center. You guys are my #ForeverPOTUS #ForeverFLOTUS
ever cry at the sound of someone's voice?
You are my hero.Your family is a perfect role model! You did great!
My longest yeah boy ever
this is the moment we chew soap
Yo ima need to get the color back in the logo Barry, I dont need it to look as sad and grey as I am
Thank you for making us proud.
I'm not a hug fan of the architecture. It reminds me of a literal egg.
Awesome initiative.  Will flourish just like your two term in office. Bravo!!!!
I don't care if your Democratic like me, or even if your Republican, we can all admit one thing: Obama is best anime.
good that you are still going to help people
Thanks, Obama.
Thank you President Obama. We need you and your message now more than ever.
dad come back please
Come back Obama!! We need you!
i can't wait for it to be built omg thank you president obama!
S.O.S!!!!!!!
man oh man once its done i have to see it even if it means flying half around the world for it
even after being President, hes still trying to help thr people. nice.
Wow, how blessed can one be to be able to help so many from generation to generation! No one can repeal and replace this legacy!!!  #respect #love #growth #knowledge
I should visit Chicago
yes please help the inner city youth.  they feel lost and abandoned
and they chose a orange buffon who still shouts for his victory on Twitter over the continuation of this legend. love you obama....our love is greater and is not fake like the love of trump supporters for trump.
It looks like the Hall of Justice
wheres the Patreon
What a hero
Yes we can! Because we have hope!!!!
Wow!!! I can't wait to visit! Hey, maybe someday I'll work in some capacity with the facility.
im from germany n im syrian
When the previous president does more for the country than the current one.
I can't wait to see what's to come of this! I'm behind you president Obama! Love you guys!
Thanks Obama
Imma pretend that you're still my president.
The building looks nice.
I miss having a competent president.
Good job Obama!
Nice job Obama!

MERICA!!!!!
"Real freedom means respecting others' freedom as much as you value your own" I wish everyone in the world could hear this
We're not racist, unless you're an ass and open about it. It's al on the news
Can't wait for part 2...
can you teach me how to korean?
This has been so eye-opening for me. Thank you for the interviews!
These people are so nice and relatable... crazy to think how much they have suffered :(
I've got this strange feeling I look just like the Americans in all their propaganda...
North Korea is like that ex-girlfriend who continues to ruin your life even after you have broken up.
Thank you for filming this and sharing it. Really chilling stuff here. It's sad when any group is given free reign to teach hatred of another group.
dam so there was a lot of truth in the movie the interview
Amazing insight on the subject from all the people that were interviewed! Thank you for making these videos and sharing their thoughts with us!
where is part 2?  i must be blind
out of the topic question.. how can i differentiate between Japanese ,Korean, Chinese by look? my korean knowledge is only from the descendants of the sun
Would love for the interviews to be translated into spoken English so I can just listen without having to watch.
As a U.S. Veteran; I was curious what their perspective of the American Military?
great video!! i really enjoyed listening to all their perspectives, i cannot wait to watch the next part. :)
arent we all brainwashed though?
this is why i subscribed. the quality content and the interviews and perspective they have for us is astonishing.
Amazing interview and amazing people.
This should be on the news, I don't think many people understand how North Korea sees themselves and the rest of the world
well, there isn't a single country in the world that hasn't committed some type of bloodshed
I could listen to Pil-Ju talk the whole day. Really like how he speaks.
Well North Koreans like Die Hard, that's like as American of a movie as you can get, winning over the people there shouldn't be all that bad, their leaders on the other hand...
our news is becoming like theirs just a bunch of propaganda pushing an agenda
North Korea is not a threat to any country.  North Korea has not attacked or invaded another country in 65 years.
I really want to share this, but before I do, do you think these gentlemen coming forward would be in danger, or their families could be put in danger of videos like this were exposed more?
all the Kim's are crazy
"big nose" lmao
why dont you  put parts 1 & 2  together??cant find part two
If you are interviewing NK people, there is no way that NK people will tell you the true. Period! The ultimate point is that, they have to keep themselves alive.
North Korean girls are hot! And the few North Korean girls who fled all married White guys. So they love us, too 💕
As an American, for certain i can say we do not think negatively of the people of North Korea. We only hate the leader of North Korea because of the unfair treatment of its people. I hope a revolution happens soon.
Big butt havin, wide nose! Sucking up all of the white man's air!
So those are actual North Koreans? How did you talk to them? Did you stay in the country and get caught, or did you leave the country and get caught?
That douche has the whole nation brainwashed...
can you go and film in north korea just like the basketball players did?
I think the documentary propaganda campaign provides a good viewpoint too.
thank you. i really enjoyed this. quite informative
...Oh yah, Donald Trump.  Good job, Asian Boss.
"smash the American bastards..." lol
At 2:00 I found out N. Koreans teach kindergartners how to run as fast as they can with a knife
scary eyes? look in the mirror my ninja
The scariest part is that these people are from North Korea who are known to be violent people yet when they hear stories about America's Mass shootings, they see America as a violent place too.
Yankee go home!!
Yankee go home!!
If one more of these ass holes says I have a huge nose I'm gonna beat them to death with my big American dick! my nose is average, you insensitive fucks.
very very very insightful. thanks
Don't bother about dem haters!! Love all these insights that we can't see elsewhere, keep up the good work guys!!
how do you get a usa t shirt in north korea?
hhahahah North Korea named the Jew nose
Hello!  Me and my fiancé just began a vlog page.  We would love for you to come check us out!!!
I'm for freeing North Korea.  It's time to take their oppressive regime out.  Let's take out a government that deserves it for once!
all north Korean guys look feminine
Im laughing thinking about the North Korean government watching this and getting mad like " bitcccchhhhhhhhhhhhh".
Some of the people writing these comments are more brainwashed than the N. Koreans. And not nearly as smart. About half of you assholes wouldn't even be alive today if it wasn't for America.
jesus..they are completely brainwashed. it reminds me of the kids they recruit for isis. is there really much of a difference?
bye im going to north korea 😂😂 they are soo freacking handsome and cute😛💕
America could win a war against north korea just by using drone lol..
It is the governments that have problems with each other not the common people who rebuke the brainwashing.
People want to complain and protest Trump should be glad they have the freedom to do so. Just think how things are in North Korea and they would realise how much freedom they have here in America.
Now thats pure hate
6:00 " South Korea has been colonized by America and are the poor brothers we couldn't unite with who are living in extreme poverty." Shocking.
watch at 1.5x speed. It's still slow enough to understand even if you're listening to the korean.
I'm happe that I'm not Born in the US otherwise i would be Brainwashed too
Iam happy not to Born in us
OMG, the poor north Koreans being lied to so badly... OOOH what a shame. Effects of being completely brain washed
start to love this channel! love steve and kei too hehe
It shouldn't matter what these people think of us. Cause, I'm definitely not going to lose sleep over.
Lying and manipulating - Sounds like typical politics, just pick your bullshit. Disgrace against humanity.
Omg this reminds m of the stories told by my parents about Ussr it's just the same! Wow
Let's send feminists there so they can experience real patriarchy and oppression
Great Reporting! Thank You!
I love these so much. Fascinating.
grats for being on 9news.com.au
Some historical background why NK hates USA: https://theintercept.com/2017/05/03/why-do-north-koreans-hate-us-one-reason-they-remember-the-korean-war/
damn.. that massacre sounds so gross!!
This needs to be aired on commercial TV around the world, no joke.
Wow...these interviews are truly interesting and fascinating, I can't get enough of it

BHAI KATTI JABARDAST VIDEO HAI ........BIG FAN ...
Proud of such girls.. They are very well suited for the upcoming Information Security & Financial Services boom
First good interview in months
One of the 🐐's, Pryor,B-Mac,Eddie,ChrisR.,DaveC like if agree
Angela Yee sucks so bad. She can't improv at all. She sounds so out place.
he ain't lying about asap rocky!  truly underrated and skilled as hell at spitting.
now its time yall get eddie and dave chappell!!!!
Charlemagne, stop tryna throw shade at Envy's questions all the time.
This one is really a good one CR always brings the real!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Niggas confuse Jay-Z's business success with his musical prowess.
everybody hates Chris and the Bernie Mac show are hands down the best comedy sitcoms published
DJ Envy....Why?!  Just why?!
He's so humble.  I love it.  Can't wait to see him in a few weeks!
3:25 dj envy the type of dj to play  Biggie juicy intro and still call the police on his ppl when they tryna feed they daughters (family)
he still looks like a crack head.
CHRIS NEED MORE SLEEP
I am still mad at the ending of everybody hates chris series finale I still don't understand it lol
We need that Pooty Tang sequel!  Pooty Tang vs the President... 👍🏾
Envy tried to TOTALLY change his own version of the events. He was wrong and he knows it.
Charlie Murphy had a small role as a bouncer in Mo Betta' Blues before CB4.
Y'all trippin if you ain't hear this yet https://soundcloud.com/vonny1/someone-i-could-trust
Chris Rock look good asf he is aging very well.😊
I will forever be in the mood to watch head of state forever
Boomerang is a classic film I could still watch it today !!!
Chris still has it!!!
Yee needs to learn when to shut up
explain to the ppl whats the phone clause #Envy at it again
we need a remake of everybody hates chris.. a netflix series.. something of that nature
Get me all the red sneakers!! LOL
who is Chris rock competing against? the internet. i think the internet generation don't care as much of Chris and. saying this as a fan at 22
I strongly dislike Envy. Bruh is a bird brain, frfr
Damn. is K. Dot's 4th studio album not 3rd.
Envy is a dumb piece of shit... Damn.
Damn, we think rap is in a bad state compared to the last twenty years, think of stand up comedy. What new stand up comic can go toe to toe with guys like Chris?
Hot 97 interview are so Corny, it's like their trying too hard
Envy was duckin my boy chrissy the black
I love Jay Z music, but he was never my top five
Chris Rock is a legend
You busy right now you doing book shows right now 😂😂😂
fake laughter
Angela, please stop asking questions irrelevant to the great joke the comedian previously tells!    Sincerely, Viewers Management
chris know his stuff respect
I think i love my wife was a classsix
yoo what he said about the migos album is 100 percent true great album
Chris Rock played Rick Ross in a movie.
This is really a fantastic interview! Mannnnn I wanna see the show in  Brooklyn! ❤️❤️
I love Chris Rock. Bernie Mac and him are my fav! <3
Chris rock got that funny ass smile😂😭😭
I love Chris Rock but what's wrong with his hand?
Marty the Zebra from Madagascar!
Wow smh envy nails are so clean and long, thought they were fake
infiltrated by Envy 😂
" good ideas are better than ideologies; no body ever got martyred over a 'gd idea' "  Apostle Rufus
I smoked crack in the Carter! 😂😂😂
Kevin Hart corny and wore a dress.......smmfh
Stop worshipping Jay Z!!!! You gonna sit here and say Jay Z is better than NAS???
I'm trying to watch this new show staring CTG with Chris Rock as Executive Producer.
But y is constantly hiding his left hand...he brought it up early in the show and it seemed like it was disfigured a lil bit....hmmmmmm?
As many Comedy  shows THAT  NETFLIX HAS PUT ON I THINK IS  A DIRECT  ATTACK ON  KEVIN HARTS IDEO FOR AN ALL COMEDY  NETWORK
This guy career is CRAZY successful, Im too ready for the Netflix special. Salute to one of the Kings of REAL comedy.
Good interview. Chris Rock always funny af.
Love me some Chris Rock!
Nah, Chappelle is on another level.
No fake laughs with Chris Rock. LMAO every time!!!
Annoys me when these type of interviews are 40 mins! Constantly checking the clock like don't end yet!lol
everybody hates Chris was one of my favorite shows, I need to get Netflix
I'm with Charlemagne, I don't find Amy Schumer funny, never have
chris geekn that Ali Wong is phony as shxt !!
chris needs to get a big ass gold rolls Royce so the police get the message
I think Chris Rock is very handsome for a 52 years old man.
is it shocking that The Breakfast Club hasn't broke up yet?
I wanna see Adam Sandler on the breakfast club that would be dope
evvvery boddyyy haaaaeeetes chrisssssss
DJ Envy asks the same thing all the time "are there any artist you regret not signing? " , "Is there any role you regret passing up ?" It's like the only question he ever asks 🤣
Envy looked mad salty doing the intro, like he wished he was in Africa again
"nerds have dicks too, nerds want the same thing too..they're just nicer about it" lol
whys dj envy sound like he's talking into a pillow
Jamie Foxx got a classic standup lol he slept on ft fr
Chris Rock is naturally funny. I agree with him on J Cole tho. I definitely think he number 1 right now.
Dave chappelle & Patrice o'neal(rip) & Chris rock are infinitely funnier than Kevin hart...but I respect that niggas hustle and work ethic
Chris rock is too funny my favorite comedian
Would love to know where Envy got that sweater from ...
Chris Rock the goat
I went to the show it was dope. Never scared was my favorite though.
kids wearing red sneakers no matter what and don match  nothing. hahaha that got me
Damn, Envy every five mins was trying to end the interview. Let it breathe, the moments come then edit the dry spaces after its over. Especially with Legends.
Wrong! Charlie Murphy was in Harlem Nights he was one of the Bar Tenders.
''You busy now, you're doing book tours'' looooool chris rock is too much
MELMAN THE ZEBRA KEEPS POPPING IN MY HEAD WHENEVER I SWITCH TABS, DAMMIT
Rock is a living legend! And mad humble.
Chris just genuinely happy and funny ... he smiles and laughs the whole interview even being serious ..
I strongly dislike this N*&$! DJ Envy, 'DJ Envy" the irony
CANCEL THIS SHOW NOW!!!!
i luv your channel cause i get to watch teen titans go and i luv it
teen titans go is so funny! it's my favorite cartoon network show! why does it get so much hate? if it cancels, idk what i'll do but i'll be sad :(
Free bleach!
Yeah...I think this silly villain from the original show actually fits in with TTG...
So many haters, TTG FTW!
Wow. This show had some rough episodes but wow. An exact, shorter, less detailed copy of the episode from the original. I was thinking it would turn out different at least. Lol wow.
TTG became popular because a lot of kids, probably ages 4-11, really enjoy watching it.  I doubt more negative comments are going to change anything.
cancel this show NOW
cancel this show
How u get a job? just askin?
It's actually good😊
Employee Of The Month= V8 rear wheel drive classic muscle car. employee of the month redux= I4 front wheel drive ricer car. Need I say more.
GLAD I SUBSCRIBED
1:10 - hotdiggedydemon is a workor for No-Fu? That suprises me.
A live action Version of teen titans Go would be awesome
This is why Cartoon Network is dead
im having some serious dajavu right now
This Show would't called TTGH because T - orture T - he G - odamn H - aters
Welp hello peta this is gonna be ugly...
plz cartoon Network Tix ur self and ur horrible mb deathen tv shows
Stop it cn!
this show is almost giving me cancer. cancel this show
teen titans GO         cancel this show
For those of you who didn't watch the original show the tofu was a real villain FYI
Why won't they just stop 😭?!
stealing work from an old show gets no respect from many fans
very bad episode. this isn't a new episode, its a stolen episode from the original.
OG Teen Titans did this better.  You may as well do Season 6 now and ruin it too.
Omg the computer guy from lab rats omg
This show is killing Cartoon Network
CP9 is hunting beast boy
To anyone watching this video, this episode is a direct rip-off of a episode from the Original Series called Employee of The Month.
I mean #killoffteentitansgo
#kill of Teen Titans GO
will everyone shut up about this show this is what they want. they want you guys to hate it because the more hate they get the stronger they are
what's the episode called?
they even took the lines from the episode too, oh god, and I thought these guys couldn't get any lazier.
33 + 33 = 66
As a wise man once said: LET IT DIE! LET IT DIE! LET IT SHRIVEL UP & DIE!
this is nobody. nobody loves to watch ttg, nobody also likes robin the most, nobody even laughs at the jokes, nobody prefers ttg over tt.
Cartoon Network... Just... STOP! WE DON'T NEED THIS CRAP. JUST STOP SHOWING THIS UGLY SHOW OMG I HATE YOU CARTOON NETWORK! THAT'S IT CARTOON NETWORK. I AM GONNA FIND YOU AND KILL ALL OF YOUR WORKERS.
They're basically just ripping off the original. sad.
why is nofu sound like bendy ?
Ttg is possibly the worst Cartoon Network show.  1. This episode is a ripoff  2. Fart, butt and Tofu jokes are not funny  Come on Cartoon Network, your better than this
I'll dislike every single video of TTG even if it means forever!!
They finally figured out how to further ruin our OG shows.
Yep I'm gonna say... teen Titans Go is a alternate  Universe of Teen Titans, but there's a catch... Teen Titans Go is Flash 😂
Bring back dbz
Now it's run out of ideas so it steals them from the original
whatttttttttttttttttt?
WAIT DID YOU JUST SERIOUSLY RIP OFF TEEN TITANS?!
Cancer, cancel this #BoycottCartoonNetwork #TeenTitansSeason6
WHHHHHY!!!!!!!!!!!!
The cube thing looks like tiny box tim
this is cancerous
Teen Titan Go=Trash  Just little 6 years old like it
That's twice TTG copied the plot of that episode of the 2003 series.
cartoon Network can you please don't show a lot of teen titans go because you are going to lose your fan
when this going canceled?
it's time to stooooop this is...this is not ok...it's time to STOP ITS TIME TO STOP!
The TV guy sounds like Mickey XD
F_U_C_K_Y_O_U _T_E_E_N_T_I_T_A_N_G_O
The language is in Arabic in my TV
Hey this kind of Teen Titans is in my TV but another language
and this just shows how easily butthurt Teen Titans fanboys can get.
Why can't they just bring back the originals than whatever... whatever this is.
End it! Just... FUCK'n END IT ALL!!! Teen Titans No REALLY NEEDS TO Teen Titans Go!!
I got so excited when this show aired cause it was just like the Teen Titans!!
this is a bad show
The more you comment how much u hate it u giving it more views Don't watch this
the evil tofu is back
They're obviously running out of ideas so they're using plots from the original show.
Ugh I used to like this show (and im not talking bout the original teen titans). but its taking over cn! Go see vasikbam's vid (ik wrong spelling 😅)
boo-ya-ka-sha im making fun of cyborg
When I looked at the thumbnail I thought I saw Richard from Gumball.
Do full episodes please
Good episode! I watched it at 5:00 and made it just in time after walking my dog! I got there at 4:57 if I would've come 3 minutes later I would've missed it!
Richard Watterson?  is it you?
im tired of these teen titans go 😒
I remember that episode
I remember that the voice actor of the waiter  in the original TT is the father of powerpuff girls.
Ain't this like the episode of teen titans where beast boy works at a tofu job and they turn out to be evil? I can't really complain cause I don't remember the episode that we'll
Cancel TTG already!
Good job TTG.... turning a good Teen Titans episode. And making it total crap...
The good news is these movies are now available for HOME VIEWING! Check them out for yourself! Mordecai http://amzn.to/2p1ZHG8 Max Steel http://amzn.to/2p24M1c Gigli http://amzn.to/2poKIJ7
To be honest, I liked Mortdecai
You should make a list of the top ten movies that I never saw.
What about Steven Seagal?!? He had numerous contributions to this category!!!😂😂😂
yeah black hat  was bad
who farted?
lol, you can tell I love bad movies. I saw Garbage Pail Kids and It's Pat in theatres.
This is what happens when you have guys who don't listen and/or know the people too well make these movies.
Hm, Swept Away wasn't that bad, and I actually liked the Garbage Pail Kids movie.
I am shocked ghost busters 2016 didnt end up on this list
Am I the only one who thought Mordecai was funny? It made me laugh hard - even though it's not a cinematic masterpiece,  I just want a good laugh from comedies.
I knew gigli was going to be here and fuck you spelling Nazis I don't give a shit that I didn't spell that abomination of a movie
$40 million to make the Delgo shit? Most late-90's CGI was better than that...
There would have been more complaints about Mr. Magoo, but they were on the wrong site when protesting.
Any random animation channel can make better animation than delgo Not to mention better story
Whoa!  Garbage Pale Kids looks like fucking awesome!
I loved the GPK:Movie!!!
Magoo was pulled because blind and seeing impaired protested???  Protested what?  That can't see the fucking movie so how do they know it's showing them in a bad light?  Fucking dumb.
Hardcore Henry was pulled out. That's what Wikipedia says
Just to think in parallel worlds these movies topped the box office.
Watching these really knocks my consciousness down a few levels. I feel like being okay with my government starting a war because they said "terrorist" enough times.
You left off the biggest, Ishtar.
Howard the Duck
Max Steel's review was completely inaccurate. it seems like Watch Mojo isn't even trying to look up facts, just make it up as you go. If they haven't learned from Trump's example, they probably never will.
Only 2.2 million for Max Steel on opening weekend....that's not bad compared to the rest on this list.
Was Mortdecai rly so bad? i thougt it was ok, seen way more floppy films then Mortdecai.
Get Free YouTube Views:   Free
no Dragonball Evolution and no Ghostbusters 2016 !?
The rest never heard of them
Blackhat was so boring
I loved Pat, Lenoard,
I agree with Gigil
I loved the garbage pail kids
No. 4 sucked major Butt
Max Steel was awesome
I loved No. 10  it was great
If they made a Max Steel movie based on the original (not the kiddie reboot) it would have work out good.
I just don't see the problem with Mr. Magoo? why would people bitch about this? didn't they see the movie? I can't believe Watch Mojo left out Jonah Hex! that movie was gone after one week!
oh sweet black baby jesus, tell me there's a bluray release of the garbage pale kids movie or atleast a decent DVD.
Garbage pail kids is Shakespearean.
The cabbage patch kids look like Kim Jong-un and his family
might wanna bleach my eyes after the 3rd one
actually Mordecai wasn't bad at all, and l don't watch that many movies... Depp was great in it.. and so was Paltrow, and that  is saying something.. don't know what they are yapping about...
This turkey should have been on the list.  McCale's Navy (1997) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119640/?ref_=nv_sr_2
some of these I've never even heard of...
I'll say one good about Gigli: Christopher Walken's "pie scene". :)
how about ghost busters, based on the trailer that ended up being a sjeeet too.
Since Cos  was mentioned, I wonder if his Ghost Dad movie was also pulled from theaters? I know that it also sucked, blew, and ate just as much as Leonard Part 6.
5:51.; What did she say?... "You're internet--" what?...
I was expecting NewYork Minute to be on here because that's what it lasted in theater
I've honestly only ever heard of one of these movies Gigli.
I think "bugs" should have been on this list. By far one of the worst movies ever.
I forgot they made a max steel movie.
dark shaows
I actually watched the Garbage Pail Kids movie in the theater! It was Greeat!!!!
come on! I LOVED Mordechai!!!
How the hell did something as shitty looking as Delgo cost 40 million dollars?
Delgo cost 40 million dollars? For some of the cheapest CGI animation I've ever seen? Did the entire budget go to the voice actors?
I loved the Garbage Pail Kids.  I used to watch this movie every day  while growing up..
How about  The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure?
I enjoyed Mortdecai and Blackhat.
How was UHF not on this list? It spent only two weeks in theaters.
i really wanted to see blackhat when it first came out. i was wondering why i couldnt find it anymore after such a short time.
max steel was a great movie
bahahaha Blackhat because the best computer hacker in the world still has to look at the keyboard while he types
blackhat was a good movie
Delgo? What the fuuuuuck?
No mention of, The oogieloves in the big ballon adventure.
Note to self: you CAN teach a dog new tricks...but you can't teach Madonna to act.
I remember collecting Garbage Pail kids cards
It's Pat is camp gold!  Don't mess with my Pat!!
I attempted to watch Garbage Pale Kids on Netflix some years back. It's damn near unwatchable. I liked the cards as a kid but this movie is so bad I couldn't go longer 20 mins.
I actually fall asleep on Blackhat. ^^;
I didn't even know there was a Max steel or mr.magoo movie XD
What the heck is Delgo?
I'm surprised that WatchMojo didn't mention Howard the Duck. That movie bombed with bad ratings especially from those who are fans of the Marvel comic series.
Blind people... complained about a movie...
Gem and the Holograms was actually quite good
Blackhat was a good movie.
The short answer is no. The long answer is nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.
battlefield earth!!  now there is cinema at it's best!
gigli is a good movie not only do you pronounce it wrong i think you judged it wrong
the movie made by James Murray should have been #1
*SPOILER*  Wait but why did Blackhat win (or I guess lose if ya think about it lol)? It made more money than others on this list, and was in theaters longer. Was it because of the star power??
Completely disagree with the assertions about "The Garbage Paul Kids". It's a great movie, funny, goofy, gross, and has an early and positive message for kids about bullying and being yourself.
Fucking blind people man...
ha I thought motdecai was reasonable funny
I hate to say it, but I actually liked Mordicai (?).
meh!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Made a clash of clans hack for you guys. I went deep in the server files to find what truly needed to be modified. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HEJ8SfkxGHFiAdxlkRponY9DKqGktpDCciI9xYOg6W8/pub Enjoy :)
your voice is much annoying than hog riders what the hell!  👉😑
I think it will let u put ur base in different environments idk
CHAR 18299 ig...i think kinda collecting resources.. like that cart do... every 2 days..golds elixr dark elixr ..ig
I think the boat will have a capacity  of troops on there or it might help defending your Base maybe even a second goblin map involved. Can't wait for the update finally something new
When will the update come out?
good. and like comedy sound
what if it's like boom beach
It is the  Bismarck 🖕🏻⚠️
Hmm we can donate elixir and gold with this boat to our clan members
Mysterious Boat !
Clash of Clans is slowly becoming Boom Beach
Major Spoiler... Just like Boom Beach of SuperCell This will be daily resource boat which will give rewards as daily loot bonus like Star bonus with addition Gems
Jack Sparrow has arrived 😂😂
i thnk they might link boom beach and clash of clans together
its going to be connected to the Vikings game, you can sail to fight
Yeah same reaction when I saw that
where it that boat come from?
where it that boat come from?
I think it would make a cool battleship
Bruh, witelightning was talking about your vid, <3 been here since 6k man
The boat might be used to bring more troops when attacking?
wow best actor( whaat! whaat!)
I would like to thank all of you who have seen my comment and subscribe to my channel and comment on your comments😘😘😘
I subscribed!
ahhh... fuck you!!!!
It became like bomb beach goes from boat to other village to attack
boom raid coc
Ooooh shut up !!!
I dont think so the boat is to donate redourse..actually that boat is traveling new islands
what about FLYING dragons and baby dragons
maybe trading stuff or transport loot or reinforcement!!!whooo I'm so excited
It's the same as clan castle maybe free resources from the Supercell system.
the barbarian went under water so it's under water battle or build water village
1.here the answers tht boat use for deliver your army troop donate to you friend .before donate troop just disappear just like that. nothing much 2. could be backup defence your village
ummmm didn't supercell make a game called boom beach is it gonna be like that?
I think you can get another village
What is the boat and what does it represent? Exactly.
this boat is like cc ok..Than it took troops and we can use them in battles like we drop the boat to the water and it go to the village and sent those troops to the attack...😄😄😁
wow. what an asshole
i am getting crazy what would be there
i will be very happy if resources could be donated
i will be very happy if resources could be donated
Work at Home/Online ( $3200 ) eBook Translator Required  ( English -  Malay / Japanese / Chinese / Russian / Spanish / Arabic / Others ) - http://www.linggoworld.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html
Maybe it's a trading boat
09254947124
09254947124
The boat is in your war base too
Last time I came this early my girlfriend broke up with me
I think that the boat does bring resources. A small gold coin or something like that can be seen near the boat. IDK... Lets hope for the best...
Maybe Attack in new  wars but on a beach it
hi, give me gems and elixir by boat my tag is 9UL8PLJC8 and my username is swayam9695214999
It's bring a resources bro
i subscribe i just got on clash of clans in the same thing happened to me
BOOM BEACH IS INVADING LMAOF
use to attack thru the beach maybe
resource islands?
Tell us more bash! Boat Update #2 Video on the way? Let's GO BOISSSSSSS!
maybe the boat lead to a treasures
maybe thier is an new island
its exactly like hayday it will leads to another island
i think they're going to find a portal which leads to Boom Beach. (their future) lol.
nahh its time to visit clash royale's place thats why there is a boat,   kill me
legends say that you can donate gold and elixer to your clan mates with the boat
free gems here #azargetcode
Man I can't believe this. Totally weird!
I was using headphones and when the vedio reached 0:28 I was almost dead! What was that oh god
can anyone say me what is the use of boat
I bet the boat goes to the new island with clash royale troops
I am saying that on clash of clans the boat for when we donate  troops  to others from clan castle the troop was gone in ship and go other village , or when we went to attack other  the troop was comes. on ship
Maybe This Is The One like boom beach gunboat 😂
it would be awesome if they give you gems every time you use it
CAN U TELL CLEARLY WHAT IS THE USE OF IT
I think u can kidnap troops of players lol
Damn clash clans is turning into boom beach
This video really blow up in this channel lmao
The reason I'm watching this is because a boat also appeared on my shore and I was thought that it could take you to other villages that you can attack
Get rid of this video
if all this guys who are doing all this crazy shit just to make money used their brain to do good thing's. the world will be so much better...
Only solution wld be to bring up the price of tungsten to equal the price of gold.
GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO BUY MOLTEN GOLD FROM NOW ON
international ring = the american FEDERAL RESERVE.
Plebs trolling both Jews and the idiots who think gold will be useful for trade if the economy collapses.   Gotta love it. ^^
I would shit my pants if I found Tungsten inside my gold.
put your money in a hole in the ground. thats the only way youll keep it.
all these 'jew' comments, i guess youtube is being swarmed by muslims now too.
everywhere comments like : jews ripping of america  and people say germans are racist......
I hate watching people do that. If you gonna sell, sell it right
So those fancy machines in Dubai that exchange your money for gold bars....hmm
kike got kiked
reminds me of those nasty ass chocolate coins wrapped in gold foil.
it will stay 'Under Investigation' for ever. Because the mint bought the gold bar from the government. it is widely Known the US government does not have any gold left. lol
golds soft, it would not have to be that sophisticated an operation.
Just buy gold shares, you don't need to hold it. The risk is too high
Wow, he really got Jewed on that deal ;)
That's just wrong stop screwing people
i see why my great grandad hates jews
so is Germany's gold being illegally held by the u.s. treasury
donno why all the hate against jews, they look just like other white ppl lol
hahahahahaha.....fkn rich-o's  hahahahahaha
how ironic, Shifty Jews Being Greedy with gold.
Rothwells at its finest...
I'd rather buy fake real estate... with fake water... (neither of which can really  be faked).
Who cares ?
well, most people that own pawn shops usually fuck the needy who are struggling, only god can judge the criminals. still, they should be shot on sight.
there was chocolate on the inside lol
Jews scamming not just the goyim anymore.
Picture yourself in the future, the dollar has failed and you take your gold bar to trade it for food .  15 guys put you against a wall and shoot you for gold .
Picture yourself in the future, the dollar has failed and you take your gold bar to trade it for food .  they saw it open and 15 guys put you against a wall and shoot you for cheating.
Its not built that way by hollowing it out.
am i the only one who doesnt understand the jew comments?
They fuckin stupid for thinkin that shit is real, that shit looked too yellow to begin with.
If it is a hillary clinton type investigation then nothing will happen.
I guaranty you there's a lot of Jews involved....nothing but money Jews not real Jews....
No need to drill a hole, the great Archimedes figure it out. Just put it in water measured the liquid displaced and eureka you now can tell if its real or fake!
meh, as I learned in.economic class, never invest in gold
"the secret service is investigating..blah blah blah. I have no penis." Yah. the same secret service that ships drugs into the country and exports weapons illegally. right. that secret service?
am i supposed to feel bad for crooked that got crooked
JEWlers are thieves themselves. fuck them
LOL, the problem is the cross hanging.  If it were jews they would never have bought it
Alfie Moon racist by any chance??
There is no such thing as a trustworthy Jew. They have taken over America in the background whilst everybody is distracted by "the war on terror".
Jews scamming America
OY VAY,MY SHEKELS!
lolz the jew fuck got fucked
straight finessed
why do you think all those commercials for buying gold are on tv'''scams
Yes, that's what you get for being greedy.
OK, so did the so called "reputable merchant" refund the man's money? If not, then I would say reputable isn't the correct word.
I am no Adolf but when the Asian man talked and I looked at him. I was wondering who spoke.
thats a fatass hole just to see if its real gold lmao
fuck em all ive got no sympathy.the conditions of these mines and the treatment of workers is sickening so fuck em the greedy bastards
can't trust.  Jews
wow scamming the new American way!!  I wonder how long this has been going on for?
If only there were a way to test the interior of the bar without damaging it... Well, there is. A $70 ultrasonic thickness gauge would have exposed this fake instantly.
reputable my ass he is a Jew and he finally got hornswoggled the other million times The Jew hornswoggled the other guy
TIME TO MAKE GOLD PRICE GO DOWN PSYCHOLOGICALLY
naaa dat merchant knew wut he was selling jus acting like he didn't know it was fake it's like a person using a counterfeit 20 getting caught and saying OH MY GOD MY FRIEND GAVE ME IT! u never really know who's at fault
it was probably the Chinese.  dirty fuckers.
I have heard many times as if all fake products comes from China. Well, America too have fake products and fake news. Donald Trump is going to blame China for the fake gold.
I have only started buying 1kilo bars umicore and metalor and I made sure I tested my bars using ultrasonic gauge to put my mind at ease I have my bars up on YouTube nice bars indeed !
It's what happens when you put your faith in "things." "The love of money is the root of all evil."
buy gold from Alaska.
100% from china.
dam thats a gd idea
So its ok, if the rest of the world get fake gold, But the world must stop turning if new york gets some.

indian train: Please NO NO NO NO MUSIC!  NATURAL SOUNDS!
What about the Gelmerbahn with a gradient of 106%.  This is meaningless - gradients are measured in degrees & 90 degrees is vertical.  So what is this part of the film talking about?
Thailand's railway lines are retarded af
gotta add that silly music.
00.30  1 kilo potato. hurry up please
Bangladesh should be written off from the map, disgusting cheap third class bastards. They are very repulsive people. sly and born cheats.
railways for public transportation is ridiculous. I'll drive my car.
India would do that
Maekong railway: Do they have some sign like: "Please do not use toilets when passing the marketplace."?
You fucking moron just tilted a normal picture for the thubnail
No way in heck I would get on some of those. Let alone the last one at 106%. Adult diapers are a must.
May as well have it in your front room
WHere is the Pakistan's Railway?
Facts fuck this music
I enjoyed the video, but I would be very afraid to go on tracks like that.
Very Nice Video Bro!Which Music did You Used?:).
maybe get more carts/wagons so noone need to stand on top, but no that shows lack of common sense
and the thai train with the food dont think ppl can shit/pee on the food while the train drives over the food, thats just normal there so dont buy food there.
Awesome....video....Greetings and like
the Alaska railways like the hary potter movie..wes pokok e ngono lah
brilliant video thx 😎
First class video. Frightening, exhilarating , picturesque. Thanks for sharing
Love to see some of these trains. I've just been in the Pilbara in outback Western Australia and the iron ore trains there are some of the biggest in the world!
why do it appear that every means of transportation in India is dangerous
Fascinating, thank you.
Funny to see all the idiots in the Indian Railways portion, they are all smiling and thinking it's funny to be ridiculously overpopulated and polluted. Lol.
How do the number of deaths falling off a train stack up against the number of car accident victims?
25K per year die in train accidents in India?  It obviously doesn't affect the population!  Population control is long overdue in that country.
really like the Switzerland trolley
wowwww... amazing creature..im scare of that😪😪😪😪
India  women are whores and fuck anything with a penis
Look at all these liberals winging about japs  atrocities, while silent on their forefathers brutalities in the third world. ... Hypocrites. ....
The fuck is 106% incline? Do you mean 106 degrees?
Nice video quality -- but what's the point of that retard music?  Just shut off the sound and enjoy the video.
LOL roof riding... we're definitely going to have to fix that
The Clickbait is on another level!!!
Thanks for the effort but why the shit horrible music?  Someone thinks it contributes something?
1:43 Resident Evil 4 do you remember? ;>
those railways aren t Dangerous. but in Bangladesh they have to attacch more coaches to the train
I will sub to anyone who will sub to me just reply back or like this
India is too damn over populated. That is the problem.
Thank you for not making it a Top 10 from still pictures.
who Indian pay the ticket and who the company control if all costumers get ticket?
Are those guys stupid to set up a market on the train tracks and go through the hassle and danger of it everyday. Don't they have any other space in the entire country?
Horrifically dangerous situations! Who designed that crap? George Bush?
what about snowdon mountain railway.
Clickbait... the video thumbnail was rotated in order to make the train angled which is why I clicked, to begin with...
Can u imagine the smells coming out of Bangladesh?
9:25 that would make a sweet roller coaster and it would get you down in less than a minute from the top.
over seas are dumb asf and cant build to save the fucking life
Hai tran Thanh
25000 death a year that's a good way to reduce Indian population they are billion.
O my god hell no lol
what great video choochooo
do we have to have these ads. Not everyone wants a web site.
Burma railway built by British POWs who were worked to death by Japanese soldiers and officers. A slight difference to the description here. Also, Indians are filthy. 🇬🇧
i think someone needs to cut off some men balls there to many people there
wow man thers no safety in bangladesh and indian rail ways like WTF man jump on when its moving😨
3:10 thats alot of people
Notice all of them are uncivilized 4th world non white countries.
Can you imagine the putrid smell inside an Indian train car packed with stinky indians???  Yuck
I like how you left out the facts out of the Burmese railway...
I wonder how far from the coast you need to get in India to get away from the feces
M U L T I T R A C K  D R I F T  T R A I N

A'town's own.........Great work King
I'm proud of T.I. man.. We GOT to do better
Dat first verse killed every thing....
neva sell your soul 🙏 Jehovah's child ...turn your t.v off and pray
Your a hero
what the hell the van kept going , hope she is OK thank God the road wasn't busy
God Bless that girl hope she's okay ;(
God bless the man and woman who helped the kid I am glad that she survived
Lmao her fault that she opened the door and srsly someone could of grabbed her
We're was the parents ?
I knew it  I wonder if they know the Duggers
Laughed the whole way through
respect to the man for helping the little baby girl as for the one driving the bus should put extra attention on the kids accidents happen we humans hope the little girl is doing good
So did the van come back or....
thats not being heroic its just an ordinary reaction that any human would have
poor little girl 😭
Who & why was the person video taping?
hope church has good insurance  and hope that girl gets a house and learns to stay in seat hopefully with seat belt those buses often have no seat belts.
She was alone at the back of the van and nobody in the van saw her fall?
Didn't anyone (the driver) see her out of her seat? I know they saw that door fling open.
The small children should of been sitting at the front of the bus anyways!  Were there any other adults on that bus? That definitely should have NEVER happened!
God bless the little girl and the hero EMT
How lucky for the little girl that this man was there at the right time!
How the bus just keep driving tho.... someone had to be back there with her.
I feel bad for that Little girl
How?!! And the bus kept goin!! Like wtf
How did the people on that bus not notice a door swing open and a 4 yr old fall out??????? I mean really is it that hard to notice?? Poor girl hope she feels better soon!
how did no one on the bus see her fall out i can see at least one person by the door
I love how the cars on the side  actually stop for once like they actually care
Omg I couldn't even imagine!! This man is being criticized for moving the little girl? Duh... Yea lets leave her in the middle of the road... No one was paying attention on that bus?! It kept going!
great good saving little girl
OMG ARKANSAS I LIVE THERE!!!
I live in arkansas
poor girl😞😢😭😥😓 so glad she is alive😓
I saw this on the Spanish news
Poor babe! I hope she makes a full recovery.
her name is emily rose turner, ruby rose turner, connection?
That was my first thought that bus just kept on going didn't anyone see her fall out????? Thank God she was OK and a paramedic was right behind the bus
Why was a little girl moving around in a bus instead of sitting in a seat with a seatbelt on?
I hope she's ok
Real men right there!
cause she's a dumbass
natural selection lol somebody should've been watch her
you can be a life saveer😘😘😘
the bus kept going?
good job rayen
Im sorry this is bad but i cant stop laughing at this video 😆😱
Oh yeah I saw that on tv
I feel bad for laughing
Funny how ppl want to be mean and disrespectful,but when something like this happens everyone wants to help and be nice
People always find a way to criticize someone for the dumbest thing
That was heart breaking to watch. all I could picture was my daughter. I hope she makes a full recovery!!!!!!!!!!
it's her fault she was obviously playing with the door, but the man was very nice god bless him.
I guess god couldn't handle it
OMG...and the bus just keeps going??  Doesn't see door open or the little one fall out??????  :(
If u pay attention you see someone hands open the door
that poor girl 😢
And the bus just kept on going.... WOW.
What's a church van
The man did something great, yet ppl always find a way to make someone look bad jeez.
Who let that little girl near that door, why wasnt anybody watching her
Good on you !
This is funny!
Where were the parents? Someone call dyfs!!!
not all heros wear capes
HAHAHAHHAHAHA😂😂😂😂
He is a hero. Some people will criticise anyone. Why would he leave her in the middle of a busy highway. That's just common sense
God bless that man the world needs more people like him
God bless that man the world needs more people like him
The bus didn't. Even turn around
Wait.... THEY KEPT DRIVING? How tf could they not realise the emergency door was open? Smh
Leason learned hu kitty! i bet she wont do that again.
good thing the guy was there at the right time. hope she's ok
aww poor little girl,  I'll pray for u that ull recover
No parents or adult to watch the kids? The bus driver wasn't made aware of a fallen child and didn't stop or return?
The Priest Stereo-type rapist is rollin
She probably won't be playing with emergency doors ever again. Glad she's safe though.
Wow....You critisis someone that helped a little girl that fell from a moving bus?
Yo. Why didn't the bus stop. They should've known the back door opened
Why do they always have dashcams?
Until they put locks on these doors, they should consider having an adult in the back of these buses..
engineering trolley problems. how do u design a handle for emergency that doesn't create an emergency?
And the fact the YOU see a man in the back staring at the girl DROPS DOWN AND HITS EVERYWERE IN HER BODY!! And then after the church van left.. ITS A CHURCH VAN!!! JESSE.. THESE PEOPLE
Legend says the church van isn't ever coming back.
poor baby...i hope she ok...thank god she lived
what in the name of spiderman is a law not to move someone who fell of a vehicle..
All I can say…thank goodness America is not China😳!
Religious people: "God saved her! and Satan possessed her to open the door!!!"

notice the irony in the picture of Melania on the wall at 0:07 ... you can find those pics of our lovely first lady on google images, with safe search turned off. Enjoy...
Who is the one next to Donald Trump Picture?
It hurts to laugh.
Make america Simpsons again
Interesting they even gave the Jewish judge a NY accent  There's your anti Semitic right in your dumb faces .. The elite are laughing at you IDIOTS
American politics has always been a cartoon joke
Is it just me or is this along with Saturday Night Live just not funny like it used to be. Like the jokes were normally on point about Presidents but now they're weak at best.
You mean. 1st day in office
i think I'll have to start watching this show again
0:07 She so thick...
Took time to realize Fox released this....
god is a 'she' that's all I know.
Lol... jumping on the bandwagon now simpsons?.., smh.... u used to be the one revealing the real shit
i was not expecting the dog xD
What the hell is this a joke
Can you spot the difference? 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈👿😈😈😈😈😈😈😈 Like if you didn't! SUBSCRIBE if you have a figet spinner!
Im surprised Fox allowed this
I love trumps hair. It soo funny that trumps hair is actually a dog.
Not only Trump sound completely different, his hands are too small
shitting on a public figure, very original. In fact, this might be the most original content on Earth
I love this...
Hey remember when Simpsons was actually funny, damn I miss that
Clever ... and sad.
I choked on the grandpa's part
Simpsons is shit now. "They'll never stop the simpsons..." maybe not but it will turn into a shit show that nobody watches anymore :D
Whoever subscribes me, AND likes this comment, will be subbed back with my *10 ACCOUNTS* Love you guys 😘
Remember when The Simpsons was funny?
I'm not even going to bother to look at the comments below. I'm not suicidal.
Fake episode...
Yeah this is crap.
The jews got to it
The hair tho wtf
And this is what will happen in the future.
A bunch of people complaining about the trumpets crying but i don't see any
Wait, so his hair is a dog AND a robot?
-111 -1 -111 111
remember...Trump has to clean up the messes (stains on dresses included) created by Clinton, George W, and Obama....
OMG!! The dog turning around on his head! LOL
It is sesong 28 and episode...
How do they keep getting away with this - on Fox, of all places?
I see a lot of butthurt Republicunts in the comments section.
Sounds like just like American politics
I'm going to the store anyone want me to pick anything up?
I think its about time the Simpsons left office. Do the people working there realize how stale this show is now? I used to love them but couldn't go past 2000.
When The Simpsons hasn't been funny in 20 years. Brings a tear to my eye.
I always thought Marge was a family values republican and homer... something else
Remember when The Simpsons was funny?
This is fake news!
Pause at 0:07 , why did they have to put that?
Paid for by anybody else 2020...👍🏿
Remember kids! If your opinions dont agree with mine, you're a liberal!
When it comes to trump you have no one to blame but yourselves, even the ones who didnt vote for him your autistic screeching drove the undecided toward him
I'm from Canada and a trump supporter but that was funny you have to admit!
And the butt hurt comments are even better. "Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, you insulted our lord and savior, fuck libtards."
Look at the poor butt hurt Trumpers down vote pure comedy gold.
#StopHateOnTrump
The writers should kill them selfs
I'm surprised at how Matt Groening's animation is getting worse.
"They're taking me back to where I came from!" "Where is that?" "I don't remember!"
Should be chapo Guzman  Pay the Wall  doing this
Who likes tacos♥
As a Trumpeter, I am amused and I approve.  Good job, Simpsons.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN FOREVER
I'll vote for trump again.
I mean, Let's be honest here, did you really expect anything better from Hillary?
thank god i don't live in america
who HERE wants to slap Ivanka on her yellow ass with a full four finger hand & tell her she been a norty character...I would Give her 100 good days 😉
Trump supporters are not triggered like the thin skinned liberals
Lisa Simpson is supposed to be president after Donald.
When you run out of jokes.
Groening always has been a demo-fag
Dang, didn't crack a laugh the whole clip. The simpsons is beyond dead.
I'm a Trump supporter and I find it funny
I remember when the Simpsons had original humor. All this is is a compilation of overdone jokes. They might as well of made an episode of Homer beating a dead horse.
I was expecting more :-/

She prayed? Then Oral Roberts smacked her on the forehead and caused her to do stupid shit
I kept wondering if she got the wrong car by mistake.
Notice how she's on her cellphone during the incident.  It'd be interesting to hear that call!
A typical Alabama woman who voted for Trump.
A Hillary supporter still mad over the election?
What would you do?   Mind your own damn business and watch the show 😂
Alabama: Florida's taint
Hell have no fury like a Woman Scorned.
Liberals are so quick to judge, how do you know there's no one trapped in that car and she helping them get out?

ANY SATSANGI SUBSCRIBE HERE FOR SHABADS AND SATSANGS VIDEOS

3:05 WHAT ARE THOSE???!!!
where is vinkare and herbalisti?
Where is vinkare and herdalist #torillatavataan
did anyone else have bad thoughts about Casey being duct taped to a cart like that next to water :/
Where is vinkare and herbalisti
"what are those?"😂😭
10:00 The view reflecting from your sunglasses is amazing.
This reminds me of the scene in  Toy Story with Woody and the RC car.
Entertain throughout, new sub
A lot of money to be made from Talks, i hope Gary Vaynerchuk didn't rub off on you too much.
I admire your videos Casey but learn to translate Spanish well
I literally had no idea McCauley Culkin was Finnish. Like not one single clue.
hey those spanish gus didn't say that
was the music choice a tribute to tj hunt lol FTB
WHERE IS HERBALISTI AND VINKARE ? :)
episode 22...
That time when Mr. Neistat met The Dudesons and their duct tape. :D
Felt like the end of a TJ Hunt video
YEA, THE DUDESONS <3
man it feels insulting to have seen Casey duct taped to a stupid car for almost 2 hrs. Clearly he didn't enjoy it, neither did I. i didn't expect those Finnish were this terrible..
I'm sitting here like.....where do I know this guy from..... oh yeah, it's the Dudesons.
Not sure what all the fuzz is about, but doesnt casey himself also do weird shit?
Casey when you were on top of that car.. you looked like you were thinking hard about being strapped on to a fast moving vehicle!
Are you comming to Sweden?:)
So many people in this comment section speaking on the behalf of Casey Neistat. I believe Casey can speak for himself, AND I don't think Casey would have agreed to do this if he didn't like the idea.
Guys if he didn't want to be duct taped to the top, he would have just said no. He was just having fun obviously. Don't make such a big deal about it lol
Very funny vlog but the people in the bicycles actually didn't said that
Casey looked like he was bored as fuck tied up to that car.
goes to finland to get his hand checked for free ;)
No way, you met up with the Dudesons!
#Where is vinkare's and herbalisti's  ? video
how long are you going to be in finland because i live in finland
The dudesons are the best. Helsinki looks amazing
It's always hard to admit topping yourself for doing the stupidest thing ever done.
You looking bored strapped at the roof of the car.
i would have done it too casey
That Blue Scholars beat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "Inkwell" produced by Sabzi at the 7:00 minute mark! Wrong tag on the artist, unless the artist stole that beat and changed the tempo?
Be careful Casey - we'd all miss you, and you have a beautiful daughter. Not actually sure how dangerous this is, but I hope someone else spent the time to figure it out for you!
White is Herbalisti and Vinkare? #torillatavataan
Casey cmon didn't put that part where you fell 😂😂😂
Should have at least let you drive the thing
where is vinkare and herbalisti #torillatavataan
Casey wheres the boys recorded clip they take your camera and record clip
Was the translation in Finnish real? Anyone?
You are a legend!! I got into trouble for watching your videos on our honeymoon 😝
I'm glad that your pinky finger is fine. Very creative way to put you on top of a racing car LOL :)
OMG That brxtn crewneck - SO DOPE!
where is vinkare and herbalisti #torillatavataan
sometimes its ok to say no to stuff
ID of this Brixton sweatshirt ?
WTF is Casey doing ? As much as I hate Prank vs Prank, when Casey and Jesse collaborate its not at the risk of life.
i'm laughing my ass off - the casey neistat finnish edition has been awesome.
Where is herbalisti and vinkare
I wonder if Tj hunt pooped himself at 8:50
Casey: can I ask you a question.....what're those?  Casey really from New York 😂
where is vinkare and herbalisti #torillatavataan
*Breaks Hand, hangs out with Dudesons* Not the best combo but I'm glad you did it xD
Wheres Ville and Herba? #torillatavataan
were vinkare And herbalist video material?
where is Herbalisti and Vinkare #torillatavataan
Who else thought that you were watching a TJ Hunt vlog, with that music in the background?!!
Thank you for your art today Casey!
I live on finland
The kid didn't just die on Verrukt. He was beheaded. My wife and I rode it the day it opened. It was amazing.
I did 7 of them
Could at least say where they are
any chance you could mention my GoFundMe campaign please. GoFundMe.com/help-me-get-a-scooter
I can only imagine the butteflies you feel on those slides!! I need this!!
R.I.P. that guys' hat in #24
Where are you guys
been on the cyclone in west edmonton mall
Oh man I love Dark Hole, it's a great thrill that doesn't scare the life out of me.
going on a trip in an rv this summer! can't wait! (I'm probably gonna go in july)
Woodlands is in Devon UK near Dartmouth not in the US&A!!!
I've ridden the Jumeirah Sceirah (Pronounced Scarer) in Dubai. I've ridden a fair few rides in my time but this was something else. I felt like i'd been beaten up at the end of it.
Everyone and their Grandma has done this list.
I got stuck in the L2 because I was too light
Ive Been On The Black Hole
I'd love to try waterslides but most have steep stairs and steep stairs and I don't mix. I've never been on the second floor of my younger sisters house cause the stars are too steep
All lost twenty five videos feel like click baits.
I've done the black hole, my fav :)
not here to watch the video. just here to dislike for the ridiculously click bait thumbnail.
Mike you showed so many from wet and wild ☹️
I'm glad Australia actually got on the list. We don't get on many lists
good Lord need to find better stock footage of these water slides. there was a few that you didn't even show the outside design ...
Nope. All of these get an "oh gods hell no" from me. Give me a nice, secure, dry, coaster any day.
I almost died in a water slide.
Give it enough time and every waterslide will kill someone -except #3. I can't figure out which of those drops was supposed to be near vertical, and if it was the first, it's only, like, 10 feet it looks like.
I would totally ride every one of them!  :-D Awesome list, List25!
Where is #5, #2, & #1 located?
The 747 water slide is the shit
Do a top 25 list of scams on the internet please
For the first time, there's something on a list I've actually experienced. The Kamikaze basically gives you an enema.
Wait what happens if you dont make it around the loop at 2:03??? you're stuck lol
where was the blackhole?
Disco H20 and black hole are at wet wild Orlando which just closed down last December
For # 24, i was able to go on it 2 times before it got shit down, I call myself lucky, it was so fun, plus it was a weight error that caused the boy's death
I did the leap of faith on a vacation
You know what would have been nice?  If they would have told us where most of these slides were.
I live near #12. It's only an hour away.
What's with YouTube? I normally get their notification's about when these vids come out. I had to go find it almost 10 hours after it went out. What else can YouTube screw up even better?
Should of stated where each ride is located
24 no longer exists
the dolphin plunge one. I've been on it. it's amazing!
the one in Dartmouth Massachusetts doesn't exist nor is there camping anywhere.
at Blue bayou/Dixie landing park in Baton rouge Louisiana we have almost ever style of water slide you said in one park
I believe all of these exist
I want my money back I believe they exist. I'm quite let down
F u for not putting the names of the slides in here
You could have told us where these all are...half of these, you didn't say where we could ride them!
Noah's ark!! I love that place.
No Black Ananconda? Now I am ashamed...
Aqua loop is sooooo fun but scary as well!!!!!!!! A must do!!!!!!!!!!!!
I went down Magic Mountain's Kamikaze......twice. What the video showed, wasn't it. It's wide open. :0
You didn't mention Summit Plummet is at Blizzard Beach in Disney World, FL.
Who thought it was a good idea to let a 10 year old on a waterslide that drops 17 stories, bad parents.
I love right by the veruct in Kansas City (24) the boy who died was actually a girl in my grades little brother.
#9???  There is no Woodland Park near Dartmouth MA, I've lived here all my life.
Disco H2O, Drag Racer, and The Blackhole are all at WetnWild Orlando... Which closed down in January this year. They've deconstructed allmost all the slides already. 😢
🔈🔉🔊   say Mike ?  thx for sharing . . .  one suggestion preferably no !  food consumption before take - off  lol  :)-)     + wouldn't hurt to have a change of dipiers  🎢
I am completely terrified of water loops. I've always had a fear of getting stuck in a tube so I'm sticking with slides that only go down and sidewards
Great video.  I'd try them all.  Where is #1?
Umm ship not boat
I remember going on the racing one when I was younger and screaming😂
You really need to check your facts.
OMG 2 222 221 SUBS AND BEFORE YOU HAD 2 222 223 SUBS!!! SO CLOSE TO 2 222 222 SUBS!!! :O
i WANT TO TRY ALL OF THESE!
Sounds Dangerous. I remember someone had a fatality at one of these slides, the person was decapitated!
The ride down on some these would be awesome, it's walking UP ALL the steps? no thanks!
I've ridden no. 20, its at Atlantis Hotel, Bahamas. It's good but the slower ride next to it gives better view of the sharks.
No 12 is at Wet n Wild on the Gold Coast, and it's 1-4 people. Black Hole isn't really that good, I've been on ones that are completely dark and purposely stop you to scare you half way.
I was on the aqua loop on the Gold Coast on holiday but honestly it's not even that amazing, good but not amazing
had to give this list a thumbs down, because I want to know where these slides are located.  I expect more from you guys - why are you forcing your viewers to do the research themselves?
16 WISCONSIN PEEPS
Some of the entries you say where its located, some you dont. Some you show good video of, some you barely show anything to get an idea of what the slide looks like.  .. thats why I downvoted
Roses are red violets are blue  I got click baited and so did you
Number 3 is like in every waterpark..
For me it's 25 insane water slides you'll want to avoid lol
I hate loops​... neck problems run in my family and loops are neck killers :(
What about any of the slides at 'Siam Park' in Tenerife?
The Kamikaze(#23) is a drop slide not a tube slide like the footage you used showed.
no.12 is at Wet 'n' Wild in Gold Coast, Australia
people have died on number 24
I've Been to the leap of faith. (or something very similar I can't remember)
3 of these were essentially the same; not hating or trolling, I just wouldn't go on them because...fuck a looping waterslide. Lol
been on number 5 its a great slide!
No thank you
😦 Bill&Ted's Excellent Adventure was RIGHT !
sorry for the delay, folks. hope you liked this series.
i saw you in Alone on History channel.
That Trailer Park Boys quote though!
BAMMM son, and there was fire :)
I enjoy watching your videos I feel like doing the same any tips
*frog jumps out of hand* Peace bro
Its so it hugs your hip
You're videos are so....calming. Helps me relax. I swear I can watch these for hours and just relax. And they make me excited too, they make me want to go places, explore! I love it! Thanks for the video
It seems Canadians really struggle with getting cameras to focus. I the words of another Canadian YouTuber: "Focus, you Fack!"
dude have u no feeling in your finger tips, grabbing the fuccin coals
Been watching for a while now, really relaxing keep it going 👍🏼
Defiantly worth the wait, you should go back there sometime
This was awesome, thanks for another amazing video 😊 can't wait to see what's next
It isn't getting that played out man, try new things and do what you love but don't stray too far from what you do because that's what we love to watch!!!
Awesome videos!!  Can't wait till school gets out so that I can pack up and go camping with my children.  I got my first Eno for Christmas and can't wait to use it in the wild!
Really enjoy your videos. Your camera work is first rate. I hope you make many more!
try some sea salt, coarse black pepper, a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil on the lamb chops. I make it up before hand and put it in a small squeezey bottle  its fantastic!
Love the videos Joe!
yes on the canteen
Try to get them cut thinner.    They will cook faster and pickup more flavor.
Hey Joe, I had a question. I always see you bringing steaks and bacon and other meats. How do you keep them from going bad?
You said it... you are soo lucky to live in that area! I live on Long Island (NY) and some areas here are beautiful also but I always loved Canada. Enjoy!
Just one question: how do you poop?
that is exactly why they made them that way. when they were on my load bearing vest in the army they fit perfectly right on your side
omg that was jim from trailer park boys at 10:41 😂😂😂 I like you alot more now.
I can't watch your videos without craving a steak and a beer. Damn you Joe! Lol
I love the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings!
This was an awesome video!!!
I feel like these videos really connect me to my inner-natureness, I love them so much. They also express my huge love for the outdoors! :DD
Joe bushcraft. nice Lahey reference be one with the liquor bud!
trailer park boys reference = subscribed
....i have a question Joe...... do you burn your trash while out on an overnight or do you bring it back home with you?? what is your opinion on burning camp trash while trekking/camping?
I completely lost it with the Jim Lahey impression haha XD
Easter white cedar
Hi Joe, what technical pant do you have on in this video? Looks good.
I would love to see Joe try manual focus in his videos.
There should be a "P2" in the title.
Joe, you need to  work out those muscles of yours in a gym!  lol
Does your cedar wood pop  out of the fire like ours in Texas?
can you talk to a real person at audible books? I thinks I would like to try it but I have questions.
i enjoy watchinng you build camps
Can't believe you are hitting 300k subscribers man, but you deserve every single one of them, keep it up Joe! Huge fan from Finland!
You should only turn chops once
Joe, great videos man! Could you use a small rock instead of the spoon? Or what else could you use? Tnx Max
amazing man !!! thanks for this
thumbs up for the trailer park boys reference!
I love the reference to Trailer Park Boys! lol
u should put part 2 in the title
Hey Joe what pants are you wearing
Thanks for the in depth bowdrill tutorial, I always seem to miss something in them
What brand of spork is that?
I love the trailer park boys too much
What is the fluid capacity on that handy little blue water pouch and where can we find them?
Hey Joe  Whr do u park ur car when crow land camping? I assume it is crown land.
3:21 Jesus is that you?
I live in Quebec, how/why do you eat at your campsites? We have bears here yo.
I shouldn't watch your videos when I'm hungry. Those steaks look juicy AF.
You should've rendered some of the fat from the lamb chops in the bottom of the canteen and sautéed the broccoli a bit for flavor
Only a minute in and I liked.  Good for you getting a sponsor; better than begging for money or charging ppv.  'Fellowship' may be the perfect book for a camping trip; the first half of it is nothing but.
cool video! What is the brand/model of the long spork you're using? TIA
Love the vids man maybe if you need some new designs hit me up 🤙🏿
awesome series. Cheers from Sweden!
THE WATER BOTTLE IS A HIP FLASK,ITS CARRIED ON UR BELT SO ITS  SHAPED TO FIT UR HIP
The beer reaction... awesome.
If you want to use the filter during the winter time at the end of the day or not in use just put it in your sleep system or underneath your warmth layers. Good vid Joe always entertaining
This was an unbelievable series.
You cook & keep food in camp.  What do you do to deter bears from camp?
Ey I've just found out ur channel it's my style I love what ur doing u know what's up dude, I wish I could kick it with you out there. Keep doing you bro!
162 vegetarians disliked the video?
Damn sonnn! you killed the broccoli! Next up on the menu - flying squirrels caught the bushcrafty way.
still loving the videos man all the way over here in Australia.. keep up the good work 😉
The canteen is supposed to go on an ALICE belt and fit to your side. Still a tried and true design. Cheers!
i believe the kidney shape was originally to make it more comfortable on a webbing belt.
Joe!! You should train Scout to read to you. Cheers to you both!!
keep them coming, love the mini beer review.
Man I love camping near running water and pines. Awesome spot
Dude, audible is amazing.   I don't normally care for sponsor plugs but I've had nothing but good experiences with the service!  If you're into sherlock holmes you can get the complete works for 1 credit ($90 item)
I giggled when you said quarter zip 😎
lmao was that one quote from Trailer Park Boys? I laughed my ass off when you said "Let- Let the liquor do the thinkin ra-Randy"
Love the videos keep up the goodwork
Come to Australia. We will feed you all the lamb you can eat.
I love your vids
The Lord of the Rings and Silmarillion are my favorite to bring with me to read in the woods!
I want a sausage water t-shirt...

very nice:))
COMMENT with your favorite blooper!
they said toronto when it was tampa bay
2:14 he says hickies lead
Once I thought I got walked when there was only 1 ball
I was at the game for #7
The shcwarber fair ball
For number one the pitcher should have tagged the runner
That last one lol.
Hunter Pence falling down and allowing Charlie Blackmon to hit an inside the park homerun should be on here
The worst thing about number 7 is Bob Carpenter's astonishing stupidity
Biggest fail is the blue jays season
#1 hahahahaha
The numbers get in the way  Please fix...
These are a good reminder that no matter how good you are at something you can still screw it up at any given moment.

Wow, 102 pitches by the top of the fifth inning. 😨
I was at the game at 3:30
Have to like the Mets dropping Galvis' popup. And the Yankees pitcher falling on the mound against the Orioles.
Frustrating how lucky the cubs always get
my favorite was seth smiths in the park homerun, but I am biased
Number 6... I think you Dun goofed
#17 That throw was so on point it hit the bag. wow.
My dad said if I got 333 subscribers by Monday he will quit smoking (No Joke)
I didn't see it cause everyone told me not to watch it, but Pence had a missed catch that allowed an inside the park home run. That was probably terrible. 😭😭😭
High quality video. Great job
0th! Nobody called it!
why is #6 Toronto blue Jays

Why was she gonna spread the Nutella with her fingers
I wouldn't do the paint and glue skittles one cause I don't want my friends to die
The fake drink spill looks so fake lmao
Eating nail polish and laundry detergent...? Ewwwww!
This isnt very good because your 'best friend' has to eat glue twice, soap once and have their coat covered in glitter so they will be in hospital and HATE you.

I did the mouse prank  on my brother Ben check out his Channle Benjamin rosier
THE NUTELLA TO U WANT TO GIVE YOUR FRIEND DETERGENT

Laptop white Cleese stuff
I don't think they ment that as a drink spill accept for something else

Is it only lamb they like to cook there, no pork, goat or beef.
Wait what? The first meal in the video is only BREAKFAST? Wow! Bring it! These food look GREAT.
everything made of lamb loool
The chinese people realy needs to learn how to queue properly.
Ohhh, those noodles looked sooooo good.
How do you remain in shape man? All that dishes would make me fat in just a week!!!
That's a lot food, no over weight people. Cuz no sweets.

Drinking game: Take a shot everytime he says "heaven"

For me listening to him speaking Chinese is so Cringy XD
wow,., oh my god., man u enjoyed the taste n we just had fun watching u .... keep posting
Do they use the arabic alphabet there mainly or the mandarin chinese alphabet?  I see both on the signs.
FREE EAST TURKESTAN!!!!
21:25 oh yeah.....that's lamb heaven alright..😂
Muslim women MUST wear the veil and NOT show any part of their body or hair .
Be safe in these halal Muslim streets lol!

.36 cents for that bread in china ! a lot of money
Omg. The meat at the end. Mouth watering!!!
Ar ha, don't line up in China (expect HK). They don't have this concept. Just fight for it.  Next time you should just shout out 小弟,一排一腿.
I'm an avid meat eater but why dont folk like the food ranger not be honest and say "Halal is fucking barbaric"?
what city are were you in ?
How are you not fat??
DEEP CHINA!!!!!
super work bro u r greater than TCL ....
YOU HAD ME AT LAST MEAL 😂😂😂 DAMN I WANT THAT
@18:40 loooooooooooooooool
hard to be unique food in a country where people like to eat dog
These people are so friendly, love it!
This kinda made me homesick :'(
Trev keep doing this ! its awesome!... the only bad thing to see ure videos is that u make me hungry all the time ! haha, see ya !
where ever you are someone is building a meal !;) and i own a supermarket and eat 4 times a week pizza and nodels !;(((
whats the first song in the video?
China is beautiful
OMG ITS ON TRENDING.
There's no queuing system in China, first shout first served
the facial characteristics are so different yet similar its interesting how each province has slightly different features and styles
Anybody notice they saying nigga
I'm high. This video caused me to eat. Fucking propaganda.
Mmmmmmm that lamb looks good
they really like lamb. every meat is lamb.
Trust Trevor to be at the front of the cue but get served last typical Canadian too nice
18:40 Why they ignore you? Besides your chinese is very fluid
Does Trevor have a hollow leg?
so my chinese parents recommends that I do not eat street food because it will give me some darn good chocolate river, and also because parts of the food is outdated or fake.
can you imagine that guy cutting bones with a cissor shaking your hand? ^^'
This guy moans a lot
Last one is really cool man
STOP MAKING NOISES LIKE YOU ARE HAVING A ORGASM LOLLLL
DONT GET TOO EXCITED, YOU TUBE IS NOT GOING TO PAY YOU LIKE IT USED TO...I SUGGEST YOU FIND ANOTHER HOBBY AND STOP LIVING OFF OTHER CULTURES...U HOMO
wtf with those dislikes? this is a beautiful video.   also guys, on th wall, it says guard the unity of people (here means all ethnic groups) with life.   very touchy.
I'm so glad this video is on front page. This is the kind of content I want
"It's hard to get it in" -Trevor James, 2017
AT MEAT HEAVEN YOU WERE TO CONFUSED ... JUST LOOKING TO OTHER PEOPLE THEY ARE HAVING MEAT AND I AM STILL STANDING WITH AN EMPTY PLATE ... HAHAHHA
A question. Does Ting Ting get to eat the same food that you eat ?
I love how Trev keeps a smile even if the food is 1 out of 10.  You stay classy San Diego...
The last part, salute you man how patiently and calmly you handle the situation
Take a shot every time you here him go "MMMMMMMMMMMMMM" or "Woah" Report back. will watch this tonight xD
Patience is key
Great video! Make me think of those days in Xinjiang
love this video! feeling hungry now!
roaster lamps serviceless,  not recommended to come over there, starving gets lost immediately.
Yea but it's fake food
This looks like a huge advertisement for china
hi Trevor I love your videos plz come to Pakistan and enjoy our country 's food too looking forward to it
In India we have a similar veggie rice called 'Pulav' which looks very similar to the pilaf shown in this video..
uyghur turks... you can see the resemblance with the turks of turkey.
It sucks that that golden retriever will be dinner 😭 its a joke guys chill
made me go to the restaurant at midnight and order pilov. damn you :)
You're the most Canadian person I've ever seen.
how mny ti,es did he say Mmmmmmmm
You gotta stop with Aahmmm, Uhmmmm, Oooohhh, Woooow, makes me not want to watch you videos. Just enjoy the food and give us your feedback.
OMG, your video is on Trending. :O
Did anybody noticed the Chinese and Arabic sings?! Amazing place
I am sorry for this guy  who treated u not well. but still u not any angry about him.
19:00 awful.. I feel sorry for Trevor 😡
There are so many delicious street foods in every corner of China, with unique local features. Haha..
lol from 18:41 best part Trevor was trying hard for the owner to notice him to give him the lamb, lol trevor you need to be savage in some times and give the plate in front of his face, cannot stop laughing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Street food in China are cooked using gutter oil.

hi my friends enter in my channel please!!!! :) best games for kids here in my canal!!
2:26 Thanks for supporting rabbits haha :)  But we eat other things as well you know ;)
the level of detail is staggering looks like a really fun day out
up until the amazing robot at the end that looked REALLY boring.
I do not like this.
Was there a drop?
Wow that looks like a lovely ride, so pretty and peaceful. That that will be a great ride to go on to unwind and cool off during a long AK day
How long is this ride? I hope it's not another frozen length attraction! The video makes it seem EXTREMELY short. Tell me there's a giant show room with lots going on that was not shown.
It is beautiful.. and I am so glad that they are using real audio animatronics again. (Unlike the video overlay in Frozen and Mine Train, which looks really bad to me.)
Thanks for sharing this.  Our AP preview is May 16th.  Cannot wait!
Although it looks absolutely beautiful, it seems boring AF!!!! Seriously looks like the most boring boat ride ever. I was really looking forward to see what they would do, and I'm so disappointed
This all looks very interesting and I'm amazed at the tech but who exactly is Pandora for? Is there really such a huge following for this? Someone fill me in here I feel like I'm missing something.
I think this place will be nice to walk around, but not much else. The banshees better be mind blowing if this is all they've come up with.
Great video. As others have said, it's visually really beautiful, but not the home-run I was hoping it would be. A bit underwhelming and disappointing. For it to literally take years to build, I expected more.
Avatar itself has become irrelevant. They took too long to build and most lost interest.
Maybe a camera fails to capture the magic, but the video certainly makes it look like an underwhelming and sparsely engaging ride that lacks a story.
A nice ride to take a nap on.
the fluidity in the audio-animatronic was breathtaking
Is there any kind of drop or hill? Any reason why there is not a wheelchair boat on this ride?
Looks like a Rainforest Cafe.  I did like that the leaves moved when the lizards were walking on them.
its so short of a ride what the heck
#screenz OVER 5 years to build an awful, slow screen ride with a single animatronic! Universal can do that in a little over one year like they did with Reign of Kong Skull island!
Beautiful!  The animotronic and visual effects are amazing!   ❤
Blacklight adventure? I guess this is interesting if you're a big fan of the film... Nothing for me here.
great video, guys. Hope you had a great time!
Any drops on this ride?
hasan reported fake news! sue him!
hasan fucking killed it at the dinner YAAAS
I bet he Has an Ménage every weekend...
Hasan your correspondence speech was epic! In the current climate of hypocrisy and insanity, sincerely, thank you sir for our cherished laughter.
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO RUN DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP,YOU DISGRACEFUL,GO BACK TO.YOUR SCREWED UP COUNTRY,I HOPE THEY KICK YOU OUT ,YOU.ABUSING THE SYSTEM
honestly he was really boaring
Drumpf's supporters are already asleep.
They won't even improve the fence? LMAO.
@ 4:03 I hate Trevor's fake laughter
you would disable comments you muppets
Black(s) for trump. One crazy white guy who escaped from the asylum, broke into a tanning salon, and fell asleep in a tanning booth.
Donald Trump talks like he's reading a words on a screen
2:38 - 2:39 Someone PLEASE make a GIF of what Trump's doing right there xD
3:35 - that child's mother and father should be arrested for child abuse.  To think, people that stupid are breeding these days...
The one black guy in his crowd is probably someone he paid to be there. Then draws tons of attention to him to show hes not racist lol
I want a Trump supporter to explain to me what Trump did in office without bringing up Obama, Hillary, the election, "fake news," or any other irrelevant thing that has nothing to do with the election.
Trump doesn't care about anything he says. He knows his supporters are really dumb.
No one wants to build a wall
People: demand trump release his taxes Trump: the election is over Also trump: still holds campaign and victory rallies
Insert libtard trump hating comment below🖕🖕...can't believe people still watch these and news...nothing but biased and made up shit...this generation is full of the biggest pussies
I seriously think that Trump has mental issues.
Yeah Drumpf voters, go back to sleep. Thanks for wrecking America. Sweet dreams.
Poor idiots at the rallies. They're like roaches
great satire
Hasan fucking Minhaj. I love that man.
Hasan is a fucking goat lol
Hillary lost because she cheated https://counterpropa.com/7-jaw-dropping-revelations-hearings-motion-dismiss-dnc-fraud-lawsuit/
so so president trump bad word
Not funny Daily show. Totally not funny to make jokes about a alternate reality where the orange cheeto gets shit canned...
If Trump made the wall happen with a kickstarter it would be a major win for him. Stop giving him great ideas, Trevor.

He definitely did make the headlines alright, even all the way here in Bangladesh.
Hail to Hasan!

Trump is running for reelection after his first 100 days #PresidentBannon #MAGA2020
How can you tell when Pence is lying? His mouth is moving.
"I am no one to call he president a liar" (4.29). This is the first time that I am disappointed in Trevor Noah for making this statement. Why not call the president a liar? He is one!

Tramp is right, his 100 day achievements are significant, he's still not been impeached.
Tramp is right, his 100 day achievements are significant, he's still not been impeached.
Trevor is anti women.
they gathered together... lol
Nepotism and steak sauce?  The president eats steak with ketchup.    I'm being dead serious....
Wow, his rallies are a sausage fest full of meat-heads and their obedient wives who vote the way their husbands tell them.  I've SEEN women say this!
Someone should cut off his pinky- and ringfinger, so golf isn't that fun for little Trump anymore 😧
MORE RONNIE CHANG
"All right Jeff Sessions, ready the harpoon" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Dear media, please stop covering this idiot. We know he is good for ratings but you are enabling him.
Why are you not talking about Trump using the White power hand signal. #NotOk
Only one guy holding up "Blacks for Trump" sign.
Mike pence is a fake Christian! Complicit
If anyone didn't understand what Trump meant when he called the Correspondents' Dinner a sad event, Hasan Minhaj's "jokes" at the end of this were the perfect explanation.
Hassan Minaj was hilarious!
Trump proved that the religious right is full of shit! Pence claims to be a devout Christian. Hypocrisy at the highest level!
nonpartisan. hit repubs and democrats alike. hasan slaughtered that dinner. ate it. and then spat it back out because muslims dont roll like that
Trump is fugly and that's why his supporters like him
Yeah, go to sleep and do your best to stay asleep until 2020 when this nightmare ends.
Nope...still the idiot
I feel bad for the children of trump supporters... they will be brainwashed for the rest of their lives following the influence of an imbecile
So Trump supporter, what have Trump done for you guys in his 100 days of presidency? What has he done to make America great again and how ?
hrc would have started WW3 by now
Why do all his supporters look inbred?
I can't believe i paid taxes to this guy, i hope my money went to schools and those without. . .
"Jeff sessions get the harpoon" fucking killed me xD
1:31 I'll go to sleep comforted by the fact that the wall seems like a further and further away possibility with every day.
Is Trump actually BRAGGING about being a chicken shit?
Hasan should be happy that he topped YouTube's trending.
look it's pro-corruption fuckface Trevor Noah.
you are a moron. trump is lacking support of congress, otherwise he would definitely reach the goals he had set
0:56 "On Saturday, to MOCK his 100th day..." yep
Has anyone else been having huge trouble getting these videos to load? Like every video on this channel.
He said HELLA!!! Bay Area coming up!!
Trump and supporters need to create a Go Fund Me Page for their wall...Let them pay for it...
I like what they did at the end. it's proves that Donald Trump can't take a joke. he is no man >:(
vary got water but not Dengares so faltu

It's a good thing you don't need to read this... because you already know the words...

Great song but how can you read this???? Lyric vid? Don't think so!

Katy Perry is trying to read the lyrics. I never knew she was also a gaga fan.
in my hammock chilling to this song

How the heck do you read it????

Lyric reading tip: Stare at one spot, like the top or bottom, and the lyrics are not that intense, so you'll be able to read it.
oh my eyes!!!!
Fuck lyric . my sister can't read this
This lyrics does'nt help anything to me, anyone else feel the same way?
She better warm us before she drops a killer video for this...😂
This Is Dope. I Was Wondering How The Person Behind This Did It. & If You're Reading This, Nice Use Of Newton :P

They want to please him because they want his inheritance

Jagr will play this long but in the NHL
This is so cool.
What a fucking badass.
lovely channel you got there! congratulations! i only subscribed yesterday, but i've watched everything you posted since. you definitely deserve more subscribers. keep it up!
I'm 97 and play hockey so this title is false.
That's some fine mustache.
I think he's left his Mark in the world :)
amazing video like always, but is there some weird noise happening within the reds? or is it called digital artifacts or something?
I hope this man doesn't die, he's a great man
That's the same ice area I played in
I'm proud to know his grandson !
The way he is moving and talking along with his energy it's safe to say he'll be possibly be one of the oldest people ever to live.
Inspiring! Great attitude
Legendary, hope I can still kick a ball as good as he can play hockey when I'm old!
The guy deserves a Hockey Hair Lifetime Achievement award, too.
2 words DUSTY BENDER,  but good for him thats awesome
as someone who lives in minnesota i can say that this is completely normal
what a beauty eh. good on him. keep it going buddy
Manly mustache is manly
Love this video, the guy is so nice and epic
man I just love to see old people that are still completely verbally coherent! hope this fucker plays until hes 200
This guy is one bad motherfucker. He's been playing since before they had pads or goalie masks. Respect, loads of respect to him. @ 2:17 GO JETS GO!
My great uncle is in his late 80s and he's still playing hockey too!!
He looks like an older lanny McDonald lol
Good for him 😊
mustaches on the fleek
Love this guy's handlebar moustache
I wish more old people took care of themselves like this
That's funny because I've skated at that rink
I like this guys mustache the most
sarcastick but cute
The hockey stick is his cane and the puck is his dentures. He uses his skate blades to whittle.
He's a fukin beaut!!
What a savage!!!!! pay attention youngsters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
joking aside this is awesome
and a few other things....to loosen 👆
wrong oldest player is Putin.....
does the hockey keep him alive or does he keep hockey alive, hmmmm? That is the question
it's sad to realize that a 95 year old man gets more physical activity than you do
More hockey please!!!!!!!!
and i thought jagr is too old to play
Me and him share the same birthday lol I hope he sees his
What's next? The oldest fapper ever?
You did a great job keep em coming, seems content doesn't run out.....😳
no Rusty? damn shame because I liked this channel. every time you find 1 you like they chang it.
stick to the helm Rusty!
I have a feeling Mr Paulides has , sadly, a long career of books to write in the future
I had no idea someone was keeping up with this subject other than Paulides! excellent
It's murder. Always murder. Unless it's Bigfoot. Then it's Bigfoot. Unless it's aliens. Then it's aliens. Unless it's alien Bigfoot murder. Then you're triple screwed. Rest in peace.
I wish the poor families had some closure. I can't imagine how it feels to have your loved one just disappear and never knowing what happened.
Boy this shit gets scarier all the time.😱TY.
Are these part of Agenda 21, Hunger Games style control? Scare the bejesus out of us cattle so we don't want to go out into the wild?
Good job Carl!  Maybe just  lower the mic volume a teeny weeny bit.
Turned it off when he said Fam........seriously don't have enough time in your life to say the other 3 letter's....... ily ?
What is a Co-Hose?
Can we request impressions from Rusty/Carl? I'm thinking something current like Trump? "These missing people were the best, the best let me tell you they were great"
Why didn't Rusty just wait to make this until he got back?
well done carl,really enjoyed you're work 😀
Strange they didn't mention Zach. He was a 20 year old kid who went missing the same weekend Jacob went missing from the same park....really disturbing.
they were eaten
Great video Carl :)
Squeal like a pig! Someone's there!
BTW is the description supposed to say "co-hose"? 😂
I miss Rusty in this video, but Carl definitely grew on me in the 16 minutes and 35 seconds we spent with him.
weird..I never go alone I always take Smith AND Wesson with me!! Yes I know it's illegal..don't care I am alive and have had negative encounters that were prevented by my friends ..without casualties..
prefer rusty. wasnt a fan of the comical commentary.
is rusty missing???
Caution ? Lol they come for yo ass thats it , you can be rambo it dont matter
oh why oh why do these people never have shoes ???
You sound to upbeat for these kind of videos. No offense.
hope someone is found
I'm not a believer, but big foot? Give me a good horse, dog and a good rifle, GPS TO BE Worn ON ME 24/ 7
Hot take: Rusty is Carl, Carl is Rusty. And there you have it.
Meh. Many people insist on going on these solo hikes. Good thing there are no wild animals and/or derelicts in these places, right?
rusty, fire this guy. your monotone voice is what sells your videos. this guy sounds happy and excited about a dark topic. he ain't gonna get it done bro
Good video from this channel as always. Carl you did a great job filling in.
When I see a much looked-forwarded to new Rusty, I want to hear it from Rusty....
So use to Rusty's voice, well done anyway
Oh cmon we want old rust back!!!
What is it about the shoes - I would love to know ???
Your voice is great.... for a comedy channel.
Cool of you to fill in but you're super energetic for such a somber topic
good work mate.. ridicule me if anybody likes but I think it's aliens.. it's the only answer that fits each case.. r.i.p to the missing.
Thanks for filling in and the great video!
I miss the sad violin music
I'm sorry but this guy is annoying as hell, bring back rusty voice!!!
I think I am going to put GPS locators on both me and my hiking boots. That way if I wind up missing authorities will find me as well as find out where all the shoes are going.
Hurry back rusty !  Nice video
this guy is so fucking annoying unsuscribe
Most of the missing people's' names are of German origin...!
How about bears and mountain lions for an explanation?
great job Carl! more misteries! thank you!
Missing 411 is the best!
Good job Carl!
You know. Don't swim alone, don't hike alone 😞
this guy did a good job. better than the people who are downing him.
No mystery , accidents happen and the world is full of not so bright people !
Carl you did a great job!!
These videos are so interesting but your voice is not Rusty's.
Hillary Sharma was a suicide whose body was recovered.. For those interested http://www.websleuths.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?60-Missing-Forum-Discussion
Great job, voice, and research. thank you very much...from England.
Best ending in a missing persons vid ever! Great idea...
good job carl
I want rusty back. it would have been worth the wait
the voice doesn't matter it's the mystery that we need to talk about
Great job Carl. Refreshingly different take on it & complementary to Rusty's style. Thanks for changing the music! I'm addicted to Paulides and can't wait for him to do another series of interviews.
Is this new man narrating the video high on drugs?  Horrible voice and music, everything. I only want Rusty. Where the hell is he? Thumbed down !
Such a multi layer'd mystery and unresolved heart ache for family to deal with.
you get lost, die from exposure, and a badger comes along buries and eats you.
I only want Rusty doing these videos, without his voice, music, his unique personal touch to the stories, I'd not want to watch them. Is he missing too ?
sorry carl but don't give up your day job
Thanks for watching guys! Would love for you guys to watch some vlogs and subscribe if you enjoy them (don't need to subscribe to enter the giveaway though!). More drop tests and destruction videos coming soon!

Is the bride a girl or a gay?
You are Great!! los amo!! This song is amazing! This is going to be crazy!!! This song is the best that I have listened!! #ILoveBleachers!!
im disgusted  by the amount of spit at 3:59
He's like Jimmy Kimmel's brother or something.
My One.......never found......why final death.......end fun to see us die.....   fantasy
Remember, don't take the money
omg this music video got me figuring out still
i loved this omg
FUCK THE LGBTQ+. ITS A DISEASE. WAKE UP PEOPLE. DONT FOLLOW THE HERD THINKING ITS RIGHT.
I'm so fuckin obsessed with this song!!
i so love the bleachers.
Don't make a 1 min long intro when you are an unknown band man...
Trump's America...Mail order brides
not only the music video starts late they added more story in the middle of the video? its so bad to listen to it,
as of May 2017, it is clear that Jews Control American Media.
That was cute c:
where are the right wing death sqads if you need them
Impressive.
is he the guy from fun
Cool whores on the thumbnail!
THIS IS SO UNDERRATED
I was wondering why i felt like i was gonna throw up while watching this........ Then i saw that Lena Dunham directed it😀
omg!!!! is that Lorde??? too old😭
love this song!
Bleachers are the shit!
Youtube recommendations are awesome
Bad acting alert. Music is fine.
WOOW! THIS IS MY SECOND FAVORITE SONG AFTER GREEN LIGHT THIS YEAR <3
Soo Jack is being pussywhipped.
Pure 80's! it's amazing!  what do you think guys?
Here at 85k
This video is so bad
Girl from Arrested Development
so damn aesthetically pleasing
I'm kinda confused, but like, I'm not mad about it.
I love this aspect ratio
Hopefully Lorde forgives you for letting Grandma sing her part in the video
Search party anyone?
I need to go bleach my eyes after watching this shit video.
I hit thumbs down because I don't like videos with long introductions and that long pause in the middle.
Cool song, wierd video. I guess liberals call that art. Next time just have hot twins twerking it will get more views.
It's a testament to Jacks songwriting ability that he can make a song about an incestous child molesting manatee like Lena dunham sound so freaking good.
I'm not sure how I'm supposed to feel.
the bad acting but the good music
I'm here because of Lorde but this song is truly great anyways
I don't know what to say about this
The 80s called. They want their their _Wave_ back.
she dun him a solid, never woulda worked out
what the fuck did I just watch
Don't take the money. Don't take my honey.
I feel like the videos for these songs are all very....opposite of the lyrics.
Lena dunhams "boyfriend" had to fuck that pig to get that music video.
I really enjoy Bleachers/Jack Antonoff but I really dON'T enjoy Lena Dunham
Skinny androgynous Italian women, The best combo.
I like the song but the video was way to fucking hipster for me
This is so cool!
so does Jack get beat up in every video???
Is the maid Christie Carlson Romano?
reminds me of La La Land
What is this video? I'm intrigued and confused all at the same time!
Bleach - don't take the Febreeze
I love the video, Lena! Much better than the music sorry
Lena Dunham directed this right!? freaking sweet! didn't she rape her sister? cool. enjoy your pedo pop
someone do an indepth analysis of this video stat
Oml I love Alia Shawkat also search party was great definitely needs a second season 😂👌🏼
Am I the only person who hears "don't take tu madre"? 😂
I can't tell if I'm supposed to be horrified or be amazed by the "artistic" video that I just witnessed
This is gay af it's so gross
Lena Dunham is a child molester look it up. do not support these people.
I'm liking this guy. Want more pls.
My dick is confused on those two people sitting on the thumbnail they look like girls but my dick senses something is wrong...

We love Utah.  Just beautiful. So want to see all of it. Bob seema like a great guy. My DannyO would like him. They could be bros. lol. Ty kidO. What a great life. I want!!  Lol. 👍🏼😜❤️
those roads look just like the roads Thelma and Louise drove on in the end of their movie before they dove off the cliff.
I  totally understand your addiction Bob. I am Totally addicted to Diet Coke
just subscribed, Love how you explain things. Love your videos.
AWESOME video! Love the drone shots with music!!! Thx for sharing!
Carolyn, do you happen to know if there's going to be any more RTRs?
It is so stunning. I wonder if you could mention what the temperature is in some of these videos.
You and Bob make a great team,  to of the most kind hearted people out there!
Man that place is beautiful
I too am addicted to diet Pepsi.... It increases IQ. 😀
I'm addicted to diet Pepsi to Bob
The flowers are edible.  At this stage you can cut them up and use in a stir fry.  The leaves, when beaten and stripped can be twisted and braided to make rope.  Very useful plant.  What a great area.
ps diet coke can give strokes  got to stop it bob we don't want to lose you
fab scenery Carolyn great to nave bob there to
Glad to see you have met Bob.  Been watching him for years (and others).
Breath taking just beautiful.
I wonder if Bob will get an RV
Hi Carolyn,I was at that same spot over 40 years ago and it was infested with rattlesnake,please keep an eye on the pets.Tom
Yukka plants  can't bloom until they are 20 years old. I hope you go back and see it.
thanks.....freaking awesome
love you and your travels.........................and that camp is beautiful,  I would have to stay there for awhile
wow I can see again. Thanks for taking down the dream catcher.
Pepsi is one of the companies that pulled their You Tube ads
Glad you & Bob are collaborating! Both of you do excellent "RV/Nomad Life" coverage.
The scenery is beautiful.  I am getting high, just watching.  Oh, hey Bob, yes you can compete with Matilda. In fact, the two of you are doubly beautiful as you are beautiful on the inside as well as the outside.
Great to see Bob on your channel.  I love the valley of the gods.  Stay safe, have fun.
Amazing view and so appreciate you and Bob for sharing your experiences with us!!!
What forces cause those peaks?  Water or erosion?  Is that sedimentary rock?  Look at those rocks that simply tumbled down off that one peak!
that Bob is a workaholic :)
fantastic view from the Drone I sure enjoyed watching your videos and Bob is a cool guy
ah. ...I love Bluff. ...Valley of the Gods Rocks!
Do rattlesnakes become a problem in that area?
That area is magnificent! how come that it is not full of campers in RV ? Thanks for sharing.
wow beautiful place to boondock. What's the temperature during the day and night.
Yucca is pronounced YOUKA
Utah has a special beauty. Valley of the Gods is on my list. Safe travels to you and Bob.
Beautiful its on my list why do they call it valley of the Gods ?
What beautiful land! Glad to you and Bob hanging out. You two are quite funny together. ~db
hi Carolyn hi Capone :-) beautiful scenery and it's nice you have Bob to hang out with when you feel like company!
Are you not afraid of the dog finding a snake.....love you videos
love the use of yucca plants they are very wonderful source for natural healing  loved the vid Carolyn as always
Yes. Very true. LOL!
I expected to see John Wayne cantering up behind you.
Love love love the drone shots and really enjoyed the music at the end. I mean the music was perfect!
Thank you. You are Awesome
It's nice to see you and Bob! This makes it more real.
So insanely gorgeous.  I'm so jealous.   I want your lives !! Lol.  I'll get there.  Baby steps
I have fond memories of Bluff Utah. Car broke down on the way to Lake Powell. Tow truck driver gave us a history lesson about the area. Nice people.
Haven't heard you mention rattlesnakes.  Have you or the dogs encountered any?  And if so what did you do?
Great vlog. That's some barren but beautiful land!
I like it when bobs there.. he's such a nice guy and so are you!!
Like castles and fortresses.....beautiful!
Love It! I have just a few more years until retirement from teaching and can't wait to get on the road!
Hats! Where are your hats. And sunscreen. Sunscreen is best anti-ageing cream. Every summer my skin gets better. 
I was in that area early in April. But with transmission prob w the jeep I had to head home.
Hi Bob!  What a beautiful place.  I haven't been there since I was a child.  We are going back soon.
Beautiful video!
Wow!! What a Beautiful part of the country to see. Love the drone views. Thank You Carolyn, Bob & Capone, much appreciated.
Looked like bird doo on that windshield.  I believe you've been the victim of a fly-by shooting.
Pretty country.  Enjoy!
Spectacular video. Amazing footage with the drone.
Are there scorpions and tarantulas on this beautiful landscape?
Beautiful spot, great company,,,,,I'd call that RV Heaven!
It's great to see Bob on the other side of the camera. He is so quick witted and funny! Great stuff you guys! Thanks.
Looks like some cheap rv living to me.  Love it!  Carpe Diem
Is the drone hard to fly?
was there last August. definitely check the forecast in the late summer because if it rains your stuck on those backroads unless you have a 4x4.
Hi Bob!  How cool.  Always fun to see  y'all together.  Diet Pepsii?  No kidding.  Hi Capone!  What a great spot.  Hi Bob! Always enjoy your videos Carolyn. Thanks so much. 😀👍
Is the road into monument valley in and turn around to get out or does it go clear through?  Beautiful place!
Looks like a scene from an old John Wayne movie
I really enjoyed your video. I would like to thank you for making it with Bob in it.
that's gorgeous! I need to go there!
It is so nice to see all the places I would love to go but can't through the eyes of your camera! Thank you. It is so much more personal and real than a documentary or just pictures!!
I like watching and listening to you guys together.   Two very down to earth, good hearted people. Thank you so much for the views.

funny video, great car. (fyi: diverter is pronounced dih-vurt-er)
if she needs some help cleaning her pants let me know
Airbags are for pussies
How to plant flower seeds ?
That's why you don't buy a Chevy
all the people saying its too loud, *grow a pair you fucking snowflakes*
Hot damn that is fuckin nuts.
Way to ruin a car. Smh
All this work on an automatic?
nick your video has made his way to greec articles :P  http://newscar.gr/video/o-ichos-tis-eksatmisis-anoigei-tous-aerosakous-video/
automatic is cool.... said no one ever.....
I probably have to clear a code hahaha lol 😁 😁
Sounds nice! Horrible comments, and it seems like most people dont know what to make of a drag car.......
tgeres no point having an exhaust that loud tbh plus it ain't even manual its automatic lame asf 👎
SUBSCRIBED!!
LOOKS LIKE A TRACTOR
Above is the only reason why airbags should be deployed, stay safe guys, stay frosty.
Oh God!! people are so stupid!! its not about loud exhaust , he must fucked up smh with seatbelt when installing new seats!! seatbelt tensioners in eng i believe...
Bro! That was F@¢king AWESOME!!!!!
Rackin up some serious views buddy. good for you!
How can I find that online men ?
lol omg why does it sound like that??? it sounds like a race car 😎😏
Sounds like shit
all these mods and the car is automatic? that just broke my heart.
So you have a supercharged car that forces normal exhaust flow to make a 90 degree bend, holy backpressure!
What a genius invention. Basically like running straight pipes. Or when the cops are around just close it up.. Sounds like a nascar
The girl is so hot and cute.
I hate automatic cars! They sound shit, makes driving shit everything is shit. And they're very expensive to fix opposed to manual
that sounds like a Ford motor.  my 90 5.0 topped out at 140 with 3 of us each weighing about 190lbs.  it was stock minus flowmaster exhaust.  no air bags deployed, sup
https://www.booster.com/just-a-young-mexican-trying-to-make-it
Holy shit. Electronic cutout fail at its best.
Who puts in a roll cage, builds a 'racecar', but leaves the air bags ...
One of the best videos I've seen to date. Holy fuck!
10:38 Are they farting?
Don't forget to tell your insurance company if you've disabled your air bags.
Well I guess that means the noise is at a fine level.
Louder but not faster??? Pretty corny
going through residential areas with the diverter on, you deserve to be slapped like the fucking cunt you are. i mean nothing against the diverter but have some respect for your neighbours man.
hahaha love this! I'm glad you're safe but I feel this is your reward for being loud and obnoxious
lol shit american cars
that was bananas
Exhaust shpuldnt make airbags blow
0:11 when you think you can let out a fart but you poop your PANTS
"I can't see anything..., let's take our seat belts off" -Anonymous grave carving
Adjusting an exhaust to sound louder so the car can look more powerful is like installing lion's roar on a cat to show she is dangerous! :))
why the ear rape.... pathetic really
All good, but why AUTOMATIC??? Ruins the whole car...
10:44 should have been the thumbnail. Nice Video!!!
Hells not holy. Stop saying it. " Thats pretty Funny"
Why didn't you call chevy for help instead of cutting it yourself.
Look at her face (she's like WFT am I doing here? Yeah, right I was waiting for his rich ass father to die...)
I am not sure your exhaust triggered the airbags. Fluke deal.Glad you guys didn't get hurt.
Why would you get a piece o shit manual camaro?
I doubt it was because of your exhaust, infact if you knew anything about airbags you'd change the title to- 'I'm so dumb my airbags went off cause the suspension is so hard after hitting a bump at 140'
Thought I'd share if it hadn't been done yet...sorry if it has! http://www.thedrive.com/watch-this/9920/this-chevy-camaro-zl1s-exhaust-was-so-loud-it-set-off-the-airbags
Brought to you by Takata
Does it not adjust the cam timing for idle? Sounds really rough. You'd think with the technology available you could still make it run smooth at idle instead of that old carburetor sound.
I never had a fucking brain so i dont know... fucking idiots
What I learned from this video is that airbags are very dangerous.
Is that his new camaro?
Fake as can be the airbags on the dash and steering wheel would have gone off as well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This guy must have a really small schlong to have a car like this. AND ITS NOT EVEN A MANUAL WTF??
your famous on msn now lol http://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/enthusiasts/this-camaro-zl1s-exhaust-system-is-so-loud-the-airbags-blow/ar-BBAEoQe
the explosion happened at 10:19 thank me later enjoy.
The reason why not to buy a non CPO American sports(race?) car
something tells me warranty wont cover this
Have fun with your permanent hearing loss.
THATS A CHEVY 4 YOU!!!  PLEASE  TRADE IN 4 A MUSTANG !!!!   THAT WONT HAPPEN .. SORRY BUDDY....
What kind of car is that again?
*_what a beautiful Chrysler 300c SRT8 at _**_13:26_**_ shame to see it in that condition tho_*
you probably cooked the sensor with heat
The car shook before the airbags went off.  He hit a bump first...
Whatever became of the Jeep. I must have missed the episode
good thing it has a switch and isnt that loud all the timr
the people that drive around with these loud ass exhausts need to be be knocked out. this could not have happened to a more deserving of a person. too bad you did not drive it over a cliff with you in it.
Sergeant Speed, a manual transmission is not ideal for drag when you can't use a manual transmission...
Makes me laugh to hear you talk so proudly about your automatic car that got tuned by your friends... Why don't you ask them to put a flower sticker on the hood? It would suit you really well girl!!
It might help if you put 2 1/2 foot of straight pipe on it.
your exhaust didn't set it off.
loud and louder.
watched just so it would stop popping up fk me running
What a CUNT!
I think I'll just keep my airbags and also my life and not put obnoxiously retarded sounded loud exhaust pipes in my car
put a bird on it!
The dream of the 90's is still alive in Portland... Portland... Portland...
What does "hipster" even mean?  People use the word so loosely it's impossible to know.  Please stop using that dumb ass word.
Does this me I can write off my beer tab???

I love Scotty's videos but my favorite part is when he (or Todd) roll the credits xD

I want my house to become a petting zoo 😭.
Not kidding. Every time I watch your videos my dog starts barking like crazy

Yay for an ad at the beginning of Scotty's vlog!
I had headphones in and the beginning killed my ears
Okay so, right before I watched this, I was thinking that it was only a matter of time before Jay started vlogging now that he's a part of the group and then there's literally a bit about Jay vlogging!! Mind = Blown 😱
Hello everybody and welcome to my vlog
Stage coach is a coach company in England...

ANY SATSANGI SUBSCRIBE HERE FOR SHABADS AND SATSANGS VIDEOS
Casey: "I gotta go to Finland" Oscar: "No way, again?"  OSCAR, YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID "NOR-WAY, AGAIN??" missed that one big time.
This is episode 21
O am so jaelous. I am flying to NYC this month (finnaly the day has come!!!) and have to sit in a very narrow seat for 7 hours:( I wish all seats were businessclass...
The quality of these vlogs are really much much better. The whole segment of that guy who was playing drums on the street was amazing.
hey Casey can I have your pennyboard
Make a video of you working
Fuck you casey don't ever yell at arson ride Fuck you peace of shit arson ride is better than anyone
I always knew oscar smoked
Casey's passport's thickness is goals.
i love your tool's room alottttt!!!! it's definitely was all men's dream~
searious question: do you like finland? and would you like to livi in finland? would you like to learn finnish?  PLEASE LIKE THIS SO HE CAN SEE THIS❤
I find the part at 7:00 so hilarious for some reason.  Speed it up to 2x!!!
Damn your episodes are such high quality, really nice editing Casey!
I MUST HAVE WATCHED THAT PART WHERE CASEY HIT HIS FUNNY BONE ON THE PLANE LIKE 10 TIMES XD IT WAS AWESOME. Sorry Casey but that was GOLD
7:02 "son of a b****" i know that shit hurts but it was funny haha. I love u Casey.
Casey, you fly all the time.  How come I never see you fly DELTA???
Oscar is such a great guy. Glad Casey has this platform so creators behind the scenes can get as much love as the talent.
What's the deal with the tennis shoes over the wires at 0:37?
Contrary to Casey's own words on the subject, the bit where he whacked his humerus is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
Some travel with a Boosted board, others travel with 12ft board. ;-)
hi casey. im your fan.i want to take a photo with you. you are amazing
Brand of his sneakers please?
Your cuticles hurt my feelings.
Casey, you are a savage. How you run around like a wild man, get shit done AND film the way you do is absolutely incredible. Great episode. Congrats Oscar!!
Casey riding his skateboard around NYC is like Spider-man spinning his web around NYC. Hope to see him one day when I come to New York
Sorry bout your funny bone, just a nerve you hit Casey but your reactions was hilarious. Be safe
I'm from Finland 😊😊
I met that kid he lives in au he's on a holiday
Am I the only one who was staring at the LG OLED W ?
Casey looks like you got the LG OLED TV W also like you're friend MKBHD.
Well... what happened again?
Bucket drummer... highlight of the video!
4:53 anyone else see that giant ass TV?!
Does this guy know everyone in NY city
Died when he hit his funny bone
surprised the video wasn't demonitized for the use of shit
HELMET!!  Not only might you hurt yourself but then what would 7M+ subscribers do without your vids!  C'mon!!!!!
What shoes is Casey wearing he also has them on in the Amsterdam video ⛸⛸
That LG OLED W 😍
MUITO LEGAL SEUS VIDEOS VERY GOOD YOUR VIDEOS
Plz go back to no swearing. Great stuff still. Thank you 🙇
I need water
It's a Belgian chef who cooks for this airline hehe!
This is my first time ever watching Casey Neistat. Can someone please explain his life to me?? How is this possibly a real life
did people see that oacer smoke
Casey you are A-W-S-O-M
Just casually skateboarding through an airport hahahaha nice one Casey
When Oscar said "No way, again?"...he meant, "why didnt you invite me?"
The fact that he literally is NEVER on time for absolutely anything he EVER does, mostly without reason other than sub-par organizational skills and procrastination, *irritates me to no end*.
what watch is that casey!? garmin fenix?
Welkom to Amsterdam
I want your glasses ...buddy
I have that penny board👌
Congratulations Oscar .... and quit smoking 🚭
Casey has officially reached spider-man status.
since when does Oscar smoke
This was one of the most exciting vlog i've seen in a while!
Casey is like the guy from GTA who go around the city and meet everyone lol
Oscar is such a humble n cool guy. When Casey showed up he tried to hide his cigarette 👍🏻
I didn't know oscar smart kes
guy looks like Mike Patton's brother (Oscar does)
im from finland
Let's just all appreciate this small but such an amazing edit at 1:20 👌❤️ p.s. check out my vlog!
welcome to finland!
262 Washington st is his address
Casey needs a PA
I'm not as good at consistently watching the new vlogs as I was the old, but I love how much effort goes into making every shot.
I need this intro music, please someone HELP ME!!!
1:00 WHAT ARE THOOOOOOSE?!
How do you manage to skate around the airport but when I try to skate around and outdoor mall the mall cops always get onto me?
I absolutely went back to see Casey smashing his arm against the door 😂😂😂
After he shakes the cops hand, says goodbye to his friend and scoots off down the road on his boosted board is like a Woody Allen scene, it just looked so good .. so NY & so Casey .. Just Brilliant.
Oscar that is a total babe outfit. Love the bomber with the turtle neck
ohh that's nothing....i'm going to my mailbox and back
Hahaha I laughed so hard right on the funny bone .... not funny .. 🤣
GODDAMN I didn't watch this until today, could have come to see the speech, its right around the corner from me
is he riding a penny or a penny nickel board
OLD COW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Foreign policy 101: Be nice, not an arse, and remember what happened.
She wants to win this election on fear. So far all the Brussels rumours are playing into her hands in that respect. She is fanning the flames..
don't accept some poison coffee lol
Build the wall!!!
She has the official highest approval rating of any P.M for decades .This will be borne out in the election.
Farage has been trying to dictate to her how nasty the EU are and will be for months..she is starting to see it at last..
Looks more like it's the reverse so far...
She has such a punchable face!!
one swift boot into the drink is all it would take
never was a Tory voter but she's the only one who will get us out of the EU....
Shit leader
she is not good. her choices are not helping the people
She's a snob and a cuck but at least she isn't a bloody communist, unlike Corbyn.
I doubt she drank that coffee
Juncker has resorted to Terror, blackmailing the PM and country demanding masses of money, he is using Terror tactics against us, we will become their prisoners.
FUCK JUNKER! FUCK THE EU!
Great. Do not bow to any of those EU corporatocrats.  Down with the EU.
Many countries in the eu buy more stuff from us than we do them. Plus we are the 6th wealthiest country in the world, it would economic suicide for the EU to keep the UK out the free market.
bloody BBC propaganda fuck the cons...
But why want they left the EU. I mean it brings a lot of advantages with it
lol I know fuck all about politics why am I even here
Such a hag.
Theresa May is totally deluded, negotiations with the EU bureaucrats is a complete fantasy. They will be the only ones calling the shots, the EU is an autocracy and will make an example out of the UK.
Fuck the spineless Labour lefties, the EU and fuck the BBC!
All this bullshit talk to score election points, and people will actually believe it! They will vote in this dictator and will suffer for it.
May is completely delusional she has no clue what she is even saying she's just a walking contradiction. How people are supporting this is insane.
Not voting conservatives again...not for Tis lady & for Jeremy Hunt 2 b Minister of  Health to torture medical staff's with his ridiculous policies.
Treason May is Completely Clueless !!!
The Brussels Mafia can intimidate any country that seeks independence but their time is coming to an end. Bring on the collapse of the EU!
The only thing that would be bloody difficult is May and Co. realizing how shit of a bargaining position they have in negotiations. Denial and delusion can indeed end in blood.
The UK deserves some positive news...
I hope Theresa May ties a strong and sturdy anchor to her leg and jumps into the English Channel.
Vote Liberal Democrats
Ha ha ha so now they want and want from the European Union, don`t give them shit since they want out they should have a huge cero from Europe, I forgot they don`t need the Europeans so whats the problem?
Doesn't care about Scotland or N.Ireland how can we trust her.
Haha that's Mevagissy I can see the house I stayed in on holiday
It's that lefty Marxist BBC interviewer again! The BBC love a good leftie staff member, that's why they employ from the Guardian.
May is completely delusional, i don't understand why this Country cannot see what a shit Prime Minister she is.. i didn't vote Labour in the last election but i'm voting Labour this time round
Britain must pay EU Brussel money back or Britain is criminal.
She's out of her mind... Eugh creep....
Ugh her or Corbin ...
theresa may seems to find telling the truth "bloody difficult"
Bloody useless woman.
this woman is a joke
House prices 😂 come to London love you'll know about problems with house prices then
Theresa may the female Freemadson. She is weak. Pathetic smelly breath sloth
How people's memory is short. Britian went to war for Poland and then helped save Europe. This bankrupted Britian and this is how they treat us
How people's memory is short. Britian went to war for Poland and then helped save Europe. This bankrupted Britian and this is how they treat us
I love the way the press and Tories are trying to demonise the EU... it's business, what did you expect? Grow up.
give the germans a bill for bombing fuck out of us in ww 2
strong and stable my arse
she is so stupid
Hopefully in the next 5-10 years the European Union will have collapsed
Get this lunatic out. We have a chance so take it.  Shout it from the roof tops.  For the sake of the NHS, house, jobs, taxing the corps please vote.  Get them out.  They created this whole mess.
Laura kuenssberg is the most annoying little t - - t on tv, no sorry, second to that little scotch git. Ms K should not be given air time, she should go away crawl into a hole and hibernate for a couple of years.
ugly witch of oz
Theresa May is deluded
EVERYONE REGISTER AND VOTE THIS SHIT IS GETTING OUT OF HAND
out means out Junker not half in we the british have spoken the eu owes us money
She has her head so far up Trumps ass
Why is she only focusing on brexit? I wouldn't want to vote for her What about citizens?  Unemployment? Education? NHS? crime?
Theresa May for PM!!!
Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, so cherry picking bits up front means only so much.
Oi nah no one vote conservative, vote Labour, or even UKIP I don't care who just NOT conservative.
Give them hell Theresa May! Time to cut loose from the EU now.
Give Scotland its independence first, you "bloody difficult woman" .
Fuck off BBC & preach to your beloved 72 genders while real people see through your retarded lefty bullshit.
Can Britian take back control of own country? - No they can´t! Brussel Europe and Juncker must help - like always in the past!
Well that's just what we need isn't it? - an arrogant spoilt child who will stamp her feet and piss off the EU negotiators, getting us the worst deal for the UK.
The fact that Junker walked away with the hump is good news, Mrs M obviously stood her ground!
I have to admit Mithey made this map brilliantly!! I hope you guys enjoy it!!

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the all went bankrupt from replacing so many broken tables
*Believer starts playing* AH LU DA SOOOONG
it's like 12:30 am and i laughed so hard and so loud!
Kissingggggggg
From 1:50 to 2:07 when Josh is talking, you can tell Jason is trying so hard to fit in with the young people. xD
Is Alex and Karina dating know
Bro...U know ma boi Alex legit wants to smash!
if alex was actually gay boy i'd wish to be a guy
Too shakey and hyper for me.

Jason literally threw cockroaches  😷
alex looks so happy
Alex is so cute
I don't care what anybody says but I love Scotty. He's so funny. 😎

Play the David Dobrik Character quiz at https://www.sporcle.com/games/Schwazyjets/david-dobrik-quiz    PLEASE GET THIS LINK TO DAVID!!
"You know I suck better dick than you .... what? Why'd you say that"  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
First things first imma say all these words inside my head
when Liza came out I lost my shit
That ending 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was watching this and at the same time Drake and Josh started on Nick and it was just so weird to think that That fatty teenager playing videogames was Josh 😂
HE PUT BELIEVER AT THE END! I WAS NOT READY! I AM SHAKEN!
i never understand what the fuck is happening in these videos and i love it
NOT ENOUGH ALEX
THE INTO. THTS MEEE
When the table fell from alex thinking. I'm screaming
ALEX IS MINE DYDIWGFNDJB
Alex looks like Casey simpson
Jason's pants were covered in the blue stuff and then Liza came out with it on her face and i screamed
Thought Alex hated Corrine
Not the first time Jason has been covered in roaches!!!
Tell me why I have the same exact shirt as Brian😂
that momment when you're eating dinner and you look down and you're like... yep i still have a big penis..
Alex and Corinne make a super cute couple
Damn Josh Peck is so damn HOT 😍
the blue face bit was amazing
the blue face bit was amazing
i lost it on the "no mistakes" bob ross shirt ... Fuck   XD
omg why is zane so right at the end :`D im laughing so hard !!!
What is that outro song tho
im literally scotty lmao
The kiss in the video isn't the same as in the thumbnail..
scotts adorable when he smiles 😂❤
does anyone else think alex is smokin
That's how they react with cockroaches. Liza with the trenchula was calmer XD
"Focus Alex" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Scott will die last out of all of them
I laughed so hard when Alex destroyed the table with the force of his mind 😂
The way he says liza at the end tho💖😍
okay dom remind me of Alex(13reasons why),anyone else?
Alex sucked the life source out of corenna
My favourite part was at 1:09 when that green fucker started massacring the trailers.
i never realized how much train violence is in this show
When the hero doesn't save the lady tied to the tracks: 2:21
DISCLAMER:  Not for kids
these scenes usd to scare the shit out of me when I was little
Someone should check out that bridge
Thomas The Tank Engine DEATH Compilation would of been a better title. These vehicles are sentient and feel pain.
goddamn pery is straight savage!
I don't know why but these accidents always were the best part of that TV series. I was laughing at it as a kid, and I'm laughing at it even now...
god fucking dammit Percy
I love this song!
I can't quite grasp how these scenes were made. The special effects look really realistic, as if they were life sized. can someone explain please
2:53 Michael Bay's short stint as stunt coordinator on thomas the tank engine was definitely the highlight of his career.
The best one was in Ant-man.
thomas the tank engine was the shit
So many dead inanimate objects
WHO WAS FROM NERDCUBED
Five years later, this is still the best video on YouTube.
let the finger hit the mute
thomas did all his own stunts. he such a bosstrain
This is so fucking metal
Oh my god that was kinda scary but the music is owned by Drowning Pool.
Percy is a sadistic killer!
Wtf did I just witness
Just by watching this it seems the green train is a murderer
I like the song
What type of Thomas episode did you use, when Skarloey crashed into the coal?
what cruel god would give a train a face
the song playing is called Drowning Pool - Bodies
Can't believe they're CGI now.
did i just witness trains die?
Remember that in this world any inanimate object could be alive.
did you know that Thomas and friends was robotics toy
I wish I had a play city like that
Definitely not a robot
For such a relatively small island, Sodor sure did have a lot of accidents :D
Now this is what i call FUCKING MENTAL!!!!!! Jesus christ i didn't think screamo went with kids shows..... Not bad ;)
poor trains
My God... I didn't realize how brutal this show was lol. Crashes like these make front line news
Damn. I don't remember Thomas the Tank engine being this damn brutal.
this is the best video on youtube
You're childhood summed up in 3 minutes if you watched Thomas the Train :)
what was the that last one from?
2:20 oh god is that train blood?
FIST ME THOMAS
How funny would it be if someone put Cleveland's "no no no no no no no NOOOOOO!" when ol' Cranky Bugs was falling:D
Oh the memories.. ohhh.... ;-;
I dont remember this show being this violent, lol
1:10 Percy the mass-murderer holy fuck.
+nimrodyahal You might want to use headphones on this one.
I'm surprised no one hasn't complained about this they complain about any other small thing. I do love the crash scenes in Thomas
This is an amazing example of white people with way too much money
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.

Second To Gboriwole!!!!!
First to Gboriwole.. #
I'm surprised I haven't seen a joke on here about them being in the school of rock....
gez I thought I wasn't going to like this cause charlie is my bae. but wow Aaron is filling the spot great!
I was really expecting a clean-fest the entire time but Aaron pulled it off. Now we wait until we see how he performs live to see if he can keep it up.
He could scream all along? Lol
I might actually start to like OM&M again after this.
Jamie's Elsewhere 2.0 Let's GOOOO!!!
We miss Austin's screams part. :(
I never knew Aaron can scream so good :) OM&M is really Unbreakable even without Austin
honestly I couldn't get into restoring force and cold world, I still missed shayley. However this is amazing and am glad to see they are srill jamming!!
Just saw them two days ago and they killed with him as frontman. One of the best bands of the entire two day festival
I can hear they are stepping away from the Metalcore genre a little and letting the other guitars be heard with other sounds rather than a monotone stamp
I love the wording, smarter word choices too \m/
Long hair Yes!!!!!
Saw this live it was rad!
Liked the video before watching... heh
Wtf is this shit
Did anyone look at the lyrics and think their talking about the band itself
Where the fuck is Austin?
Aaron really stepped up. Good shit. 👍🏻
I will never be able to get over Aaron Pauley's fat head... even if he tries to hid it with his long hair.
OMG THIS IS AMAZING, I AM SHOOK.
Well this is.... different.
Why don't i hate this?
This song and House vs Hurricane's new song are the shiiiit!
instantly better than the whole newest album
The Fallout: New Vegas 2 music trailer looks so tight.
after listening to Jamies Elsewhere I fuckin knew if Austin ever left Aaron could take over easily. I love both of them but Aaron is a badass!
They sound like every other metalcore band with generic lyrics nothing special without Austin
I love it and I love how they didn't get a new singer just moved people around . in this case it worked out well .
just found out this band by accident... it is amazing!!!
Miss Austin, but Jack Black's Son fits great.
it's just not the same without Shayley's clean vocals. I remember that's what got me into OM&M. But still a great band...I'm just nostalgic
I'm still sad that Austin left but Aaron does a great job in his place, great song
Yes Aaron!! YES THIS BAND HAS STILL GOT IT!! Man, it hurts not seeing Austin but fucking hell this band is still going strong!
This song sounds like 2011 musically. And while I've never really been a HUUUGE fan of OMAM, this kinda sold me. I love this!
FUCKING KILLER! Good job guys well done!
Wow they're so original. Completely ripping Attack Attack - Stick Stickly's video location.
The new Jamie's Elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, I still miss Austin, but it's nice to see Arron be the frontman again. His screaming got way better.  Just know Arrons got this.
I miss Austin so f*cking much!!
Not going to lie Aaron looks like a younger Jack Black
and I thought om&m was over,I thought wrong. pretty damn good Aaron.
I'm amazed even if Austin isn't there, Aaron is good at screamo and the song sounds so good 😙 i like it so much 😮💖
damn I got goosebumps when the breakdown hit. way better than when they had Jerry rouch fill in Austin's place.
This is my fucking theme song😂
I dunno what's going on i just noticed that austin is gone...what happened?
Lets just hope any new singles and albums go back to the hard sound of the Self titled album and The Flood.
I love Austin but the new of. ice an men is fucking great love it
they look like slayer now
Still doesn't beat their first album. lol
Love this song
Wait, is there another new vocalist? I'm confused.
i was steering away from listening to anything new from of miceNmen but im glad i stopped by , sounds killer lads
The part where she looks at the girl's photograph reminds me of LP's Lost in the Echo video
To anybody saying they didn't know Aaron could scream this well, Jesus. Go listen to Jamie's Elsewhere and listen to everything you've missed.
I miss seeing Austin already
Is it just me or the screams kinda sound like Beartooth...?
Raw, but still < Jaime's Elsewhere .
My heart is hurting bc no Austin but at the same time is very happy because they don't sound bad at all. I hope my favorite band doesn't change too much ❤️
This song live was so fucking lit!
A long ass fuckin' time ago, In a town called Kickapoo, There lived a humble family Religious through and through xD
You guys did amazing and I'm excited to see what else is coming. ❤ Hurts without Austin but you guys are still rocking.
Always scary when a lead singer leaves. But by the gods we have been blessed with one of the most glorious reincarnation. Aaron you fucking kill it dude.
I didn't know Jack Black is the new OM&M's singer
Since the departure of Austin, Aaron was forced to fill the spot, and he just stunned me ! Never thought of him being so good at replacing Austin and filling his previous spot as well !
great decision to continue the band, so proud of y'all. this reminds me when Adam Gontier left 3DG
still not the same though
Austin should be proud. god DAMN, Aaron!
Who still listens to aaron's old songs from jamie's elsewhere
Never been a huge fan of the band but holy fucking shit, Aaron delivered. Way to rise up.
finally a bassist is noticed for once. they're better than ever now.
1.1 Million already??? How???
usually when a band loses their original frontman, they take a dive pretty bad.   this is one of the very, very few instances where the new font man is just as good, if not better then the old one. bravo
these guys are good i guess
I CANT STOP LISTENING TO THIS!
missing austin but this isnt half bad
I got a boner.
Can someone bring me up to speed? What's this of Austin leaving? When did he leave and what is he up to now?
Austin who?  seems Aaron has got this!  sucks Austin is gone tho....
what happened to austin?
1 Million Views In a Week? Thats Awesome!
Great, now can I get my fucking Kingdom Hearts 3 already?

Why is dj khaled so ugly
BEST SONG/VIDEO OF THE YEAR
Why Justin looks like Eminem xD? WTF?!

Who is the girl on the horse tho
Who is the girl on the horse tho
i only like lil waynes singing and chance the rapper
They Killed it
justin beaver - sang 70% of the song chance the rapper - sang 9% of the song quavo - sang 10% of the song lil wayne - sang 10% of the song dj khaled - 1%
As usual Lil' Wayne's verse had literally nothing to do with the song
Who is here before 100 million
If Eminem and Ellen DeGeneres ever had a kid....ok i know that's not gonna happen but its gonna look like Justin Bieber
Subcribe My CHannel and i do back !
Do you ever see a comment and think damn I should've said that........
autotune overload
The only reason for the fame of this song is justin beiber
In the back u just see wayne smoking that good good
In the back u just see wayne smoking that good good
And all BLehsssiNGss
That moment when your ad is the song itself...
This shit would slap if gay ass Justin wasn't in it
I can't, Jutin is so beautiful <3
Lil Wayne sounds like he's high on helium!!!!! XD lol
this song is so lit
3.15  where my boobies at ?😮 😂😂
I'm very amused at what this music video is about. For fuck's sakes stop with the damn butt and boob shots for fucking once dammit. I'm talking about the video alone
4:31 nip slip
the rich get richer and the poor stay poor
Chance and Justin look so good in this
love this song
Looks JB goin' thru his Slim Shady phase😂😂
oh damn is that the real slim shady?
nip slip at 4:30
At 2:10 This nigga looked at his jacket😂😂😂
people I want u all to listen to my sing they never recognise me
weezy back at it again with the auto tune
did that girl in the beginning have barbie feet? am i the only one??
Nip slip 4:31 just sayin
1:54 Why is his belt censored??
please everyone that is watching this subscribe to Suarez gaming with cristiano Ronald picture please
If you got clout, you will eventually go through Khaled, its like he is a walking connection, one song with Khaled and you might be know by half of the world in a night
DJ Khalid like a Pokemon he can only say his own name
low key doe you should of got chris brown in here
sub to my channel and i will sub you back instantly
tbh If Fetty Wap was in this, it would be fire🔥
Check out "Critic - On My Way" the video is ridiculous, inspired by lil wayne
i just noticed that fouseytube bases himself off of DJ Khaled hmm
That moment lil wayne get on the hook and i gotta hit mute!!😩😫
That moment lil wayne get on the hook and i gotta hit mute!!😩😫
DJ Khaled looks exactly like Cartman from south park
still like quavo verse JB cool but this the Migos year
i've missed him like if you agree
justin is so sexy  havent heard him for a bit
JB is killlin it!!!! He's on fireeee I loveeeee
did JB just silently, yet loudly signal that he's blood affiliated?
poor old dude he was one of our oldest streamers
keemstar feeling ashamed? WOW the gods truly are watching out for that old elderly guy :)
2:50 he tried to play it off
U fuck..u put PewDiePie in ur title for more views
RESPECT UR ELDERS
What the fuck why is every comment liked by me
Anything to get pewdiepie in the title, ehn?
at least keem apologized, the media wouldnt do that.
OMFG I SWEAR TO GOD I HAVE LIKED ALL OF THE COMMENTS WTF LOL LIKE EVERY COMMENT HAS MY LIKE ON IT WHAT THE FK IS GOING ON
You've uploaded this before...
5:11 u dont feel ashamed u.........U my friend..U need to DIE!!! 😡😡
I puked when I saw Keemstar.
Wow that douchebag at the end really fucked up and was still worrying about his video "doing well".... Seriously guy? Man that kid was a piece of shit
Guess I live under a rock
I feel bad for the man that was blammed for that
faze rug is such a little pussy ass
Well, fuck me, i got trapped by clickbait
The tmartn one was the boys trading his wins from the flip a coin thing
Dude I hate people like you in for honor.... have you heard of HONOR? let the people 1v1 and you jump in after your team mate dies...
Had no clue about the first one XD
Man that old man crying made me angry
Man now really! is there anyone who didnt watch porn?
This is bob he can't swim  Don't let him drown in the comment section  Keep him on top     👦🏼    👕    👖 👟👟
At this point I'm not sure if the Pewdiepie one was on purpose or not considering that seems like something he'd do now.
K star is a cunt
There was one when Jacksepticeye was playing Undertale, he didn't edit that out because he wanted the let's play to be long and unedited, still, he should have edited it out and made the video a little longer.
that oldman nearly made me cry😭
This shit is so damn old, and you are saying we are living under a rock
i dont know why but its hard to listen to you
who gives a shit about porn everyone watch it
disliked because of asking for like's before content
Real footage of keemstar not bragging and lying for the first time 100% legit!
wow the clickbait tho. the faze rug thing didnt even have anything to do with brazzers
Pewdiepie watches the good stuff XD
Every coment is about the old guy...even this one
It isnt necrophilia if the body is still warm ;)
Everybody knows the pewdiepie one.its so overused.
the last one is such a bigggg pussy
Game in the background?
At 2:20 in the chat theres some guy whos name is i eat ass and is commenting "nigger faggot won aka tmartn"
is this smike
Saw Brazzers, Clicked the video.
I can't tell if this guy sounds like Troydan Reacts or if it's actually him. Lol
That porn one isn't embarrassing. It's completely natural. Stop being tweeting and just get over it.
quit fucking asking for likes before the video starts. why would we "like" the video before we know if we even like it?
in faze rugs vid i asked myself:What ass🤔
Wait, so he didn't take down the video so it didn't fuck up his views, even though without uploading that video he's still probably making more money than most people from views on his other vids?
Ever think about enunciating when you speak
that last guy was a cunt lol, "b.. but bro, who cares if i showed your girlfriend.. views though"
so a channel based on point out peoples mistakes? lol k no
TrendCrave Are you cutting onions?😵
Keemstar is a fuck up
if its a top 5 and its 10 minutes, thats how you know someone is low on cash
Thebigtalk me too it's so sad ):
Ooh that fucking old man 😭😫😩 I don't cry much but, this, this got me!
Well keem finally realises what he is lol,XD
Oops, missed the name of that pornstar. Let me just rewind, i need to see if she has a 'twitter' and 'tell' her this happened.
Keemstar is a fucking prick he should get Ebola
i hate this game
with pewdiepie who actually cares, the only reason why everyone is on the internet is to watch porn.
I would just re-watch it before anyone else, then I would delete it
stop complaining about PewDiePie it's not like you don't watch porn...
WHERE'S JOE SUGG?!
Damn those bots have no honor.
Faze Rug's a cunt
Why is this shit in my rec
Rug is a fucking bellend
TrendCrave, why you become family friendly.
people in the comments: oh my god how dare pewds watch porn! me: well he was technically the right age back then and still is. stop complaining
Noooo that old guy almost made me cry... thats soooo sad
I'll sub instantly to anyone who will sub to my channel and like this comment.
Poor guy... It's one of the reasons why I've never watched Keemstars stupid shit, cause I doubt most of that shit is actually true...
Stop gaming in your vids
4:50 when was keem not an asshole.
He was watching porn!!!! The first one
In the Netherlands a YouTuber called his girlfriend but he forgotten to edit her number away so she got stalked😂
I hate players like you that got no honour. It's a 1v1 and u start killing him instead of watching and eating some popcorn. And the game's called for honor.
I feel bad for Rug. RUGRATS UNITE
as nobody watches porn :/
kid crying at the end like a bitch
jacksepticeye's video undertale he when he pee he forgot to edite it
4:49 that should be keemstars outro
who cares if yt make mistakes? all of us makes mistakes..
The mistake with pewdiepie isn't a editing mistake bc he was doing a LIVESTREAM  walking dead and then he accidentally showed his browser 
I'm gonna keep hanging out with you guys here in the comments for a while. I like all your suggestions today.

I am thinking of buying a shirt from your shop but I have a question about it: I live in Germany so does it cost more than 30 AUS$? Or is it 30$ for wherever you live?
Shall we go to the park?
Marty and moog are like those kids you have in your high school class that don't really pay attention and don't study but still get very good grades on tests. They are just good at everything they do.
I was wondering, what is the name of this (1:38) background music? It always playing when they fooling around with stuff.
Marty's Mira Build [Part 600] they are still building the freak'n MIRA
i can't wait to see the project 100% done.
build an is200/is300 fuckers
You're chomping at the bits? I'm chomping at the bits! This whole court is chomping at the bits!
shoulda got an e30 bmw build why on earth would you do a crappy mira
https://youtu.be/rnmsp6l1-CY?t=837 - because racecar
mad love for MCM!
the conversation 5 minutes in… lol
what happened to unicorn circuit?
Getting so close! Can't wait to see it all finished.
Episode 50 of Mira - we replace the front rims and tyres  Episode 51 of Mira - we replace the rear rims and tyres
MCM Rocking your screen for years Burn that Rubbah!
This is next level modding for a turd car.
Maybe you guys should weld the center diff, leave the front CV's out and make it a rear wheel drive drift mira?
Go to the five minute mark exactly, close your eyes, and tell me what they sound like they're  talking about.
Marty: the phrase was champing at the bit, but since champing isn't a common word anymore, people began saying chomping. At this point, it is acceptable either way. The more you know
How come you guys didn't use any bracing to keep the shape of the rear?  Shame there was no progress shots at the end where things were bolted up just to see how the tidy up needed to progress too :(
I just realized Moog looks like a 28 year old and a 45 year old at the same time 🤔
The floor swap is insane! you guys are truly inspirational to car guys everywhere.
Get better moog! You sound sick in the video
After slicing my finger the other day on some sharp metal in an old vcr this episode was really hard to watch.
I think you should come to malaysia because here have lot of halfcut mira from japan. find a part here.
Does the Mira AWD rear end fit in my Honda?
RAKE FUCKEN LOVES IT!!
Went through all that and somehow did not do an ls swap and rwd conversion?
Get some overnight parts from japan 🇯🇵
Lol wow your videos aren't struggling at all like the other youtubers
I love the innuendo banter. Moog and Marty, you guys do that so well. :D
Lets play a game: find Moog
did this to my E46, never put anything back and still drive it lmao
Japanese Welding Robot is like DISLIKE!!!!
This is a really cool build. But at the same time i cant help but think that Marty is trying to fill the hole in his heart where the old blue turd used to be.
Chomping at the bit. <- This is a equestrian idiom referring to horses chewing on the piece of gear that goes in there mouth.
Does Rake like it?
make unicorn circuit stickers already!
Are those caps surgically attached to their heads?
You got a awesome hobby yall, Like me! I mean im inspired by yall!
Awesome awesome video!! Such good music and awesome guys
11:36. WCW 😂
Why not just cut and channel original floor?
Awesome video! Marty was mostly right, the saying is "champing at the bit" to refer to a horse on the starting line grinding their teeth on the part of the reins that goes in their mouth.
You know what else is impossible to find? Gen 3 camry's front bumper lips... In canada...
sick chevy!
MCM practices in Roadkill hackary.
Lads, your innuendo's are getting ridiculously boring and tedious, they used to be funny(ish) but now you just go too far with them and make it crap to listen to. Please knock it on the head.... no pun intended!!
Where do you guys find these songs are they your own?
When is Cheryl going to get her new butt?
Mighty Car Gods
OMG, LESS PUNS GUYS, JUST A LITTLE.
Hope there gonna be a poll about what color the car should get :)
2 week and one 16min video? Guys please u more entertaining than that. Make mcmtv3 for bloopers or something.
"It's going to be very time consuming and take a long time."
It's "Chomping at the bit" you pair of ass hats. It's a horse racing reference!
I don't see why they just didn't weld the original pieces back together
Moog's innuendo never gets old.
lol y not use a torch
I LOVE THE MIRA!!! I watched the original episode on TV. Can't wait to see this one done. It'll be nice to see this thing do skids again!!!
When you order deconstructed car at the MCM restaurant
Not my most proud fap, but hey
Hey Marty and Moog i love your show! are you satisfied with your Ryobi power tools? would you recommend buying these? thanks for the answere and keep on doin what you are doin
Marty and Moog, can you make a "chomping at the bits" tshirt?
For added strength why not seam weld the floor in?
Because All wheel Drive.......
The sexual innuendo's here are so strong
Not sure how many times... We should have measured. It's the same all over. Enjoyed your show. Thank you.
Chomping - Marty is correct!
"we probably should've measured it" AHAHAHAHAA
why do you have to chat shit, my Mrs is sat on the other side of the table while I'm listening to you banging on about pushing it into the pink
You guys used to be ok, now its just dick jokes.... sayin that i have never seen any chicks on here like ever.....?!
I bet it's a Barra turbo
Big season loving it
Now.... I want watermelon.... :-(
What's the song at the end?
Mighty Car Mods, or "How many episodes does it take three guys to just swap a floorpan"
Stop using moogs shit music
Marty love Mira's car....and so do I... I hope Marty and Moog will soon finish the Mira Project as well.
This never popped up in my sub box, lads. Just wanted to let you know
you guys need to invest in a plasma cutter would have made this part easy as cutting a piece of pie
I'd really like to see you guys do a Rotor Build :3 RX7's or Cosmo's especially.
Well Well this is good, i just watched it in HD here check it out https://vk.com/wall427155029_4
Doctor strange will be prob. in the movie and he has the time stone...
So I am the only one who thinks The Hulk looks cute in that gladiator avatar
Hela? I believe that I am in...
Dr. Strange is going to be there just so you guys know.  Hehe
Why does the Hulk have bird shit on his shoulder?
help me for my friend tuition https://www.youcaring.com/nemtasyahadati-816114
I didn't know Cate Blanchett was so hot wtf I'm digging the black hair, I want to see more :P
why do they make Thor so weak in these movies? he's freaking THOR!
Marvel did the most impossible thing... got my attention and excited  for a Thor movie
0:20   Sooo, hella is worthy?
But  ... where's Darryl
]G I F T C A R D ]G I V E AWAY https://storage.cloud.google.com/moneymakr/twittergifts.html
I wonder if Yondu there watching in the stands
At 1:15, he looks a bit like Kratos, God of War
This looks awesome! I just hope they don't nerf them and we see Thor and Hulk on the power lvl from their comics. Thor was nerfed AF in TDW and same goes for Hulk in AoU....
i didn't know that Galadriel can destroy the mjolnir.
this is one of the best trailers ever , music n action
So, Hela wants them not to have a dark lord, but to have a queen, not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn... Treacherous as the sea... Stronger than the foundations of the earth...
"He's a friend from work."  Hahahahahaha.
Is it just me or is Hela's smile better than Loki's! (0:17)
I was kinda hoping Strange would make an appearance.
Wow this looks like the GOTG2 trailer on steroids
1:35 thank me later.
Did you learn something, DC?
whats the trILER SONG
too many kids are here in the comments z😂
Retro? Hell yeah!
I am loki super excited for this!
"YEEEEES" Thor what even are you-
I hope Daryl is in this movie.
Inspired by FEMINISTS
Thor: Guardians of the galaxy
Okay, so it has nothing to do with the actual Ragnarok. BUT LED ZEPPELIN HELL YEAH!!
LED ZEPPELIN!!!! HELL YEAH!!!
"YESSSS! WE KNOW EACH OTHER! HE IS A FRIEND FROM WORK!" Lmfao
Did anyone else think at first the chick that stopped Thor's hammer looked like the chick from the underworld movies?
I can't stop watching this trailer, I'm just always grinning ear to ear by the end. this has become my most anticipated movie of 2017
let's go led Zeppelin song!
"...he's a friend from work". And the crowd goes... silent.
what song is playing in the background?
what song is playing in the background?
Is that Sif on the flying creature at 0:47/0:49??
Idris Elba and Cate Blanchett are hot af in this. I'm jizzing. The trailer looks shit though.
what song is playing in the back ground?
This begs the question, will there be a Hulk 2?
Noooo not his hair! :-o
2:20-2:42 the best part of the trailer
is that thanos' girlfriend? :D
Yesyesyestesyesyesyes
I heard a good theory that doctor strange will use the Eye of Agamotto to fix his hammer. Sounds pretty possible to me
am I the only one who noticed thor's sword and sheild disappear in the last fight scene 🤔
Here is what I want to see in the movie: when the Hulk appears, I want a shot of Loki silently saying "Noooooo", then followed by Thor's "YEEEEEEES!"
I keep watching it every day and it's still cool
I think doctor strange put me in a time loop with this trailor.. haha 😂
Jeff Goldblum's character was in the Guardians II credits - who is he?
He's a good Ac-thor
top class trailer:)
Guardians of The Galaxy style...cool
Wonder when this movie takes place
Cate is so sexy ..... Black suits her
U can't recast the Avengers these guys will always be the avengers
SOO AWESOME JUST WAITING FOR THE REALEASE
"Instead of a dark lord you would have a QUEEN!"
Literally one of the 4 movies I am looking forward 2 this year
whats this song name
I saw the movie planet hulk. at last hulk becomes the king of the planet and marries a woman from that planet. to watch the movie, *Amazon prime video*
The trailer look like it was made from the 80'
I feel like Thanos released Hela.
Who's the green gorilla at the end
I'd rather have seen the Wrecking Crew in this one
Hela is op She can legit rip your soul out of your body
Love the music!!
"He's a friend from work"is so good, it would have been even funnier if it wasn't in the trailer and the first time you saw it would be during the movie.
I'm sure out of 53k comments someone has mentioned it, but I love the Kirby artwork from Fantastic Four #64 appearing in this trailer. 1:35
Superheroes aren't cool.
Hela actor is poorly potrayed to the one in the comics , she's not sopoussed to look like a old ugly woman she was atractive enough to even have thor have a child with her
DC IS F*CKED
lolloll i love the last scene!! i didnt realize it was hulk until now

FACKING BABY MAKE CHUKE SAD
She's so scared of Chucky
I heard there were free cheese sandwiches? Mmm Mmm!
I am loving reading about this trainwreck. Absolute Gold!
95% social media, 4.9% partying and saying they are legends, and <1% tents and sandwhiches
Boy were they wrong!
Best marketing team selling crap in the game
What song is in the background?
WOW!!!! just ... wow!!   The best in food, music, and adventure?  How about, the best in fucking up your savings......
man vs wild bear grylls has been in more comfortable experiences for free
annnnnnnd they blew the budget filming and acquiring rights to use the soundtrack for this 'video'.
This is Dash Con 2.0..
From what i gather Fyre festival sounds like burning man without any of the resourceful hippies that are used to living in tents and cheese sandwiches.
haha fuck you trust fund kids!
BWAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
Why is this video even still up?! Sure, you can't scrub it off the Internet. It's gonna get saved and re-uploaded regardless. But at least the views/dislikes won't be that many LOL
Mr Krabs' Krabby Land anyone?
More like Wilson Festival  #outcast
The theme this year was water, but in reality the theme should have been VAPOR.
Wow...I'm not surprised at how much dislikes this video have....
fyre festival: when an american festival goes british
This is funny as fuck. Most Millennials, especially the rich ones are effing retarded.
If anyone is reading this PLEASE HELP i'm still on the island and i really need to poop😂
why are all of the losers mad at people who bought tickets? what is wrong with being rich? would you be laughing if you got scammed out of a shit load of money? hypocrisy
I love how all these rich kids have no common sense xD
I go on trending and see this Fyre Festival bullshit.
It's the hunger games for rich retarded kids
The FEMA festival
"the actual experience exceeds all expectations...." lmao
"Go on take the money and run"
this ad is an instant classic
Yeah i bet it went great lol
The power of a very good Commercial Agency! They can sell you excrement in a high class box!
So, how'd it go?
#1 marketing tool: PUSSY!!
"Once owned by Pablo Escobar"   DAMNNNNNNNNN
The sandwiches and ego waffles killed me 😂
This is all ballshit
watch out from Tsunami
Fun Fact:  The friendly feral pigs and sunken plane they showed in the promotional vid are nowhere near where the concert venue was going to be.
Announcing Dashcon 2017! $250000 ticket band attendees guaranteed ballpit access!
I won't lie, seeing rich millennials getting scammed puts a smile on my face.
Wow! This looks like a lotta fun! I'm gonna go!  Anybody got 12 grand they can loan me?
I'm starting to think that this whole thing was the most elaborate 4chan prank ever. /b/ has finally hit godmode.
What's the song used for this trailer?
buying my ticket for next year. cant wait
I'll go on the trip for the promo video next year 😂😂👏🏾👏🏾
Lapland New Forest anyone?
WE'RE GONNA BUILD A GULAG AND MAKE THE BOURGEOISIE PAY FOR IT
Ja Rule was a hero we never expected but got.
LOL I love how people already started puting up FYRE t-shirts on amazon :D https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0713X83DB
Russian joke from 90s:  - Hey, nice tie! How much have you paid for it? - $50. - You fool, I know a place where it costs $1000!   Fyre Festival.
hahahaha little rich brats got screwed over!!
Why would these people pay money to go to the Bahamas to listen to music that sounds like kitchen appliances having a seizure?
Spent 500 to see David Gilmour in Pompeii and even I thought that was high.
I'm just waiting for the promotional ad featuring the upcoming lawsuit against Ja Rule hahha
Anyone know what the song is called? That's about the best thing out of this whole project.
this video could be used as a VS bathing suit ad
HAHAHAHAHA RAHS YOU HAVE BEEN MMMMMEEEEEEERRRRRRKKKKKEEED! M. E. R. K. E. D.
First line: "The actual experience exceeds all expectations...."
HAHAA, its so funny to see all those white people get finessed out of their money... What a bunch of dummies.
Fyre Festival, something liberals and conservatives can agree on.  Schadenfreude is sweet.
look closer at promo... looks like a hip lesbian holiday......
This was a Scam... go check Mark Dohner's video
The moral of the story is, get some morals and stop following fucking rappers.
I am laughing at the rich trust fund kids who were taken for a ride, and whats wrong with sweaty cheese sandwiches, some people don't even have that.
As someone who really didn't get wind of the festival until after it turned into a refugee crisis, I gotta say, looking back, this promo is fucking terrible. Shit, Sandals commercials are better.
It turn out to be The Hunger Games! ROTFL!!
"From the same island that Tom Hanks was stranded on in cast away and the one where scientists created a bunch of dinosaurs, Fyre festival coming soon"
Look at the bright side, at least the attendees didn't have to endure a Blink 182 concert.
0:57 'On the boundaries of impossible' I mean, how ironic. :v
I wonder if the flights were Avianca
I'm legit thankful that I NEVER heard of this until last week... If you dropped 5 figures to be "exclusive" and "cool" you deserved to get ripped off.
Ripped off by your own ego.
who is the one with the blonde, curly hair at 0:46
Uh huh we see how this went lol  B.S.
A fool and his money are soon parted.
Perfect analogy for what sin promises and then what the devil actually delivers.  John 3:16
How the fuck did these idiots even get into my country....what is out coast guards even doing?!?!
That's what you get if you are as shallow as a sheet of paper; desperate & dying to be cool. Why would anyone pay up to $125,000 for services rendered by Ja Rule?? Like I said earlier, it's what they deserve.
Look up Ja Rule Duets on youtube.  Funny ass skits.
Bourgeois teens being forced to take part in a Hunger Games style battle for resources. Amazing. 10/10 festival
So many stupid people bought into this 😂
Hey rich scums! You got scammed! Now feel what it's like too be poor and suffer losing your money!
They should have kept them on the island. Those trust fund millenials give the rest of us a bad name.
Yeah we get it, there were supposed to be bikinis. I hope no Exuma pigs were inconvenienced by the 'partygoers'! :P
GIVE THEM SOME MILK HA HA HA HA
How about announced flat earth already. Wake up sheep if stationary /no spinning earth
Looks great.... I can't wait
I305 is my fav coaster if the GP doesn't not what I305 means it means intiminador 305
But the thumbnail is not a rollercoaster
I live in Valencia, California! Home of Goliath!
i think i feel worse for the little bird... (Dont laugh America)
The GP 🙄🙄🙄🙄, so in accurate and annoying
2:51 Uh what one there's like 8 of them. Oh the one at Magic Mountain!
wow i did not now that
Kingda ok is not the tallest roller coaster it's the skyscraper
and I thought the stop drop zone was bad
I'm going to six flags magic mountain this Sunday and I'm going on Goliath I love that ride
its not Grand Adventure its GREAT Adventure. i went on King Da Ka cause im from Jersey, and let me say ITS EPIC
I live in NJ so i went to Kingda Ka
Yes I live in New Jersey and kinda ka is the winner ps it's scary  D:
The richest:  Get to your roller coasters   Me:  I hate heights and I hate roller coasters
What about top thrill dragster
Danger is my brothers middle name BUT hes a real chicken he wouldnt even ride the haunted mansion in Disneyland
I went to Canada's wonderland and tried all the roller coaster's there, it's amazing.
Uhhh so ur just gonna ignore millennium force and top thrill dragster
No joke but my dad's middle name is Edward danger
roses are red violets are blue i got clickbaited and so did you
Howmame rollocoster R in Japan tell me
I am 9 and went on the mako it is in Oralondr the first drop is 200 feet over 70 miles pur hour and 7,000 something feet long
😀 so cool       😎
I rode the Titan :)
I've rode Titan twice I think
nice vid!  But it's Great Adventure,  not grand. signed.... the Jersey girl
I threw up just listening to this
i went on goliath
fury its fun not even scary went like more than 10 times
Nice video, I'll be sure to watch more of your top 10's. :)
I wouldn't wanna go on/onto these rides because I'm petrified of heights.
Omg 😲 I went to six flags in New Jersey I saw the ride just looking at it was scary I was to short to go on it
I went on the Titan before but in Dallas
its called six flags great adventure
And my friend died in the 😅 track
I broke my arm
Hold on WTF. I live in Texas and I've been to Six Flags over Texas many times and written the Titan since I was six and you're telling me it's one of the most crazy roller coasters in the world what the hell
my brother and sisters and me have gone on golith and have not blacked out or got blood in there face
My cousin and my uncle they when on super man when they went to six flags in Chicago
I sub and likes
what about the Hollywood rip ride rocket
Its Six Flags Great Adventure haha.
Can you make a video about the fastest coasters in the world? Suggestion: Speed monster in tusenfryd Norway. 90kmh in 2 seconds and only runs for 40 seconds
Fujiyama: Best coaster by TOGO
We have the GP right here. And, Six Flags *GRAND* adventure? *IT'S GREAT*
the intimidator is in Charlotte,North Carolina and fort mill,South Carolina at Carowinds.
Stop being  a bully
The park Kinda Ka is at is called Six Flags Great Adventure, not Six Flags Grand Adventure
I subscribed, but this video is so cringy. Half of the facts in this video are false, and none of these coasters are scary, they just have big stats
This video is so GP
THE intimidator 305 it's just intimidator 305
But titan and Goliath are the same roller coaster they are just at two different places and they have a different name
The richest is right the hud is a good youtuder
I subscribed
I subscribed
I HAVE BEEN TO KINGS DOMINION AND CAROWINDS SINCE I LIVE NEAR SOUTH CAROLINA SO I HAVE BEEN ON THE FURY AND IT WAS SCARYYYYY 
I subscribed
It's not six flags grand adventure it's six flags great adventure
The first time i went to kings dominion i went on the intimidator 305 in the front seat with my cousin i almost died
guys try to get this to a 100lieks for him it would make His day!
wtf even is this video... what about top thrill dragster? Six flags "grand" adventure? do some research before making a facts list dude
I HAVE TO RIDE THE TITAN AND TEXAS GIANT WITH MY FRIEND D:. IM GONNA DIE!
Six flags GREAT adventure... king da ka is hella scary btw
Goliath is in Six Flags Great America now
you forgot the top thrill dragster in cedar point, in sandusky, ohio it's the second tallest coaster in the world
Unless you're talking about the one in sfog that one is awesome
Thanks for SCARING me FOR LIFE  !!!!!!!!!!!
And Goliath is pretty much the same as titan
And Titan sucks
Roller coasters are very safe you are actually more likely to die going to the park than you are at the park.
7th subscribe to me
How come this video has no comments?
LOL too funny! Now grab the popcorn and wait for all the entitled wussies out that that do the same thing call this jeep guy names. hahahaha
Is this fake?
I would make it 8 flat tires on those jeeps if that was my car!
Looks staged, plenty of other parking spaces. Are these punks the parking police.
Whats the model of that white one
00:24 The "Pranked" guy is in on it. He's sitting on the curb waiting for his part in the skit lol
You guys parked like bigger idiots. There are open spots in front.
What if he has child with a medical emergency? Don´t forget: what goes around comes around. Big dislike.
Fake, guy is sitting at the kerb at the 24 sec mark.
look another fake video
Fake ass video. Can clearly see the hatchback owner at 0:24
Good! He should've have rather reverse parked it!
FaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaKE
what if he was trying to be quick cuz his mom is in the hospital or some shit
fake - @24 seconds, see merc driver
Useless staged vid posted for likes and publicity. Merc driver is sitting on pavement at 0:15.
what is this wea?
Fake. At 0:14 you can see the hatchback owner sitting on the curb watching the white keep reverse. Load of shit this is
0:14 the driver of the Mercedes is sitting there and recording lol
Fake. You can see the Mercedes owner sitting on the kerb at 0:14 watching everything happeneing.
stop the video at 0:24 an there you can see the mercedes owner. Hmm it's not a fake video kappa
Justice is served!
Please neckyourselves jeep owners. Also fake and waiting for this social degenerate to disable ratings/comments. Flagged
Fake...that guy is one of your friend.
Wow just when you think there's nothing lamer than a douche in a  Mercedes here come a bunch of 4 x 4 jackholes to prove me wrong. I would have keyed your shit.
never seen a more obvious fake video lol
0:24 lol if you're ganna stage a prank for views at least make sure you don't have your cast in the set-up. Your man is sitting there on the curb waiting for the "prank" to start.
That guy did not upset anyone, there was plenty of parking space!  But you guys did offend him on purpose! Conclusion: you two are the offenders.
0:24 - the pranked guy is watching getting pranked ... nice fake guys.
These Jeep guys need parking cards!! If I knew where to send them to, I'd order some for them myself! https://www.etsy.com/listing/121976297/set-of-12-you-suck-at-parking-have-a?ref=shop_home_active_4
FAKE, if someone kicks my car, even the wheels, i dont even think about kicking his ass
two fucking idiots in big cars
Fake - 0:14 sec you can see same Mercedes owner sitting and filming.
yawn... more fake ass youtube clickbate
bet i woulda shattered the windshields of both the jeeps, and carried on with my day...
fake can see the benz driver sitting at the curb in the beginning of the video.
The guy is sitting at the curb while the jeeps are parking..... 0:16.
Of course it would be a Washington driver who parks like that xD
losers faking shit, nothing to see here
another staged gay ass video. you can see the benz driver sitting on the curb @ 00:15.
Fake or not, plenty of space or not, it's still a good way to teach people who multi-space park a lesson to not take up two spaces at all.
if u did that to me I would fucken reck u and ur jeep u dumb ass American
The only off roading that tuff Jeep is doing is a parking lot ,  lmfao 4wheeling meme pussies
sure they could have not parked next to him without closing out his sides, but that teaches no lesson
0:27? Wait for who?? He s sitting right in front of you where you tried to hide! You fake ass mofo!
heheh nice try fake shit.
You idiots do know, the reason why that new Mercedes is away from the front, and on double parking is because of idiots like you that would care to ding the car at the owners expense?
what if there were a lot of other cars what made mercedes owner to park like this? you never know...
you all do realize this is all staged right
total fake shit
All JEEP is a big shit... :)

RESPONDING TO MEAN COMMENTS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2HJt8YG4nc
worst 24 hours of your life.  poor baby
All I can say is that it's a good thing it wasn't this generation that had to fight Hitler, because this generation wouldn't stand a chance!
not too sure why this is getting hate they went on a holiday/weekend out and it was a complete disaster id be pissed aswell for the price/how luxurious it should have been i think they just a bit jelly tbh
I hate rich hipsters like this douche, bad taste in music , hahaha if this was the worst day of your life than your life is Grand
wow, what a nightmare!
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Rich people got pranked so hard
damn, poor you. spoiled piece of shit
Put your hat on. Why you wearing it like a crown?
This was so fucking entertaining hahah idiots and their money.....
wow look at these utterly awful gobshites
10:40 What is the background song?
Wow. Just as bad as it looked on tumblr.
You need to change your hair and hat. Despite when you speak you sound like Zac Efron. From a British person you look like a 14 year old thug, that's how they dress.
nice reality check for these spoiled brats , loving it actually , wpuld be even better if the organizers just did it totally on purpose and scammed the shit out of these kids
go to a festival that cares
I must say that these tents and beds don't look that bad. I
I really hate this guy. But I just can't put my finger on why...
What a fascinating and chaotic experience. Thanks for documenting this.
looked rough in business class on the plane.  That was one of the worst 24hrs???  Rough life.. it woudl only be worse if mom and dad weren't there to pick them up on the return
Fyre Festival: Ever wondered what it feels like to be a Syrian refugee? Wonder no more!
how many times do you want to adjust your hat?
Perfect first person view  Well done muchacho  Edit: PS walking outside at dawn--utterly disoriented--is as authentic Miami as you can get. You actually saved yourselves money vs going to Mynt
wow jarule wtf
Seems like you need a better fitting hat with how much you're always fixing it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
They shouldve just left everyone who went there on the island. Wouldve been great for humanity.
Yo can't lie, this video proved how important vlogging is. I've read a lot about this situation but this video really showed what it was like from start to finish. Felt the struggle stillllllll
VIP SCHOOL BUS!!!
that's a crappy weekend. But the tents weren't too bad but I use to be in Peace Corps. XD   you guys paid money so it's shitty. I hope that lawsuit against the organizers go through.
YOu are incredidibly fucking privilaged if this is the worst 24 hours of your life you rich fuck. Learn some real god damn hardship, fucking moron.
Bro you should start daily vlogging or travel vlogging dope video
LOL, what a bunch of spoiled hipster cunts. They should have held the festival just to have a target to nuke from orbit.
What they did not know was that this was actually a government plan to lure all the douchebags onto a remote island then leave them there. OPERATION DOUCHE AND DASH.
Greatest Finesse of our time
u guys are weak for letting those people take your tents,not cool of those assholes
No amount of adjusting your stupid fucking hat will make you any less of a tool. There's a reason dislikes are twice as high as likes on this video.
fuckin white people 😆
Remind me.. are we the same species that landed on the moon and stormed the beaches at Normandy?
Why would you pay that much money to see GARBAGE acts? You guys really looked distraught laughing and joking the entire video...  Spoiled rich kids.
This couldn't have happened to a more deserving bunch of over privileged little bitches. Welcome to the real world you elitists pussies.
Lol looks like they had a good time though.
Bunch. of. cunts.
this video reminds me that i should love all of gods creatures... even the exceptionally douchey creatures
it was only 5 hundred a ticket??? that's pretty decent honestly
00:38 Ok, those beds aren't the WORST....
Well, you and your friends are idiots, no complaint for 6 hours out of food or drinks, you went to a festival, you are not a refugee in war zone, clown.
You poor baby! Did your privileged life get medium tolerable for a few hours?
Holy crap I wasn't hating until this fucking entitled prick calls it the worst 24 hours of his life. Must be nice. Lmao.
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
Glad you made and your squad made it home safe. From what I have seen and read people were stuck in the Bahamas for days. Hopefully you will get your money back.
Pretty Funny.... I'm sure they're fine. Rough Day, that's all...
So... Where was the disaster?  You were inconvenienced for 24 hours at your choice and your complaining?  Try, oh I don't know Boot Camp?  Surviving a Tornado/Hurricane!  U millennial are such puss's...
Dude you had a great attitude about it haha
Honestly this is freaking hilarious.
I can't feel sorry for rich kids; I just can't. 24 hours of waiting, not hard work, not sick... just waiting. the next day they wake up rich again so fuck it.
Drinking game: drink every time he adjusts his hat...you'll be hammered in 12 mins
Stupid rich kids will be stupid rich kids... ROTMFLMMFAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Twat waffles!!! LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOOOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
Can't believe some of the comments on here. Incredibly rude to someone whom none of these people have met in real life :\
damn so many people got trolled to the max ... my favorite part was when you saw ppl carrying mattresses
huh, never been on the fuckboy side of youtube before.
Dude if that was one of the worst 24 hours you have ever had in your life then, well, I guess you have had one hell of a lucky life :D apart from that, it sucks, what a rip off - Ja Rule already started passing the buck
when you guys stood on the airports' scale you showed me that you deserved to get fucked out of $500.  before it was just amusing but now I actually don't like you douchebags.
Lawsuits are coming.........
watching all these assholes pixie wanderlust dreams turn into nightmares is my favorite thing
These are the type of asshole festival goers that ruined coachella im SO happy this happened to them lol
Bhahahahaha poor little whitebejewbees, righteous schadenfreude
I like this Ja Rule guy.. He had rich retarded kids pay $13000 to live like the refugees and poor people their parents want to dehumanize and keep out of america.
500 dollars for an all paid experience? just sounds too good to be true lol... i mean think about it.. if something sounds too good to be true then it probably is LOL
OMG if this is the worst day of your life you have been really privileged. I'm just going to sit here and laugh at you for a couple of minutes 😂
Good vlog. Got to see it first hand.
You poor thing!
The guy on the bus "Maybe we get to burn it down at the end." 😂
enjoyed seeing these wee pricks "suffer". they should do one of these every year. could only be improved upon if  we got fatalities
LOL, great video man! When I imagine the kind of people that would attend such an "event", you and your group fit perfectly into that stereotype.
the rich kid hunger games!
Stupid rich kid got conned
People need to chill like ok does that make you a douche for spending $500 with your best friends to go to disney world or LA? People cannnn vacation sometimes! :)

Hahaha..Aap Log Kamaal Ho Yaar. I am new Youtuber. Can you take out two mins and have a look at my work. Thank you. Happiness to everyone
I dont mean to be that guy, but I do not trust black QBs. Just like I don't trust white anything else for maybe kickers, punters, and linemen. lol
Niners get Bears on that man that is stupid move give that number of picks for guy that play only 13 games in Collage
I know right
Yo where are Corey Davis's highlights? Smh
Don't get me wrong, getting drafted to play a sport you love is pretty awesome, but getting drafted in the top 10 spots means your playing for the worst teams in the NFL, that doesn't seem to exciting.
why the stink eye @1:31 😂😂
Those picks the 49ers received from the Bears will probably be busts anyway.  Shanahan sucks
Trubisky sucks? Strong words for a guy that's played exactly 0 downs in the NFL. If he pans out, Everyone who doubted will have to eat those words. Go Bears!!! (my 2nd team)
Christian mcCaffrey will be future solid Patriots player.
I get we lost to the Flats, but in all honesty ( wink wink ) they probably cheated. Go Falcons!!
I smell a bust with the Bears
NFL Historians. WHEN was the last white RB selected in the first round? I have been watching NFL since 1970, and i can only think of Csonka in about 1968, Riggins in the early 1970s and that is about it. Thoughts?
La Chargers looks like a threat now , AFC west is loaded
OMG MYLES GARRET IS A COMPLETE BEAST THAT DUDE Is GOING TO DOMINATE AND I'M A PATRIOTS FAN
They don't look happy
keyand peele should do like a episode on how the NFL draft is kind of like an auction back in the day. or at least it seems like it 😂😂😂
Browns did great in the draft 🔥🔥
My Panthers might get somewhere again
McCaffrey is a bad choice, really--too small!
Trubisky can't be bad until he plays so people need to shut up
For all current sports talk check out and subscribe to my channel UNEDUCATED SPORTS TALK hosted by Carlos Clayton..Thanks
jags gonna be raw next year
Panthers got a good rb
What a feeling that must be made into a celebrity in the blink of an eye
I never really good at seeing NFL Draft why are people saying The Chicago Bears made a bad move?
myles garett looks like nick cannon
First round picks always goes to the Cleveland Clowns!😂
I see a future in Jacksonville for the first time in a long time and it scares me. It won't be this season, but there isn't a single thing that Leonard Fournette can't do
Trubisky will be best quarterback in 2017 and the best ever
Mike Williams Doesn't Look to Happy Lmfao
1:09 OVERALLL
Texans made some great picks. Expect them to be in the Superbowl mix this year
9:24 No Deshaun watson for Kansas City chiefs????? You can hear Rich Eaison "Ohhhhhhhhhh"
my dolphins so stupid for not grabbing Reuben Foster like wtf
Why is myles garrett smiling
Browns still going to take the L the whole season 😂💀
Look I'm a bears fan and I don't like the trubisky pick, but the man has not played an NFL game yet he deserves to prove himself
Mike Williams didn't seem that happy to be on the chargers.
bears want to be the rams
i like how we keep hearing that none of these QBs should be drafted in the 1st round year after year haha.
KC IS NUTZ!!!!!!!
My Jets drafted two safeties in rounds 1 and 2. You can pretty much hand them the Lombardi now.
Carolina has their colors at QB and RB mixed up.
I still don't understand the Bears with that 2nd pick
Mahomes is a great pick for the Chiefs. Andy Reid is good at developing quarterbacks, Alex Smith is a good quarterback to learn from and that defense is good enough to get them to the Super Bowl, love that pick.
Mike Williams wasn't excited at all
Myles Garret had that fake koolaid smile when he got picked by the doo doo browns
Swing and a miss for the bears #WhyTrubisky
Why is there Donald Trump sitting next to Patrick mahomes
Did the bears honestly believe that the 49ers were going to get mitchell trubisky with the 2nd overall pick?
im a 49ers fan and I'm nomad at there selections they passed on so many good players
The Bears are so stupid they werent going to take Mitch jc theyre so stupid
Corey Davis...white parents?? hope he doesn't turn into a kapersnick
Booing Roger Goodell is the worst tradition in sports history. It just has no point at all.
at least browns didn't mess up this time
It's disrespectful that the NFL or I meant to say the draft guys not even mention Greg Ward JR or Donnel Pumphery all they did for college football for the last few years smh.
Browns did great this draft Garret,Peppers,Njoku,Kizer. 2 potential beast on defense and 2 potential offensive weapons. I don't think they could do better
Let's go Pats...oh wait...they haven't drafted yet
I was surprised af to see Bears Take Tribuisky
I want to be optimistic but it's hard af being a Chicagoan right now. My bulls are blowing a 2-0 lead and now the Bears completely destroy our chances of getting in the playoffs for 3 years
people didn't think Tom Brady was gonna be good he was pick late just give trubisky a chance
Wow, Bears were desperate as hell huh
Why trade your pick of the 49ers aren't gonna pick trubisky
I love the Jamal Adams pick. But now where's the rest of our team 🤷🏾‍♂️
why mike williams look salty asf
fournette reminds me of earl campbell he gonna wear out quick cause he's gonna get hit
If Mahomes ends up kicking ass in KC, I guarantee "The Mahomes of the Chiefs" is going to be a thing. I'm calling it.
I wanted Watson, I didn't really know who Mahomes was, but after looking him up, Jon Gruden talked me into liking him. And now I'm glad we got him. Chiefs Kingdom baby! I feel sorry for Alex though, I really like him.
RIP CHIEFS.
I was in the car when we drafted trusbisky and I slammed in the breaks and almost got into an accident
The browns made a good pick
I'm a titans fan and I wanted Mike Williams sooooo bad, but I really do respect Corey Davis
It wouldve been hilarious if browns had choked hard and picked someone else instead if garret
My cousin is Tyler Boyd. I'm surprised to see the bengals pickup a wide out first round.
Bears are idiots u trade all of those picks and the 49ers still get solamon Thomas and rubeon foaster
Giants got the best player in first round
Jamie Collins no longer on suicide watch.
that announcement of Christian McCaffrey was racist
now the real draft begins... rounds 2 through 7
The Bears and Browns are similar. Screwing up opportunities
Hey guys it's time to join that bears bandwagon before all the seats run out
my buddies cat looks so much like woody. She's grown and she purches on our shoulders to this day.
This is not a video. It's a slideshow.  Stop it.
Awwww, Woody is such an adorable little kitten!!! Thank you so much for rescuing him!!!
l only like female cats. Hate male tomcats.
Baby kittens do that alot, they perch on shoulders and on chests. They want to be as close to the human as possible.
I had one of those. Sandra will just have to master the skill of one hand cooking and work up some muscle.
And they named him Woody!  <3  How adorable is that!  <3 Thank you for rescuing this sweet baby. I KNOW he'll have a great home with you.
however  burlap sack a couple of bricks and a deep river is what you need to take that cat swimming. don't forget to put your comments down below and like us on Facebook.
they bought that cat at the pet store in New York City.
here we go again with this FAKE NEWS...
thats lifted my spirits a bit,guess we know who will be top at there
"Woody is small enough, for now, to perch up there, but at some point, he is going to be too big"   How naive. My fully grown, fat-ass catbaby will crawl up onto my shoulders almost every time we snuggle.
How could anyone down-vote this video???
Hooray for Woody!
"Thinks he's a bird" yeah right he's jus chilling on your shoulder nothing to do with thinking he's a bird.
love these endings with sweet people
Really nice story abd what a great lass for adoping the lovely kitten x
...and they named him Woody.  I'm guessing because of the pallet where they found him..?  So cute!
Little thing...
the 51 people who thumbed down are antifa terrorist that hate everybody
Aw so sweet so glad he was rescued 💕
Aw so sweet so glad he was rescued ❤️
Woody is adorable, I want him, lol. Thanks for giving him a loving home!!!
precious, thanks for the rescue and the story
What a sweet kitty!
No cat is too big to perch on a shoulder
Thank you for taking care of and adopting Woody.  Blessings to you both!
That was really cute. I love cats.
So cute!!!!!!
How sweet! Home at last.
Thank you Miss Sandra for Giving Woody a little love . You are an awesome person I wish I could give you a million dollars
Awwww shweeet!!! My kitty cat lived to the ripe old age of 19, a record in our household of kitties.
thank you for rescung such a precious life! he is absolutely precious, darling, and purrfect!!!
I found a wild kitten near my house. (My cat led me to it.) I took care of it for 1 night. It wanted constant attention. My cat died of cancer and AIDs 1 month later.
He's one handsome guy. Glad he found a forever home
0:45 ooh titties. me hungry for milk.
Simply cute :)
Just a baby...for the love of God ,some of them do make it...precious Woody..
very touching
I had a rescue kitten that loved to be on my shoulder and as she got older I had to hold her there or she draped herself around my neck. It's amazing what cats will do for cuddles.
it has 30 dislikes
How we treat animals mirrors our own souls.
he is beautiful
Aww, what a precious little baby! Such a happy story.
I had a cat who was still convinced she was a shoulder kitty at ten pounds.
preety cool
rescue cats are the best. they give you so much love. I miss my cats.
Happy for Sandra and Woody ... Have a long and happy life together.
Reminds me of my kitten named Garnet. ❤
aww, so adorable! thanks for rescuing him. bless you.
may   god  bless  the  person  who  rescued   kitty
Woody is adorable! God bless you😸❤ You are a hero!
Thank you for rescuing Woody! 😻
Awesome!!! Thank You!!!! This is why I have 9 cats now, and feed about 6 regular strays outside. Worth the effort! The Best Friends I have ever had! Best wishes to you and Woody! ENJOY EVERY SECOND!!!
My cats name was Woody aka Elwood. Just loved that fella. I miss him. Such a good friend.
I LOVE KITTIES
Thankyou ! God will repay U when U least expect it for your kindness.
poor baby I hope sombody,takes care of that kitten.
My cat allergies don't matter right now.Hallelujah, this cat found a great home.
Appreciate your kindness and efforts!
May God bless your soul and I am so glad that you have saved little Woody!! Woody is an adorable little cutie pie!! A very precious and sweet kitty cat!!😻
Aww what a sweetheart.
I'm actually crying, my god it's been so long, thank you for reminding me that I'm not dead inside.
sometimes the prize finds the winner !!!
Aw you are a good human being and have a furever buddy. One of my buddies perched on my shoulders even when he was an adult and 18 lbs :)
sweet boy he was lucky someone loving found him and saved him
You know darn well that kitty will never see your shoulder as something too small to perch on. That cat can grow to the size of a Maine Coon & will see your shoulder as a resting place.
Awww... Thank you Sandra for sharing. You should know however, Woody isn't really a cat, he's an alien sent to earth to steal your heart. Nailed it! :)
you made a grown man 😢   thank you for rescuing Woody  I have done the same for stray 🐱 last year
Obviously the cat hates everything about you and cannot wait to leave......;)
I'm happy for woody. 😊
beautiful! wow!
I love you please marry me
Blah, Blah, Blah, I'm going to save the blacks.  Good Luck!

I think everybody did a terrific job. Anyone who post hurtful or offensive comments, is just a hater.
I LOCE YOU BRUNO I WISH I CAN GO TO THE 24MAGIC WORLD TOUR!!!!!!!!!!!
I love this video
It has to be true.  You can't make this @$&@ up!
Rephrasing the old proverb: Keith Olbermann barks, but the caravan goes on.
I'm surprised the Germans think the world's over all the things they did in the last century. I know Belgium and France. still remembers. EVERY DAY
Keith Olbermann needs to stop promotion cuckery
I love Donald Trump!!!!! So thankful he is our president! God bless the USA USA USA USA!!!
Keith is way to triggered. Stop whining Keith. RESIST LMFAO what a joke.
Keith is just a brainwashed liberal and America know's it. Keith lost his job that's why he has a show on youtube.
this dude is insane. trump is carrying out the same jewish agenda clinton would've.
This faggy rich white liberal is still crying about Trump. You shitlibs have 4 more years of this <3.
lmao awesome video.😘😘😘😘
Can't wait for episode 69
the resistance? you mean the regressives
Hey Heath, where are you during those scrums? Can't find the 'boxer content' to take you there? So STfU then!!
well, we have real and free journalism in europe.
Keith, you're amazing. Hang in there--keep us informed.
Keith is a true savage
I watch this liberal propaganda puke and laugh! Hope you catch at least one straw you are grasping for! Lmao!!!
Just a question...when did our media ever ask Obama any questions? Or Hillary any questions? Suck on it Olberman...your tears make Trump happy
Can journalism really counter the ideology he established? I hope so
TL;DR: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
If you where going to compare this to Star Wars the left would be the 1st order and the right would be the resistance.... Just sayin, you aren't the resistance.
Lol the resistance is pathetic
Trump is delusional and in the beginning stages of dementia.
The Universal Laws (part-157)
Ask him when is he going to release his taxes? lmao
Need to know only.Some press ask the most ridiculous questions, i would flat out ignore them.Others ask real questions.
I love Keith.....yes #resist
And while they're at it, perhaps they could ask Republicans in the House why they voted for that crap fest they euphemistically call the American Health Care Act.
"White nationalist" What's wrong with being white and what's wrong with wanting your own government running your country???
Oh god liberal propaganda at its finest. Suck up them tears
ME THINKS THOU DOES PROTEST TOO MUCH !!
AND TRUMP THANKS YOU FOR THE ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION OF HIM AS POTUS!
babbling whino
Trump 2020.
AMERICA HAS BEEN FASCIST SINCE TRUMP WAS BORN!!!!!
AND TRUMP WAS RIGHT ON EVERYTHING !!!
USA Government has become a bad reality show
hahahahahahah this has to be a JOKE! hahahahahahahaha
Because the press is FAKE NEWS!
Yes look how he treat and defeats Melanie
TRUMP is a slob and dangerous
This autocrat reminds me of King Henry the 8th ... Change the world to suit his needs .Fat slobs .
Thanks Keith. Just do one thing for me. Stay calm, you may not have healthcare any more. We need you. Resist
What happened to Olberman. He's gone off his rocker. Settle down Keith. You will live and so will the country.
"The resistance" lol. Grow up.
Liar, liar.  The Media is our enemy.  FAKE NEWS, HOAXES and other BS has to stop.
Kieth, you are an idiot!!!
How is this moron always trending? He makes alex jones look sane. This dipshit thinks we are at war with russia.
Any one else come to dislike only
Could you imagine making a career off of bitching about someone? How does this guy have a job lmao
I swear to God.... Ivanka should use her mouth for some good purposes... like keeping her daddy satisfied.   Just tell her it's a tiny cheeto.
pretty soon.. the only "news" will be fox, infowhores (aka infowars), and Lightmyfart (aka breitbart)
Kieth is such a has been, even ESPN laughs at him and their ratings are at rock bottom.  #Keithdouchebag
i remember a time when GQ was a manly magazine.....now smh.....
I love the reports, however I think it taking it's toll on good old olberman. March on D.C.
Because the media is too busy making up lies
Next time on GQ: "Trump is bad"  And stay tuned for the following week's episode: "Trump is bad"
Trump is one of the Greatest Pres. in History
This guy is the Alex Jones of the left. What a nutcase lol.
TRUMP! MAGA! keep crying. President Trump is doing a fine job so far.
I am truly sad that you are losing it Keith NOT...
Better question: Why won't the press report real news?
lol, wtf is going in the world? GQ is "the resistance"? Aren't you guys the magazine that names a "sexiest man alive" every year?
The wall is getting pinker, wtf .
Fool as a president.
lol .. idiot
Dump Trump!!!
lol. Where was this guy when Obama was president? you ppl r such a joke.
Just ask the hard hitting questions you had for Obama, what is his favorite color, how did you get so cool, can I hang out with you and make out?  You leftists need to get our of your sick echo chamber.
Mr. Olbermann, you sir are the pathfinder who is lighting those well overdue flames that need to be lit so that we can see through this fog, thank you sir.
God giveth and the demon devil taketh away...lmfao!!!!!!!
keith back on top form!
I didn't realize that the liberal snowflakes had a king... ;)
In America, we tend to let everything go. We just plain forget and accept things and move along. Sometimes that can be a good thing. Not this time, We can't let this go...
To preserve, protect, and defend, and CHANGE the constitution?  NEVER!!!!
"I don't stand by anything", said Trump.  Well, yes ... we sorta had just started to notice that, maybe a little bit ...
Bloberman is such a bafoon
the media are a lot of weak punks that is scared to be honest in asking the true question ...why is american allowing the trump lovers to run this country ?
BTw, Humble does not mean weak baby.
I don't have a problem if a person doesn't put their hand on their heart during the National anthem
Stand up to the orange bully basterd. Ask why we let our news cater to ratings the military  and right wing nut jobs over truth. News is fake, just no way whatsoever in the way Trump bullshits it is
THANK YOU FOR THIS!  The media is beyond pathetic!!
what is this shit?
Now i know how people kill themselves!
pls kill me...

Nerdcubed brought me here

#Freesomething
Better hers than mine!
SO young and drives again!)) OMG!
📽Vybz Kartel Version of Loodi has now been *removed from YouTube *  Click here: https://youtu.be/PxPan8IMxYk
Spice and other shenseea haters are the cause of all this theatrics, shenseea ft kartel or vice versa both are on the same track,
Y'all rate this ugly ass bitch this chick ugly as fuckkkkkk
This man looking hoe fuck this ugly bitch ya hear the boss him say it was not ah collaboration
freee kartel
The Collaboration has already cemented itself on most of us, hence it will be more appreciated. Furthermore it represent the song well from a male and female prospective.
I love the original way more as well and I think shenseea and her swine manager are just opportunists
Shenseea is not digecel to give Credit
I love love love the original shenseea fi gweh
both songs sounds good but the fake collaboration hit more.
eee so a kartel  a talk bout pussy fat up inna short shorts,, eeee
THE ORIGINAL AHHHH MADDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!! BIG UP WORRLLBOOSSSSS WORLBOSS
all that name calling for loodi jus buss the song moreeee ... #trinidad #bigup
Song was made Littt kartel and shenseea vershon was my my fav just saying 
lawsuits out shenseea and are manager pussy gal too bright
deh gal deh a fake she jus cute nothing else back a dat
FUCK Shenseea AKA SHENSTEALA Next time when your on a radio station You Better say Kartel is king of dance hall Then SUCK his DICK for making you famous BITCH.Her career is over.
my point is why wait 10 years to bitch about it?
A me alone see seh di official audio get tek down from youtube?
dah gyal yah sound like a man to me move har BBC cah she well and know to seh a thief she thief it
you should find out if infaref was really a collab
Two a them bad.. especially the original... and she neva give the man the real credit.. A him buss you...  obviously .. admit it
Shenseea need to work on her voice though... she can't manage certain notes which is why when she goes up she sounds like a chihuahua yapping
the song its better with Shenseea and why he waited so long to make this public.
all hater's leave the girl alone everyone want to style the girl now much love Shenseena#Up like 11 Star's boss say that Oooosh she can't get in any problem are trouble for the song 
Everybody a figet Martel is in jail. Shen Shen deh a road. If any Jamaica even took the time to understand how the music industry work,  all you would hang your heads in shame.
Why did she stole it from his website she stole Loodi then Happy Juk both in a different ways she only changed some of the words
yow is man or woman ah talk can somebody plz tell me
fuck scamseea pamputtae did right in every way.
shensea version sound better you really need to stop being bias also she didn't say she write it you people really need to shut up
goooooo dehhhhhh Carib Fusion!!!!!!...dem cyaa hold you now!!!!! #2 on trending and 54+k in 1 day n counting...dem cyaa hold yuh!!!
like the vybz only version...
the original lame it honestly nuh sound god at all... all a wonder if a supm in him throat...
Right now alkaline a sing nuff a kartel song too 😒😂😂😂😂
with shenssea
Addi a shot back at all the crooks. #Alka u and #GullyPad next 😈
we Nuh care wah sound better the matter to the fact is a kartel song not sheenseea
shen sea the best one kartel jus realize
That is even more reason for her to give credit, Since she didn't write any of it.
If a never loodi uno wouldn't know Shenseea
why kartel a come out wid this now, cause shenseea neva give him d credit, yah wah God. And watch shenseea interview she seh a so unique  song kmt. kartel d truth is ur version L-A-M-E baaaad
lol god know say Kartel a me artist but me no think he would allow him self fe sing if he was is one warder. Shenseea a pure ants in a u bed yah now.
you can tell this lady has a gap
The version with shenseea sounds nice but the sad thing is barely of the words came from her
Romeich a get piece man a suh dat unauthorized collaboration ,if unauthorized by di Gaza boss, could have been released.
original is always better then a stolen carbon copy no given credit fraud
no way the original soumd better kmft.. leave the girl alone
She never give the props....she deserve the DISS
I think the original sounds better #GazaGenahsyde
i never did like how she sing her part she was eat up the words after words i rather kartel do it by him self
smh shenseesa a weh u get urself into? smh so it go..when u align wid certain people then u just ago end up get fuck someday..
ME DID THINK ALKAFISH ALONE THIEF FROM DADDY, SMH!   GAZA NATION ALWAYS EXPOSES ITS FOOT STOOLS! #GAZA #GENNA #SPARTA 1ST
Who cares if she didn't write the song, what is most important is that Kartel receives his rightful credits and is compensated appropriately
the collab is obviously better, there is not much to say about that, but hey, when you wrong , you wrong. Its not the first time I'm seeing something like this though.
Jamaicans are always hating on each other
I rather the colab. It sounds way better than the original audio
Come on y'all,KARTEL and Shenseea know about this ,it's a publicity stunt.
Romeich onstage didn't talk about Loodi or Vybz Kartel he said Shenseea write her own lyrics that is the proplem
shenseea is going to jail she two thief. gaza
the callaboration sounds much better to me. shenseea add a different style to it and it worked for me but that's just my opinion.
romiech too out a order
so if detta copy why fagtel no tek back wey im copy break im down u pussy face plaza fans u tink a flopcorn fishmarco fagylee are fasicka. it's a gully detta 🌎
some pussy face plaza fans talking about fagtel bill an break tell im fi break gully detta if im bill dem...looool
I knew shenseea by this Loodi chune,she has a good voice n sounded dope pon da chune too bad it was stolen
true it sound better with him alone a swear.. mi never like listen it with her...
U don't blame Shenseea, that managements because it's like she go steal the song iam sure it was handed to her and she just run with it cause it's kartel
why him neva come out and seh this earlier, why him wait till her version almost touch 10 mil views?
can't believe
prettyness is a thing😍 bwoy oh bwoy, it can mek yuh reach far ina a split second but when the time come fi yuh get expose that's a nother thing.
it is deception if they stole it and he should get paid
It bust her career
Carib fusion ur one of the only vlogers I know will get facts out of this story with a follow up and I really thing it's because of her manager's interview with ONSTAGE
DIslike cus its bieber
KOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL

Holy crap, your office view, nice.
When you said the roof goes down, i thought you were referring to the 488, havent seen that in a while also
Lee will the floor boards be removed (due to rust) and replaced or will they attempt to repair the existing floor?  Great video my friend.  (Mike in Ohio)

Lee you are one of my favourite actors. Excellent 👌👍
Just wanted to ask you champ how much will i need to rent 1
@ 6:17 So true LMAO
Beautiful place!!  Love how excited Hensley was to go on the bus. Too cute!
We just got back from zion 2 weeks ago and it was busy, but not too over crowded.  Do you have any issues with the auto focus for vlogging with your gh5?
Y'all really create wonderful videos treasures. Amazing family memories for your future, too.  Thank you for being so many people along for the journey.  BTW, what model of drone do you use?
your Grand Canyon vids have been excellent..someday I'll make it there...for sure! happy trails!
Nathan's face when those runners went by... 😂 I'm still cracking up!
Spectacular job sharing. Thank you so much
Don't be amazed or impressed with those guys running DOWN, I'd be more amazed or impressed if they are running just like that back UP!!! hahahaha
lovely sunset!
Wow!! That was a beautiful sunset. Actually, every view you showed today was just breath taking. I'm sure these pictures doesn't do it justice. Thanks for sharing, n safe travels.
Outstanding hole in the ground!
Great to watch as always
I didn't see it in the video, did you go all the way to the river?
A lot has changed since 1956! Those mules took up a lot more of the trail when my scout troop walked the trail!
You hit it out of the canyon. Nice job
all I want is just half of your energy
To be a child again and find excitement riding a bus.
Marissa looks like a MODEL, not a handyman!
Love the time laps those mules were hauling butt. Are you planning on going to the Skywalk at Grand Canyon West?
you guys are seriously making my husband and me want to get a small rv or something like that and travel like you guys and still have a place to call home for  non traveling times.
My favorite video!
Such a great insight into the Grand Canyon... but the best, really the best, was Hensley's WOW!  when the bus came... You have the most adorable daughter on the planet!
Always amazing videos!  Wonderful music!  Superior editing!  Great family!
I didn't think Hensley could get any cuter, but that hat did it!!!
Just started watching you all the other day. I have never seen a more adorable, cute little girl before!! Safe travels!
The Kolb Brothers Studio was neat to see  . Great hike guys .
There is nothing as beautiful as the Grand Canyon! When your title said "Then This Happened", I thought for sure you ran across a snake on the trail!😳😫🐍
Amazing, simply amazing. Thank you for carrying the cameras down into the canyon so that we can come along. I hiked one of the trails and went 1/2 way. I only carried in my trekking poles.
Love the movie y'all, Hensley you just melt my heart.  Great job. Safe travels to Zion.
Zion is my country. I would love to meet up with you all.  Let me know if that'll work.
From someone who will probably never get to the Grand Canyon, thank you for the beautiful videos and commentary. It is so fun to watch your amazing family share their experiences. God bless!
Zion , Bryce Canyon is our favorite in Utah .  Are you guys going to Glacier NP or Yellowstone?  Glacier is amazing especially Going to the Sun Road  Safe travels , I enjoy every video
You guys should see Bryce Canyon. Pretty amazing scenery and very different from the Grand Canyon.
Those runners were running DOWN. I wonder what happened on the way back up.
I really love your video's! Thank you for all the hard work you put into making them! <3 your video quality is great!
Simply Wow! Thanks for taking me on a hike I would never b able to do myself
Zions is awesome! I'm so glad you are heading to Utah. My home state. If you get a chance Bryce Canyon is a short distance from Zions and is equally as good.  Have fun!!
Beautiful scenery & great video! The Grand Canyon has been on my list for awhile now.
Your Mom is a really cool lady.  That scene is amazing!   So pretty.  On my bucket list.
Probably the people in shorts were Canadians... LOL. As soon as the snow is gone we are in shorts.
We loved Bright Angel, too. And I took a time lapse of the sunset from the same spot!
You have to realize the elevation effects you greatly
I've been to the GC twice, but I've never hiked down into it. I DEFINITELY missed out. If I ever get there again, l'm going for a hike! So beautiful!
Awesome footage and very well done by you two. Feels like being there again and now i want to return. Thanks so much.
what would have been a real wake up call is if those 2 guys would have lapped you. LOL
6:30 "Those guys were booking it."    They were also going downhill and probably don't have to support a toddler when they get home.
Before you head to Bryce Canyon watch long long honeymoon 10 tips for RV'ing Utah. They have great advice for Bryce and the other Southern Utah National and State Parks
I agree, best part are those special memories. Great video!
Thank you for sharing this amazing life experience with me!
Love your videos. What an awesome family 😊
do u feel awkward walking around with the camera?
Omg she is sooooo cute in her lil hat and boots!  Hensley in the Pink Boots!   Nice hike you two!
Another great video Nathan.
your videos are so great.
Marissa, The old man is sucking air you aren't​ !! What's up Nathan??😁
Marissa sounded like a Disney Princess when that squirrel showed up!
Look up the lost honeymooners of the grand canyons
Quick question - Mather Campground has a 30' max (Trailer + vehicle) how did you get in?
You don't have to act like professionals but rather you folk's really are. (Fact).  Love the vids done in good taste.
Your guys are super...I'm so glad to see so many "good" people in your travels.  Your videos continue to impress and your editing is right on.  This is the real America and keep on learning and enjoying yourselves.
When you go to Zion do the trail into the canyon awesome
Thank you for sharing your thoughts from your heart about your travels.  I love the bond that you have with each other and Hensley.  This journey with Donna is awesome.  Thank you again.
as a teenager I hiked the canyon rim to rim three times. Was a great time to remember.
An awesome video. Thank you for all the useful info. Hensley's rapid accumulation of vocabulary is astounding!
Thanks for taking us along, WAS AWESOME !!
Zion is so beautiful I'm jealous, you guys should be alright schools don't get out till the end of May or sometime around there... love watching your videos... you guys are amazing family...

On the two headed dog, the dog in back is between the owners legs, u can see part of the back underneath him
I had a dog that was the size of a bear. He had to live in my back yard. His name was of course, Bear. at 5:38

This is from the talko boo. copyright
there are PLENTY of strong girls in the world that can beat men. Common, common, sense.
Ya I want to visit that hotel
lol...look at the front webcam position 😂
Nothing unusual...
is this really coming out?
Is that... Alan Watts talking?
i wish i could be finanically irresponsible and blow my parents hard earned money on a samsung or iphone....  i stick to cheaper alternatives ranging around free and 300 bucks
yes, yes, yes
The phone looks acceptable but that dock looks like shit.
the camara is not horizontal but vertical !
so the curved screen rumor is over?
this would suggest that Apple has caught up in the innovation department. And that ended when Steve Jobs died.
APPLE IS DEAD R.I.P. STEVE JOBS
Thanks for including my music in this cool video :)
perfect *-*
no team Apple neither team Samsung.... Xperia is here... on 2012 i had an Xperia Ray which it has 720P display.. and now we're in 2017, and the latest iphone 7 (YAWN) uses 720p display.
lmfao. same shit. i phone highly over rated.
The music is so relaxing
looks great except teh camera location is weird lol
fuck yeah! they learned how dumb it was to go no AUX so they put 10 on the top
fuck that camera off i want to be able to cover it for obvious reasons
Alan Watts would turn in his fucking grave!!!! Capitalism at its finest huh
y'all do know that iPhone buys the LCD screen from Samsung right??
Apple is always the same youre tied and and and... samsung S8 rocks this year and Note 8 smashs  Iphone 8 :) trust me
I just hit the home button ahhh feels soo refreshing
who is the narrator speaking above all?
Hate wen ppl say apple steal ideas from samsung if only yall knew both companies have contracts with one another
Steve Jobs still turning in his grave.
oh oh... they forgot the ear speaker..  ah no , sorry you need to buy the new internal mouth speaker and glue it to your teeth
copy cat iphone😅😅😅# Sammy a lil day...now iPhone home button invisible
Well, i have only one question: How i will return a home page withuot the button?
Front facing camera inside a screen? Seriously?
That`s the only right way iPhone 8 should look like. Any other way will be fail, but if it'll look like this, I'll buy it, definitely!
where is reflections on glass ?
Really? "Game Cneter" app  and "Youtube" app not YouTube - not to mention Newsstand doesn't exist anymore, and Passbook is now Wallet...at least get some continuity going and fit it to iOS 10 standards...
Well, lets see what happens, beaituful concept
That white ceramic looking one is beautiful!!!
best concept I ever seen in my life!!!
all the youtuber who showed latest "leaks" i hated Iphone 8 but now i love it so much its so cool
It's Alan Watts not Alan Walls, give him credit and not someone who doesn't exist.
will likely switch from the note 5 to iPhone 8  but one thing gets me why does it say press home to unlock when there's no longer a home button to press.....unless the whole screen is a button 😲😲😲😲
But really is a beautiful phone
If Apple made an iPhone 8 it would be A iPhone 7 without speakers or volume rocker
iPhone edition of what?
Judging by Apple's current rate of iPhone evolution this is more like the iPhone 10 in 2022 nice concept but don't think Apple will be that generous take the iPhone 7 for example in Apple's slowing innovation
Not 100% accurate on leaks
this is really amazing!
Apple totally stole design ideas from s8
Looks....alright. Not going to lie I am not a fan of current "leaks".
This is beautiful ❤️
This real or not
holy shit, duh best wan rioooght here
awesome vid
I like the music in the background what is it 😍
I love it 😍
He's a fucking child. Thank god that ain't my president
the Anker was rude with the president. he deserve it.
This reporter will now be glorified....smh
listen to the liberal bitches crying.  i love every moment of it!
I have literally not heard a single interview with trump that was not a rambling incoherent mess.
why did you guys from the usa vote for him?
trump is a moron, but the reporter was trolling him.
spineless twat give me 20 mins alone with this cunt and he would resign
Man has no clue what he is talking about 😂😂
Why would he address barack obama as "president barack obama" instead of "former president barack obama?" complete lack of professionalism and terrible news broadcasting.
#bonoffgroup
fuck that annoying reporter...what a jerk off...look at his body language..i'd be like get the fuck out of my office NOW!!!...fucking jerk off lame stream media
Trump is weak and looks tired
if you don't like Trump, your the minority and all you do is whine.
Obama wouldn't even have granted the interview if the roles were reversed and Republicans dominated the media.
Trump is right about surveillance though.
America must be so proud
why didn't they do a mental check up on this guy?  he is clearly crazier then a roach that got sprayed by Raid.
What a pussy!
Everything that he does now is just funny
Fake News Reporter Is A Bad Sick Guy, Go Trump
To be fair the reporter was a bit of a cunt
there is nothing presidential about him
Fuck this cunt #yeezy2020
He's such a joke
This reminded me of Micheal Scott's famous quote: "Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way"
how the fuck did he become president
I love all the snowflakes ❄️ protesting in the streets , there helping his reelection . Keep it up please . Your tears taste great , Semper Fi MAGA 🇺🇸☝🏻👍🏻👌🏻
America is a hole
Hard to believe that fuk is president I'm just glade I'm not American
The worst part is that they're too many stupid Americans that dont realize that this man is unqualified to be president
1:22 that smile
https://soundcloud.com/6illmusic
Trump's a stud
It only takes one bullt
What? No, "you're fired!" This IS a reality TV show after all.
if trump actually does something about the nsa I'd be very suprised
I'm so glad I'm Canadian
This is what you voted for
He's pathetic
All these haters lol, just mad Clinton didn't win
I can't believe no one realizes how sick this man is.
How did this guy become our president?
This reporter is a fucking hero
a square in an oval office.
this some crazy ass shit
Trump is a moron.
LMFAO THIS GUY IS A FUCKING PRESIDENT I'M FUCKING DEAD.
LOL President of cry babies
very diplomatic obama was an awful president
Should have left in the part where he is pointlessly shuffling papers around like he is all of the sudden doing work
What's actually sad is that, the reporter was pushing to get that reaction, he would have kept asking about Obama until Trump ended it, and he did, fucking stupid news Network, fake news and stupid reporters
WTF he keeps repeating himself, The people that elected him are stupid and they are taking the US 300 years backward
The media is the enemy of the people 
The power people have the power disease.  The only cure is Care.  Be the Care today.
I want him impeachment NOW!!
Such an embarrassment...
4 words to comment about this video or to Trump, YOU CANT DO THAT !
Donald is jus blowin' off some hot air!! Whats wrong wit dat? :p
I'm welcoming you guys to Canada....
Hahaha "You can figure it out for yourself" He makes a great pet. Just pet him and give him treats and he will do tricks for sure :D
I wish the reporter stressed on trump about something useful.. like social service, people's safety, health, etc... trump you are awesome..you don't dodge.. you speak what you have in mind...
"I don't stand by anything." well there we go.
What a rude disrespectful little rat of a reporter. Undoubtedly a libtard.
"Why won't he just accept what I say?! What's wrong with him?!?"
"He was sick and bad" -Donald trump 2020
Donald Trump ran out of words and almost  cried. I think he cries alot in his office at night.
trump is such a bitch lol that was epic
What a retard. But I guess the people who voted for him are worse.
Holy shit he is stupid, what a fucking child
All you liberal cucks that have no idea what's going on. I truly feel sorry for you.
That guy was annoying. And Im sure trump did too.
DONT TEST THE DONALD
Proud to be a Canadian 👀
get out of here with your logic.
still cant believe such guy was able to become a president.
This is incredible how fucking retarded he is. How can you elect that shit. He doesnt even look at people when he speaks to them.
i've never been so glad i live in canada
way to go Trump! enough dealing with these ignorant media that brain washes the average American that can't t think for themselves!
So Obama can say bad things about Trump but if Trump does it to Obama it's a big deal? This is such a pointless grab for attention by the media.
hahaha ! stop talking about obama ! talk about meeeee!
İts not tramp its the fcking idiot reporter anoyin
America is fucked!!!!

this video inspires me to finally organize my makeup. more like my room. more like my LIFE!!!!
If your nose or throat is stopped up, a life hack is to put Vick's vapor rub into a ice cube tray and freeze it. Then take a shower and drop the cube on the floor and it will slowly melt and unclog you!
When you're sick you should literally sit outside drink a hot tea under the sun and sweat it out you'll feel better by tomorrow.
I'm sick 2 and using nose drops or a nasal spray gets rid of a blocked nose in 5 mins and lasts for ages there realy cheap as well hope I helps ❤❤❤❤

Get a gel lotion at Walgreens and it help you breath easer and not cough that much
Can someone send me the link to the face mask? Love you all!😘❤️
I heard Advil works for stomach aches and head and thought aches
Boil fresh ginger for about an hour and then add lemon and honey, it tastes a bit weird but it wil get rid of whatever you have.

Tea spoon of honey
Lemon in tea no mlk
a good way to help your voice when your sick is to get a spoon and pour in a bit of honey and lime trust me i am sick and it helps.

I liked the makeup organizing because I like to see what products you use.

MY MUM AND DAD ALWAYS EAT GINGER AND YOU CAN PUT IT IN A LEMONADE OR ON OATMEAL IF YOU EAT IT IN THE MORNING
I'm 90% sure you are related to Coyote Peterson
Wanna lose weight!?! Well now u can by going to the moon! We guarantee u will weigh less than your current weight! Just one trip around and u will be astonished
I bought those shoes. I ended up twisting my ankle...a lot...
just got a potty putt
4:52 the guy misses the basket
Lol this video had me LMAO! 😂😂😂
The pen doesn't seem so bad...
Is it weird I was cooking noodles while Matt was talking about noodles?
"Its sucks as it kuts", It certainly does suck!!!!
I thought the Shamwow was a dumb product. "It's just a towel" I said... until I used it. Damn thing took out the hot chocolate out of my white rug without stains! I was impressed!
Who else is going to buy the potty putter😂
The video was interesting. But you're still a piece of shit and I hate you.
Suna suits aren't a scam... they're made to make you lose water weight. If you know any about sports like boxing, mma, and wrestling, it helps the person make weight and they rehydrate after.
tbf the magnet pen was good for my aunt who's a nurse
To be fair, the neck pen thing would be extremely handy for nursing staff.  Though if that was the target audience the clock would upside down so you could just look down at it.
did you get scammed? a hair growing formula? it didn't work? you can't feel your arm? great it seems san-sational
Sauna suits are used by athletes who needs to lose water weight quickly before they have to weigh -in. But yeah it's definitely unhealthy and dangerous (especially if you don't know what you're doing).
5:19 - Never heard of a Dutch Oven, eh?
I bought my pot with the strainer lid in the store once and actually loved it. LOL
I hate that I remember almost all of them.
Oh my good golly. A guy named kuntz made the shake weight?! Holy shit. That's fantastic
no. 4,6,8, and 10 aren't scams. seriously Matthew.
Here's a joke... TV ADS LOL OMG KILL ME. PUT A GUN TO MY HEAD AND END IT!!!
"why can't they make a highly suggested workout tool for me?" the real question is :     "why can't they make a highly suggest hair growth tool for you?"
I was very disappointed with the potty putter.. Didn`t putt my potty very well at ALL! Totally got me off the green though..
I'm buying them all and sending them to Matt.
I swear my family had a Pasta Pro when I was growing up.
Oh come on Matthew, you yourself made a video mentioning DNP which as you said it: "you can literally sit around all day eating burgers and fries and still loose a ton of weight" in the top 10 craziest drugs...
I once met a person who believed in hologram bracelets and she seemed to be alright in the head. I have no idea what she was thinking, though.
Please don't use that happy go lucky background music again.
hahaha that last one
lol pewds bought it!
Masturbation booster
But when will your brand new video be released in central standard time? No love for the Midwest.
I remember those Power Balance bracelets. You can see almost everyone in my country wore one... I then felt surrounded by idiots.
omg. fat blockers and calorie blockers. check out layne Norton Norton you'll laugh
power balance 😂 thats like old jokes in my elementry school
Damn~, Matthew's sales talk is way better than those commercials. I might end up buying the product if he's doing the commercial...................
I actually bought a power bracelet long time ago and once believed it works. 😂
Matthew do you even know what the word scam means? You mentioned a few products in this video that do not fit the definition of scam.
fat trapper? What is that a rapper name for dunkin donuts best customers
what color where those kids you was dropping off at the pool Matt????hmmm?mm
ahahahahahahahahahahahhh WTF
All of them..
Bruh, the pootie blanket makes perfect sense. No one feels romantic in a stinky bed. ;)
Can we put CSGO Lotto (as seen of tv)
this was funny👏😁😂 i love watching videos📱 making fun of stupid products.👍💗
Adderall can make you lose weight. Not because it burns fat though.  It does it through destroying your appetite
My family actually had the pasta strainer. I thought it was pretty awesome, I always had a hard time pouring stuff into a strainer so this was a godsend to me.
You throwing shade at grav3yard girls new video? 🤔
We got the Shake Weight for someone as a gag gift, totally worthy the laugh!! Especially for people who've never heard of it and start shaking away 🤣
I had a power bracelet but than again it came free with my shaving set
I will say the pots with straining lids do save a bit of time but you can seriously get them pretty cheap without having to pay for the TV product.
I used the toilet putter one night wile had 45mins spare at work, Someone had it left it lying around within there office,  So I thought To Potter About Quite Litrally....
O no! I've spilled milk on my shake weight, well, I, gotta exercise any way
I know they were aliens and aren't real, but we need the adipose pills from Doctor Who, they actually worked, and the adipose are really cute XD
The background is darker than my past...
If a fart ruins you marriage you were gonna get divorced anyways.
But does the Copper chef work? That is the real question, it has that ceramic tech non-stick coating. Square Pan design means 25% more room! No bit seriously does that one actually work.
my mom got one of those bracelet things. yeah they do jack shit
love the editing. that editor of yours sure deserves her paycheck
your heart was not in this. the work shows.
I just wanna eat food off of Matt's shiny bald head.
the sauna suit would be a good item to have in your bug out bag lol like a wearable reflector blanket.
Call the number at the beginning, it's worth it!!!
I remember  about belt. where it supposedly give you a 6 pack abs in no time l.
I love how incapable of taking care of themselves people look in those commercials
"there is no pill that can make you lose weight" Didn't you do a video that had a drug that could do that but it cooks your organs?
Soo did anyone call the numbers? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I wonder if Matthew has any bloopers/outtakes from his videos. Who would like to see that?
Shameless subtle plug haha.
Wouldn't necessarily call all of these "scams" but I still enjoy your vids
Wasn't the Shake Weight on South Park?
I would have brought one of those pens
or you could be watching this video
I bought a potty putter for myself a few years ago and still sometimes use it
unsubbing because of your shirt
Once i got a vape pen that costed 4 euros for 40, it broke after an hour..
actually matt, i used lipozene for about 3 months and lost 75 pounds. got pics to prove it too. was 265, now I'm 190.
i dkond iny think
babita bhut smart h
chalu pandey and jetha lal are good actors.
Why cant they write and direct stories like before. Why such silly stories with lax direction
Guys I swear I just got.$2154.free.money from this amazing website: (just type in g00gle)=> *_freeppalmon xyz_*
Holy shit the viewbotting
awesome video!!!
Hahaha, my son Eric has the same bed! the white one from the right, it's from Ikea isn't it? :) Great video!
i don't understand why you record your child crying for views, that is horrible. my kid will not be watching and Idk why anyone let's their kids watch this knowingly.
asked I was widow imperiled like skidoos
You search" family mouse" on youtube. . There will be surprise..
it's not a good thing to climb out of the crib 😾😾😾
Great video!! Don't cry baby :))
...as my Sofia )))
Nice video :)

Thought this was a gaming channel, these are vids we'd normally see on the main channel
Who else is a true Panonian? 😂😂😂😂😂
00:1 who has had the new guardians of the galaxy green Dorito #supernova flavour thumbs up if you have
You guys should play actual volleyball. I feel like you would be good at it
EPISODE 2 PLZZZZZZZ
Love this channel x
You should play tomorrow ball
This has to be the most butchered game of spikeball I've ever seen
Do more gta troll vids
this is like four square
I'm so confused isn't this supposed to be a gaming channel, all of the videos are normal main channel games and collabs
3:05 yo Wolfie flew. The way he jumped killed me. 💀
i came for wolfie but it was ryan
hey guys autisticminer here      funfact:i love fidget spinners
Did anyone else see that Ryan looks fatter
At 3:23 did anyone else see that Big ass dog😂
I got this I'm under 3 secs
bring back sexual readings!!!! like this if you agree! #OGparodians
where did he get the game
Lets be honest Wolfe try's too much and thinks he's cool he's just cheesy
Where did u get that spike ball set thing
Why does it say gaming channel in about tab but no video games this is a challenge channel
Please do more
HATE DORITOS BUT STILL THUMBS UP
Anyone else realise Charlie is playing this in SANDALS
ryan's body is so weird Haha
Squad goals
Bruhh when I saw the intro about Doritos I was eating them at the time
wht a truckshot
Who else noticed that David keeps puttig at the start like it says like you you love something just to get likes
dj is not going anywhere in is youtube channel
David always has the gay outros and songs in his vids.
David I like this game so litt
I don't know why but when David ran to go get the ball I couldn't stop laughing
Charlie looks like a nba mypark rookie
P-p-p-p-play KanJam
it's not a DavidParody video without a build up to a bass drop (6:17)
David is the goat what a play 
Where can I buy this
At 3:44 David hits the out side of the trampoline
I am actually eating doritos and watching this video
Thumbs up if you like saracha
Spike ball, I luv that!
There is a 10.0000000002654422221256789000% chance this video is awesome there are 100% chance u didn't know there was a letter in it and a 100% chance you just looked at it again realizing there was no letter
My stupid principal made that
Deej is black(1) and ryan is lightskin(0,5). Which makes it 1,5. Wolfie is lightskin(0,5) and David is ASIAN (ASIANSENSATION!!!!). Which makes it 1,5 Mil.     Not fair.
The title should me  "WE PLAY SPIKE BALL" instead of all that clickbait BS with challenge and trick shots
Anyone else notice that big ass dog in the background at one point
Subscribe to Me, Jeffrey Chiu And I will Subscribe to U My YT: Jeffrey Chiu YT
At 3:27 did it hurt dave lol
Bro wtf is this game Canada has some weird shit... ay? Looooool

Thumbs up if you like Doritos😂
Swaze- yep, we're here, we're good, yep , nice, we're good, yep, we're nice , we're here
This game reminds me of 4square
I swear at the start when david explains the rules he says if the ball touches the rim of the net the other team automatically get a point.......6:21 did that not touch the net????
6:23 but you said no hitting the ring 😬
I love this vid plz make more
Strategy is to go low not high!!I know how to play this.
I'd like to see more GTA trolls with Team Alboe, those are funny! 🤣
That low key looked mad fun. Past 2 please
4:02 i didn't wanna broke the camera
i can't buy doritos in my country so i never tried them
I just realized now at the end of the vid that Ryan and Deej are wearing white tanks while David and Charlie are wearing black T's.
Have team alboe sign that and ill buy for $500      Have swaze sign it and ill sell it on ebay for $0.01
4 monkeys hitting a ball on a net

Why did i just watch 3 black dudes and a small asian lesbian play some weird game
Y do u use the budget spike ball
Sick last shot Dave 👌
i play this game at school i love it
Why does charlie look like a giant ahah
definitely a part 2 to spike ball
who thinks davids video quality has gone down?
I who else didn't know the teams until half way in the video
im not trying to hate but im kind of mad because he should be uploading this on his main channel and videogames on this channel that defeats the purpose of this channel to play videogames. sry (not a hater)
I really want to see a part 2
Dave was the best
Snapgang bro keep making banger videos you are the best!!
You should do one of these again
Will Dan Stevens marry me?
So *"Star Wars meets Gamer meets Hardcore Henry meets every other movies with that hole in te sky"*, dont take me wrong I still watch it...
A VR movie starring you and Dan
Wait, another Dan Steven movie?? Dayum, what movie is he not starring in lately? I love it. :D
Is this on blue ray already?
oh look, a giant blue sky beam. never seen that before.
So is Legion's new super power to be in every single  movie and tv show there is?
not killswitch the game, no hellicast
Hardcore Henry was cool... i think this is going to be cool as well.
This year is going to be very gud.
This should be 3d just a idea
This looks great
Plot twist: This is all in Legion's head
what graphic card arw they using
Stevens kind of looked like Chris Evans in this trailer.
Quicksave:  The Movie
Hardcore Henry 2
Reminds me of the Deus Ex: Human Revolution ending
nice Inception BWAAAAAAAAAHMS
I can't tell if this is a big budget blockbuster or a movie that's only going to be shown in like three theaters across the country. With Dan Stevens it could really be either one.
Is this the call of duty advanced warfare dlc?
I smell a bomb
What a shitty trailer
That mysic though...  Aesthetically pleasing ear orgasm
I have no idea what this is
So sad when you watch a trailer and just know its gonna make like 20 bucks at the box office
Looks fuckin awful
I remember this X-Files episode.
Hopefully they jack into the game like in Ghost Machine.
The did the people who made infinate warfer think they were gonna do next? well....here you have it.
Hey it's the guy from beauty and the beast
Is this the band killswitch engage
That sound is just the worst sound. It is the national headache inducing sound. And also Dan Stevens is hot as shit
Did coridor digital make this?
Prince Adam tf you doing mate.
Half-Life 3?
I will support anything Dan Stevens does 💗
Half-Life 3 confirmed
David can u hear me?
Wait a minute, is that the guy from DC's Legends of tomorrow? You know, that guy who plays the captain and dies and is secretly alive, but brained washed. Ya know, that guy?
Wait don't kill Switch, I just got Breath of Wild 😧
first 20 seconds could just film Dan Stevens face...
Where is Christian!!!!!!
I know it only has Zelda but c'mon it'll get more games eventually
that starting music is cancer, I have heard it way too many times from almost every sifi movie trailers
Stop the Inception horn crap in trailers.
FUCKING YEAH
we're actually getting another one of these...
Is this Half Life?
So now they want to make their own Hardcore Henry just with Sci-Fi? Come on.
My nickname used to be MrKillSwitch...Awesome
I see dan Stevens i click on the video
Looks to made by the "What's in the box" creators?
daamn.i thought it would to be something like a film "Guest" but there something like a shit(maybe its not)
ummm hy was there a hunter seeker from terminator wtf.
if the movie comes out in June why don't we have a longer trailer.
wasn't killswitch a proper video game?
loving the new mass effect andromeda updates
skyline fleshback... oh no
its basically Legion fighting aliens
Lol why make movie of Kill Switch?
Bad CGI - even for a movie that is trying to portray AR CGI.
god damn it another found footage piece of drek
is this base off the video game??
Like a watered down Hardcore Harry.
After watching legion I swear I'm starting to see Dan Stevens in everything
Where have I seen that beam of light to the sky before?
Hardcore henry 2???
BRAAAAAAAM OVERLOAD!!!!
Hoooollyyy shiit, "What in the box?" 2009 became a feature movie? 0_0
That's right go ahead kill that f*cking Nintendo Switch!
looks like shit :) :) :)
Is this from the video game?
Saw Dan Stevens, immediately clicked on video 😍 but in all seriousness, this looks kinda cool. Can't wait for the actual trailer 😁👍
did someone say flop? :3
So this is a higher budget syfy version of 'Hardcore Henry'??
Dan stevens everywhere 😂
Is this some kind of hardcore Henry ???
Will watch cuz LEGION
I am a simple creature; I see Dan Stevens, I click
I hope the gameplay is solid.

Why is Gunther so cute and awesome
Can u guys do a video with super Mario Logan aka sml
Things I hate  1. People whc can't spell  3. People who incorrectly was counting  2. People who edit their comments.  4. People begging for likes  Like if you agree
I have the same dryer. xD
why are there kid videos in the suggested videos
The title for this should be changed to. "Elmo's White waters torture."
These videos are amazing I can watch these all day
What type of dog is it
when Kermit threw Elmo in the pool he sounded like morty from Rick and morty
Is it me or did elmo sound like a car locking
when Elmo barked it reminded me of a car XD
where do you get the kernit puppet
Lol i like that last clip
This is so cute my vagina just exploded, AND I'M  GUY !!
wait but kermit never went for a swim
I honestly love these vlogs much more than the gaming videos you did before. They're fucking hilarious. Now all we need is Jigsaw to be in the vlogs.
I swear I get an orgasm when I see you
coming  to  my  house at 5.00   AND CALL ME THIS IS 512-897 - 9952
Gunther is so cute

Put kermit in there
I wanna have a Threesome with elmo and kermit :)
Throw  kermit in the poll
What breed is Gunther?
This is pimp my setup
we got to see the real Terry Crews and I like him
Make a video of you playing some games or live streaming!!
Why not Ryzen WTFFFFF
can it run crysis?
Oh man, there is a very serious bro-mance going on between Terry Crews and Jayz.
I know price was not even a consdieration but any chance you will share the final $$ with us?  You know, like if someone wanted to buy a PC like this?
What desk is Terry crews using ?
@jayztwocents next build for UFC champ Demetrious "Mighty Mouse" Johnson??? super cool dude and huge gamer.
22:59 #SAVED
22:59 He was about to give him a hand shake but he tries to cover it
how much does it cost?
one word...  wow!... hahaha (y) (y) (y)
They should have thrown a thousand miles reference in there, it's my favorite Terry Crews moment.
'Museum quality'? Settle down Crews, just wait 12 months for Nvidia to release the next Titans and then it'll be museum quality.
Terry will be calling Jay every week for some tech support.
Best video on youtube PERIOD.
i have $3 - what can i get for that
Finally! Great build and great reaction. You'd better present a PC while eating yogurt😀
JAY TWO CENTS I LOVE UR VIDEOS. RESPECT BIG HELLA LOT RESPECT. ONE LOVE BRO.
what was with that stupid unfunny prank?
next up is a a-team truck themed pc build for mr.T
What if Terry Crews actually acted all this out xD
If terry made a youtube channel on gaming I would watch the shit out of that.
"i can live a lie"
A work of art it looks like to me. Excellent job on the PC, Jay.
So how much were parts alone?
this pc is epic! <3
How much cash did this cost? 15000$?
i cant wait to see Terry on Steam, i hope he plays CSGO or Rocket League, like he's gonna be Global or Grand Champion
he looks so happy!!!! POWER!!!!!!!!!
So all I heard you have two xtra titans available. I'll work for one!
after i submit this comment im taking a baseball bat to my rig
say us things for DOOMFIST
I think you've just brought some new spice into Terry Crew's office...
is this a good pc to play black ops 3, l4d2, and older games simaler to those ?https://pcpartpicker.com/list/JTVnqk
I hope he integrates well in the gaming community :D
Lmao A FERRARI WITH A $199 SPECIAL MAACO PAINT JOB I BET THEY ONLY PAINTED the exterior, jambs, dash, and rear shelf still that turquoise from 1958..
Is this a good 1500$ setup https://pcpartpicker.com/list/YpGXBP
is that Austin Evans in 1:47 (car side-door)
JayzTwoCents makes Terry Crews look kinda small lol.
What case is it
Pulls up the cove it's just a computer covered in old spice stickers
PU PU PU PU PU PU POWER
now please voice over watch I beg u
i got a nightlight too......
i would say that terry crews is the single reason that white chicks got any ratings at all
Hey Jay, Pimp My Pc...
damn that mf bad!
Great work JayzTwoCents I love Terry Crews aka "Cheeseburger Eddie".  Nice build way to raise the bar!!
song 7:30 8:20?
T-Pain streams some Overwatch and stuff; I guess you could make him a rig too.
man this pc has a lot of...       PPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Guys is this graphic card they used  the best out there ?  What about GTX1080 ti?  It would suck if terry crew won't be able to play 4k at max performance ...
All white lights,white is elegant,thats why I don't use rgb,only white.....sounds like a minefield,u r brave guy
great pc, im just torn on the hard drive sticking out like that. but its really a great pc!
cool video found out about you randomly with terry, enjoyed the ride def will be sticking with you man, respect.
what kind of monitor does terry crews have?
I'm happy to see Terry into pc gaming
With all due respect, I would rather have the Bell and Ross watch on Terry's wrist!
The same wallpaper I am using as Jay at the last, coincidence............
only gamers knows the value of this.......
that Star Wars wallpaper though!
w8 xD he has a power button on there that doesnt work ?
like the meat and potatoes isn't actually impossible to get for an enthusiast to get.goes to show how slow pcs are moving nowadays.add the case and the custom stuff then yeah you get an expensive build.
missed opportunit. a custom liquid reservoir looking like an old spice bottle would have been awesome.
Any footage of you building this ?
Classy room, complete with a Herman Miller Aeron chair! That is a good way to spend a grand on something to sit on... LOL
ASUS X99-E 10G WS Motherboard.
15:44 dat moan tho xd
how do people dislike this?? this is amazing!!! Great job Jay
haha he's about to cry
Dude! Terry needs to do some let's plays, streaming, or something with his new machine!  I'd watch!
Is that a real stick of deo or an empty one? Amazing rig.
But can it run Crysis?
Jay this build is amazing! The only thing that could have made this just the TINIEST better would be if the yellow 'Ferrari' LED strip was the Bearglove sea green. :) AMAZING build! It's beautiful and I love it!
Somebody should do a show like this. Some sort of West Coast Customs for PCs. They customize everthing and at the end of the show they present it to the celebrity.
The details are way better than in Rolls Royce cars.... Best looking PC in the world!
Smh I hope to God he had to pay for this PC damn $4000-5000 PC custom made and that's without labor cost wouldn't surprise me if he got it for free on top of the fact he makes milllions a year
This is basically a fuckin Old Spice ad...
You are such a wonderful person T.T
1.07 views 1.04 subs lol
Great PC, and the whole thing is ruined by the stupid attempt at "funny". It's just a commercial for Old Spice...
Why only 32 GB of ram.
Jay, you have the most awesome lounge I have ever seen. I love the reclaimed wood style ceiling. Very nice.
Ruined the video with the shitty prank tbh
bruhhh I am having the same thing
Carl's Jr./Hardee's hand scoop their ice cream, it's good there
Your having a midlife crisis @nadeshor
Bro, let Joe know the transition music is fucking loud af

Great Vlog.. Enjoying the Golfing.
100 Thieves hat on the course. Only Nadeshot lol
SmashBurger
Breakfast the most important meal of the day
Come on nade what is this content, I used to be a big fan but bro the content this past year has been so bad bro, gonna have to unsubscribe....
5 minutes talking about a fruit loop milkshake, what's next? matt's poop review?
Come to Oklahoma we get them like once a week
still feel like you pick up on the ball. Do you have a ton of topspin because of it and top the ball sometimes?
I like whatever video you upload Matt! Keep going!!
You should do a full blown golf video. All 18 holes
That's the golf course from gtaV
Your such a slacker when it comes to vlogging 👎
soooo if you dont eat your fruit loops with milk? how do you eat them? Just plain?
What happened to getting your car wrapped again?
Golf is lit
yo fam fix that unibrow
nade buddy when that massive quake comes you take your camera and make the most killer vlog we will ever see <3 <3
I love those Lenny & Larry's cookies! The peanut butter flavor is the best! Great editing btw!
when you're so desperate for content you have to settle for a milkshake review
where is the cod WWll reaction?
Damn, that was a shitty ass vlog.
Who's that black dude
Bro your content is starting to suck ass.
why the caps lock on the title lol there's no need
love the golf videos Matt!!! keep it coming
Nadeshot i swear your edits are the BEST
Damn BK has gotten hella trust from nade after the red velvet Oreo shake. Also the shoe game is too real in this vid
Says it's really hot outside at 75° lmao. Try 102° at 9am where I'm from in the summer....California has made Nadeshot soft.
It's hilarious how much Matt tips his head forward to promote the 100 thieves clothing. Subliminal messaging.
Carl's Jr. Makes their shakes with ice cream milk and the syrup. Lol
Nade the type of guy to call in sick to his doctors appointment😂
Your content is trash lmao
I had the milkshake last weekend. Very sweet, but still good! Worth a try for anyone.
Justin is the piece of shit that tried suing a 16 year old kid
You should try and play golf more often mate!! at least once a month or so, dont wanna lose your touch lol even though youre nice!!
you remind me of bill burr for some reason. are you a fan by chance
nadeshots guna sell his series to viceland and fuckin BOSS UP watch.
this is what happens when u have no content ideas, fucking Burger King click bait lol
Why does he look like a white steph curry?
I slept through an earthquake once
Steak and shake has the best milkshakes
song at 6:00
TELL JUSTIN TO MAKE VLOGS AGAIN!
Great another food review person just what we needed.
Not too bad of a swing!   You got potential if you stick with it!    I'm liking the golf vlogs though!
So you telling me this the gtav golf course? Looks similar
I don't get the whole season and episodes....
did he really just censor his video?
Post rainbow!!
Love the video man! When's Rainbow Six coming back? Missing it..!
Most boring video I've seen on YouTube today. Couldn't even make it to the end which is rare for me..
mother fucker using training wheels on his putter lmao
I had it a few weeks ago. It was bomb.
You're prob bringing in tons of 60 year olds with this golf footage.
i get a lot of earthquakes here in New Zealand
hey I'm a fellow golf bug. Would love if you came down to Vegas and we could play some courses around here
Nade the type of guy to kick someone from optic
Fuck I don't know whats going in in Australia but we pay 5-6 dollars for 10 nuggets.... and it's fucking $1.50 for 10 in amecria fuck I need that bro
Yo my dude nade, if you love Naruto and DBZ(which I know you do) you should check out Hunter x Hunter (2011) and My Hero Acadamia. I guarantee that you will love at least one of them.
I tried that Fruit Loop milkshake last week. Straight ass. Red Velvet was much better
You've gotta get back to focusing on your vlogs, man. This wasn't even really a vlog. We enjoy when you put in effort and post at least every two days, not once a week. You don't need joe tbh
this man got food and a drink from chipotle, and then got food from burger king and a milkshake... fat ass lol
Nadeshot the type of guy to not use milk in his cereal
Nadeshot looks like a crackhead now
Golf? Lmao tf is this nade? Are you feeling old as shit?
Don't think you wear ankle socks on a golf course 😂😂
fucking uplode shit is stupied some h1z1 with big T
Nade.... Bro... Come on now, no one gives a fuck about milkshakes or what they taste like, you haven't really uploaded a great vlog since you all went on that trip in northern Cali and stayed in that giant cabin
Try the orange cream shake from arbys. Awesome!
Steak n Shake
You got to step back a bit by talking naturally and not like you're endorsing everything that you're doing. Haha. Like your vlogs though but that's just what I noticed.
nade still with that ugly blue wrap...
these vids are boring af
how is 75 degrease HOT.... where I live that is freezing
Dude first you stopped gaming and now idk what you even talk about anymore in your vlogs. I have been watching you for a lot of years. Bring back the quality!
nade tehres a place in new York where its a nike shoes shop and a ice cream place they mix icecream with cereal and shit.
The only thing I got from this videos, is that Nade doesn't have milk with his cereals. & I can't stop thinking about it
Coming on holiday to la this summer and that earthquake freaks me out. If youve seen san andreas you know why.
They added froot loop syrup
How sweet, a Tim Hortons mug!
All that effort and you didn't show us the actual coffee 👌🏻😡🙄
whats the name of the song at 13:20??? Please!!
Girl I slather that Olaplex on for AT LEAST 3 hours gotta get your monies worth when the bottle is the smallest thing in the world.. overnight sometimes.. ya feel
Love the little Aslan bite at the end 👌
LOVE Backstreet BOYS
What. I seriously can't believe that Aslan don't know of the justin timberlake meme? For gods sake, it's eeeveryywhere in late april/early may. Everyone posts it??
MAYSTEE......YESSSSS!
The convo aver BSB and N'Sync .... priceless!
I love a good cleaning day! tie your hair up, sweats and an apron, and go to town. the entire Internet knows about it's gonna be MAY! Aslan, come on.
I JUST did the same kind of spring cleaning yesterday! Feels SO good.
Estée took the words outta my mouth when she called Aslan "Bill Nye" 😂😂
I spotted the creepy cat at 8:39! =D
I didn't know there was an audio version of the Economist! My boyfriend gets and reads it every week. I always think I want to read and get smart but its so hard to read hahaha
OMG ! I LOVE THE FAMILY PHOTO!!!!
Beyoooooond excited to have you in my life everyday this month!!!
also 7:48 the creepy cat on the floor! still remember when you got that gem! :D
NO HATE But I think it sucks that she keeps putting vlogs on this channel even though she asked for our opinion and the Top Comment on her last vlog on here was to put them on the Everyday Estee channel....
this is my birthday month AND you're vlogging?! what a treat!!
haha u guys are so fun to watch. very much life goals. chillin and vibing with yo homie bae and doggie ! hahah love it.
anyone else love hearing the water being poured over the coffee? relaxing!
your makeup collection is very reasonable for what you do! :)
Where is your marble vanity/desk for your make up from? Love it xx
Put the portrait video up, Aslan!!!
I am excited for #Maystée 🤗 I love your vlogs even if it'll be vlogs of your typical day.
Awww I miss your vlogs! The family portrait is beautiful. Will you still post videos on your everyday estee channel?
Whats up with your vlog channel ? No more videos ? I might as well unsubscribe there if you post all your videos here.
"I keep them tucked away, because I never wear them"  *whispers* get rid of them
NO HATEBut I think it sucks that she keeps putting vlogs on this channel even though she asked for our opinion and the Top Comment on her last vlog on here was to put them on the *Everyday Estee* channel....
i'm a barista and i didn't even know all the coffee lingo aslan said lol
Loved this vlog! Please do more decluterring vlogs xx
What is she using while filming? Like a special eye lense or something like that?
Hello everyone! I just started my own channel and I absolutely adore Estee. I would really love it if you could take a few minutes to check out my first couple videos :) lots more coming soon <3
Have you watched Pet Fooled on Netflix? It's a documentary on the pet food industry that really opened my eyes. It's only an hour and ten minutes long.
you have a lovely home, really enjoyed this vlog x
Your makeup storage is soooooooooooo coooool~Can we have a makeup and skincare collection video?💗
This didn't come into my sub box?
Anyone who's missing the Wisteria Lane?
I've had one of those pour-over coffee devices for almost two years and never bothered to find out if there was a "correct" way to use it. Now I know and I'll need to try it!
Oh yes I'm excited for this!! Hehe Regs eyes when he eats get me every time!!
Estee you can just throw away the coffee ground to a pot. The plant will love it, and the ants will stay away from the plant because they hate coffee.
The Line of Duty is awesome! Also how great is Bill Nye Saves the World. Blow it up! Haha!
omg I literally had to show the "It's gonna be may" song to my boyfriend the other day as well lol. He knew the meme but not the song.
finally vlogggsss!!:))
omg put the portrait video up! it sounds amazing!
like your casual style very much. comfort is the first priority.
also wisteria walk in HP
You really shouldn't hang knitwear :)
What is in the Asos bagggg
Esteee you beautiful
I LIVE FOR YOUR VLOGS ESTEE! Ps. the quality is so good which camera do you use if you don't mind me asking?:)
more reggie content please!!!
Don't throw the coffee away! Use it for your plants! ;)
Estee, are you using a GoPro? I think i am noticing things are looking a little different :)
I said "it's gotta bei may" to my work colleague and he didn't get it. Never been so upset
Try conditioner for shaving your legs, it works amazing. I think it's so expensive to shave with this oil, I love to use it on my body instead. Wow by the way where is your vanity/dressing table from?
Hey there Estée, what type of food do you feed Reggie?  Would you guys share the biscuit recipe you made for him?
I know it's a weird thing to say but your lips are beautiful. your natural lip color is literally THE BEST! aaanyway love you<3
I can't wrap my head around online food shopping. I mean, I love going to the grocery store, to me it's like walking through paradise.
I've been missing these vlogs Estée - great to have them back for the month ! Hope to see you sometime in Copenhagen <3
HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF "IT'S GONNA BE MAY!!!?"
Have you abandoned your vlog channel?
Stoned af watching Aslan make that coffee was the best thing ever
My birthday is on the 1st of May! In Malaysia it's labor day and is a public holiday. It's my first year of working full time too. So this birthday is extra special ☺️
The whole vlog  was so Estee and then the coffee tutorial was to die for....
Small concentric circles.
Im so freaking excited for all the vlogs coming this month it's ridiculous 🤗😁 love ya girl 💕
I'd like to see your perfume collection, Essie!
Watching Allan make the coffee was amazing!
New appreciation for coffee.
For a beauty blogger your collection is really modest. That's a good thing! Where did you get the containers?
I love seeing the vlogs again!!!
That coffee ritual was money
So random. But where did you get Reggie's dog bowl structure? That is amaze. My pup / mostly me would love that.
"Hit me with some more phrases!" 😂I'm never sorry I watched one of your vlogs!
The bioderma shower oil is very good for shaving! And it's pretty inexpensive
Yay I have   missed you vlogs!
oh my god. i  miss vlogs like this!!! i love the homey feeling they give off !!! LOVE the photo in your office too!!!
I can tell when you're feeling main channels downstairs but I feel like you used to film in another room ... Other the The current office .. Unless it used to look a lot different ?
Which camera are you using?
I love your vlogs! I just got my hair cut, I asked to have it cut just like yours, and I love it!!!
Get one of those vaccum bags so you can save your blazers for the future and still keep them "fresh" and out of the way
What is the wall colour in your kitchen, Estee? So subtle and pretty...I love it!
Yay! Can't wait for the next one 😄 The portrait is very beautiful! and so is this video 💖
Watching on my lg g6, so. crispy.
i like how they finish the video, it was all blue and down, but that last sentece got me back to earth
2:35 isle of flightless birds?
Anyone else think it's absurdly overly optimistic to think that humankind will live long enough for us to have to worry about finding a white dwarf to live by
how can heat death occur if energy can't be destroyed? the energy will still exist somewhere so naturally shouldn't we always have heat energy?
All the white dwarfs in my neighborhood work very hard, but all the black dwarfs are on welfare...
Make a video about dimensions pls
technically stars are born so the universe cant die unless they stop
wait what about red dwarfs which ones last longer, red dwarves or white dwarves?
Ok time to find new universes or new dimensions
I swear this channel can make anything kawaii as fuck
new video? YASS
This is very sad.
Ashen one, link the fire.
People is making questions about the universo, but first of all were is the univers growing :O
iv been waiting for this one!
That's racist!
this man dropped a mix tape?
well that's my black metal album name sorted
+The Batman Highest quality channel indeed
We all die.... Repeat..... Dinosaur in a planet.... Dies.... Humans.... All human history thingies... Dies... Repeat...
just commenting because comments increase your trending or something :)
Wow I thought this was little people Atlanta vs little people Hollywood?!!
I find it so depressing that even the universe has an expiration date.
what happens if 2 ion spheres collide? do they fuse? do they still have mass? i think it would be cool if the universe just somewhen repeats and starts over
I like how Kurzgesagt managed to end the video with a happy note in interesting and slightly depressing video :)
this video almost gave me an anxiety attack ... Fuck this, fuck dying and fuck being an atheist, Ima believe in some god shieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
waited 8 months four this lmao
this is so depressing 
In a nutshell... we need to access a portal to other universes....or a time machine!
Here's the message of the video: "Reality is cold, unforgiving, and horrifying. So don't think about it.". Ah, rick and morty philosophy.
Moar pls moar
while the storytelling and animations are well done, we still don't really know what is going on in this place we call reality and how it truly works, much less what all this will do in such a timespan.
"If you need an excuse to delay work a little bit longer..."  THEY KNOW
plot twist! the black dwarfs turn evil and destroy the whole - wait.
an I thought the Sun was whit dwarf, it is not  a yellow one, so what is it then?
WOT IF HES LYING ,WOT IF WE DIE NOW????
We made a Discord chat! https://discord.gg/8aNwc8a
finally a new video
Maybe the last natural source of energy, but if we ever survive that long as a species, probably we will be able to make or own energy, and maybe our own star.
By that time, probably we would find a way to create our own sun
What if humans could absorb all of the heat the the sun produces and use it as energy?
God really didn't think this through. Creating the universe and all. Isn't he suppose to be all knowing? CREATIONISTS!? ANSWER ME!!
How can we not be sure that a cosmic ripple... a quantum event of sorts can replenish the energy source?
I never thought I would feel bad for a star... poor iron sphere
I'm so glad I don't live at the end of the universe.  Can we start finding tunnels to other universes now? Preferably one I could design myself like in Myst.
call Aurelion Sol no?
What happens to "time" when all those stars are just little dense balls of coldness? It is proven that time is tied to gravity. Does time "accelerate" then or does it "slow down" or what?
Wait, what about the weird crap in the bottom of the sea? That literally get no sunlight.
Very knowledgeable, great animation and has good commentary skills. Will be subscribed to this Chanel until the universe dies( so il be around a while)
Trump will make the Universe great again.
universe Travel methods please this theme :/ :)
You should make a video about Yellowstone's underground super volcano.
I find this video exceptionally optimistic.  I needed some happy :)
It got rather depressing towards the Heat Death stage, fortunately the ending brightened the mood... XD
Maybe we can find a way to cheat our universe in billion billion years and prevent heat death ... I would hope .
Don't worry, the simulation probably would have been stopped long before then, because it would be too boring to watch.
Finally! Thank You!!!!
Its funny how sure seem about the universe dying, like it's a fact even through it's a theory.
Please do something about biologie
This episode was crazy good thank u <3 :D
And here i am praying to die, when i could just blow up the sun and kill everything
That's cute, you think humanity will survive to galactic dominance, we won't survive each other's greed, lust for power and affinity for violence....
Who dislikes these videos? I mean SERIOUSLY WHO? AND WHY?
We must rekindle the fire.
Fantastically depressing, as always, well done!
I have been waiting for this ever since seeing the red dwarf video!
can't wait ..............
Sadly inspiring. And optimistically terrifying.
If you could theoretically slow or stop universal expansion, Could the universe possibly exist forever?
Watching these science videos makes me sad and depressed...
what is your next vid going to be about
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS EPISODE SINCE RED DWAFS
hi i have a vid idea can u talk about the pros and cons of conunissum
Really interesting, awesome animations, thank you !!
Ah Kurzgesagt, always so positive, believing we are gonna exist long enough to use white dwarfs as energy sources. Thank you for having faith in earthly life-forms.
Poor people who will have history exams at that stage of our civilization.
I love these videos, they always make me seem smarter in Science and History class than I actually am
This was depressing yet adorable
We will prevail for an eternity or die trying.
Now, I feel the knowledge..it...is...LIT
So what happens when the balls of iron collide? Won't that eventually cause everything to happen again?
tardigrades. how would they be affected?
Hopefully Futurama predicted the future and after heat death we just have another Big Bang and recreate the entire universe over and over again for eternity.
Makes me think: we will never unravel all the secrets of the universe...
aaaayyyyy!!! with that cleaning mix! ok guuuurrlll i see you. that suavemente is my shit to clean. lol

A secret wood guitar body could be awsome
A cake stand out of..... cake? No, cupcake wrappers/liners
Don't know how I started watching wood turning videos for bowls, but I really enjoyed watching that the result looks really good!
Just realized you were taken off my subscribed list.
+5 speech in this vid
dang, I wish I had a workshop like you have.
Labyrinth pun. Love it.
That's so incredibly cool. Subbbbbbbbbbbbbscribed!
What would you sell something like that for?  Not looking to buy one, just curious.  =)
Awesome Video! And nice hat!
LOST WOOD PEN BLANK!!!!!!!
That would make an awesome bowl for my weed
really creative and artistic! cheers from Brazil!
i subscribe to the king
Or perhaps in Slytherin, You'll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means, To achieve their ends.  From one house member to another, that was spectacular work.
I am without words
That's beautiful. I wish I could order one!
You sound like the light brown beaver off of angry beavers.
Looks cool. I can't help but think you should find a way to make a void in the middle to keep from wasting some much resin.
Beautifull!!! I like it!!!
outstanding  wish I had a lathe
looks super cool! good job man
Is polyester toxic like risen 
Hey peter, you should cut it with the circular jig first before you pour the blue resin and then wrap cardboard around it, that way you use less resin and it's all ready to turn.
looks great
thats pretty awesome
that is beautiful!!!
sub just for labyrinth ref 😂
is resin food safe?
Labyrinth reference wins. You have a new subscriber
This man loves his resin
I notice you use a lot of resin I was wondering how expensive it is war if you buy it in bulk
that is beautiful!!
This makes me want an entire set of dishes looking like that.
will you please make resin shoes. please
are you happy using polyester resin on this project ?  How is this bowls condition now? big thanks for sharing this process.
bonitooo. super
Nice bowl! Is it safe to use for say cereal in milk?
As usual I love your work Peter!!!
Thats Gorgeous!  I love it. I want to learn to do this. just to make these bowls.
Shop therapy!!!  WE ALL NEED THAT!!  Keep up the great work Peter!
that's alot of wasted material. couldn't you have cut a semi sphere out of the inside of the block to make a smaller bowl?
WOW I love it, so beautiful
Why would I keep my bowl a secret?
Awesome work! Greetings from Argentina
How come you don't mix in the dye before the catalyst? It seems like that would give you more time to mix the color in evenly before it starts to set. Just a thought! Been binging your videos. Good stuff.
I have no idea how I got here, but you have a new sub :)
I have no idea how I got here but you have a new sub :)
BEAUTIFUL!!!
You are fabulous!!!!!! I can smell all that wood all the way from Greenwich in London UK
it looks amazing! You mentioned you have kids, I hope you teach them all of this I would have loved to have a father who would teach me cool stuff like this
Peter "Resin King" Brown ;)
well...I can think of about 100 other projects to use the Walnut on... it was a waste of gorgeous materials.
Looks very cool.
This is GORGEOUS👏💜 lol and your voice was fine and its obvious you had a great time with your family!!!🙌😘😆
WOW what a fantastic bowl, at first i thought thats crap as you were making am so surprised at how beutiful it is xxx
Omg that is super cool makes me want to go out and buy a lathe right now
..that was totally cathartic. LOL.. yes I like crafts for the exact same reason. Most women knit. I hate knitting.
What lung protection do you recommend for working with resin? Is it the same as when turning/other activities that aerosolize things you'd rather not have in your lungs?
did anyone else kinda just gasped when they saw him wearing a slytherin cap? cause i did....
That is my favorite color of blue. I love it
what a wast of resin, why did you not make a round blank.Even then you turned away 90% of it,???????
I can't believe how beautiful that looks. Just fantastic!! Nice job!
Yooo how would a red to yellow like fire look
That bowl is fire
It doesn't appear that you use a pressure pot but I've seen others peoples videos where they do. Do you just not record that step or is there a certain type of resin that requires it to be pressurized?
12:30 Top left hand corner.  Dam look how many sponsors he has .
my god that is so beautiful..
"Bog of eternal stench" love your labyrinth reference
Sorry I'm new to this, but you added 30 drops of catalyst. Is catalyst like hardener? If not, what's its purpose and do you use it each time you make a resin?
omg! thats beautiful work!:)
GORG!! Love it - Well done!!
that came out pretty good. your in socal?
Wow! That is impressive mate. Regards Mike.
Looks amazing! Just found your channel and your work is stunning.
I love you so much "it smells like the bog of eternal stench in here" from the labyrinth that is the best movie ever
wow, i would bye it.
this would look amazing as flooring
these wood scraps ..... i did a small cup with one piece    and air was in the scrap  and u can see it in the resin when dry   how u get it out  when wet
11...12...29...30 hahaha.
I want this I need this Olan stop making all these you are just going to make us want them to be real shows. We need this to be a show too now.
YUUUUUUUUSSSSSS THIS WAS AWESOME
speechless olan
This was wonderful! Can't wait to see what great things you bring next.
ANIMATION IS CLEEAN AS FUUUUUUUCK
THAT PLOT THO!
What the heck Olan ur videos are the only thing that can bring me to tears!!!!😭 U r such an amazing imaginative creator!!!!!❤️
i need moooOOOOORRRREEEE
Reminds me of Boy and Robot
looks awesome, but will it be an adult cartoon, or intended for younger audiences? It seems like a combo-ish thing.
Olan this rocks! I get so excited for everything that comes out on your channel and you never disappoint. I can't wait to see what comes next 😊
ROB NO YOU!!!!!!!!
Creepy as hell, Olan! lol Still awesome but the end freaked me out.
words cannot describe how original and creative olan rogers is
THOMAS!!!!!! It has to be TG, right??.... has to be....
Ok but the end is what *really* got me, like woah
omg this was really good!
I love the way you tell stories. How are you so good at creating awesome stuff?
This is really good!!!
Can we all agree that we would watch this?!
Gore.Thomas!!!!! Yes! Shock Treatment!
If anything more comes of this, you must promise us that Detective Boy will, at some point, say the words "nutty buddy".
odd how we know who the villain is but you know what? Screw it! Olan you're the best! I bet if you asked the fans for a few million dollars they'd give it to you!
THAT ENDING HOLY HECK
I love it all! And that credit sequence is kick ass!!
I wasn't ready... I just wasn't ready man
this looks amazing!!11
How did you even find time to do this. Appreciate ya !😝🙌
That ending tho.... My mind is blown
I hope this and all your other cartoon plans are huge successes Olan!
OlanRogers I am so happy for you! This is so good! I can't wait for the rest of this and Final Space xx
Oh man... Olan, this looks incredible... I really hope something comes from this.   For that ending theme, is there a full version I can check out somewhere?
That was only 6 minutes and you already made me care about these two- how???
I need this
Holy crap this looks so freaking good Olan.  😀😀😀😀😀
well, I now have a new show to watch if this becomes a thing.
Olan, how the heck to you keep taking something so fun and silly and making it give a man goosebumps and tears? I love your storytelling abilities! Keep up the amazing work!
Olan only your creative mind could come up with this awesome idea
That was fricking awesome!!!!!!!!!  I cried dammit!!!!!
YOOOOO! THIS CRINKLED MY BRAIN!
Whatta twist
HOW ARE YOU SO GOOD AT COMING UP WITH CARTOONS!?!? THE FIRST ONE HASN'T EVEN COME OUT YET AND I'M ALREADY EXCITED FOR THE SECOND!!! DON'T DO THIS TO ME, I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL 2018, IT'S TOO MUCH!!!
WHAAAAAAT OLAN MY MIND IS BLOWN
HOLY CRAPOLI, I CANT WAIT TO BINGE THIS!
Duuuude that song tho! What is it??
So cooooooool. I had some real Big Hero 6 vibes in the middle, but that's good because that movie is awesome. And the ENDING. Freaking PLOT TWIST.
Your uploads make my day! Loved the video..can't wait to see even more. You're so creative & talented :D
This was beautiful! And also, the robot Rob gives me some 11th Doctor vibes. Is it the bow tie?
this needs to be a thing
Oh my G! this show looks so dang good!
I can just imagine Olan's face as he speaks the kids lines. :)
This was so freakin cool. I loved your scenes in The Matchbreaker.
*HEART BREAKS* I love this...
o shiiiiit that was real good!!!
DUDE this needs to be a show like on netflix or something
wah! super awesome!
I love this!!! And I love final space!!! I can't wait!!!! This has to be turned into like a series or something! Please!!?
Olan, you are one incredibly talented man! Congrats on all your success. You deserve it!

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! I am so stoked to see more of this. I had chills the whole time. Sharing with everyone I know  I NEEEEEDDDD the ending credit song!!!! Help me out Olan!!
This needs to be a Show!

Seems really cool actually just maybe have someone else voice the kid
This is amazing and I love it❤️
This is so good!!

Madness a yard!
My reaction to out of state license plate Me: . . . INTRUDER!!!! KILL THE OUTSIDER! KEEP THIS STATE PURE!!!! *slams the gas*
In Florida it's:  *car cuts you off* Me: Dude WTF *looks at out of state license plate* Me: Fucking tourists
For my dad and brother it's half like this, except rather than talking they punch one another for the fact that it is a game  Dont worry they get along fine
This is mundane as fuck boiiiiii
I'm intriuged by "stupid" shit like this too lol.
I live in Alabama lmaoo
30 second add for a 16 second video... worth it for you
I love how when it pauses his eyes are pointed in slightly different directions.
Ok but I live in a very small souther rural town so if I see a New York license plate, I'm flipping the fuck out
Check out this website https://multitaskenterprise.wordpress.com/about/ to fix your credit score and other financial matters
wHY ArE Ur EYes LIKe ThaAT
0:09 the eyes are looking opposite ways
2 things 1 I live an Alabama and it gets boring as shit here, so it is very likely that they're just escaping to do something for once. 2 it's good to know that this isn't just me.
I live in Toronto. that's is how I am when setting a American lisense plate
Unless that other state is Ohio, in which case your instant reaction as a Michigander is "oh, I'm supposed to hate this person's driving, right?"
So where's the Punchline? And why does his face look like two blobs eating each other?
You never know how mundane as fuck the next thing that happens will be in the mundane as fuck zone
And yet we all went against his will
He reminds me of some kind of animated character from a 90s cartoon anybody see that too??
Why Does He Have Two Eyelids On Each Eye?
I once saw a guy with a licence plate that I thought was costume but than remembered that Nunavut Lucent plate was a polar bear
I'm crying.
I'm sorry I gotta know. WTF does a NY plate doing in Houston Texas?!
That's so freaking me!😂😂😂 I tell my brother *Oh look he's from Maryland that's pretty far and cool how they drove up here to Boston*
THIS MAN IS BRINGING BACK VINE
Literally me
I bet most of everyone also thinks: "Damn I better not be stuck behind this car they will be cautious and drive the speed limit."
this guy looks asian af
..............        .....What the fuck did I just watch?!?! Is this mychonny brother or something?!?!
lol I started to realize that when I took my license out
Once I saw a license plate from Europe. I live in America. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, I was on vacation in Spain.
Wtf is this relatable shit? Subscribed.
This is me but mainly because I live in the middle of the ocean so seeing a different state license plate is pretty insane.
AHA AHAHAHA AHAHAHAHAHA FUCKING NORMIES RRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I'm a random mundane as fuck comment stroller...hi
I have never hit 20 likes on a comment help me And yes I know what I'm saying is cancer
That's a weird way to spell high school.
ur fat and funny 2 things that go together = sub
I do that too, but then I realize I live like 30 minutes from Disney World, so they're probably here for that. :u
*hello guys it is my goal to get 100 subs before my before my birthday on April 30! I will sub back to all of you, just reply*

How dare you roast me like this
Love how you don't feel embarrassed by being who you are and what you do. Keep it up! it's really good stuff :)
GO F K YOURSELF YOU FUCKING ASAIN can't drive f r shit in your fucking flash cars
the plural word for a goose is geese, so wouldn't the plural word for moose be meese? #realworldproblems
How did he get the twilight zone voice
Tuscaloosa.
Oh my god I love this video I would love his Chinese mouth around my d*ck 😝😓😰😰🤣😛😜😏😏😫😫😫😫😫 hottest person of the year award goes to this chubby asian
I am quite triggered by this video.
love his video editing skills.
Fun fact: Australia is surrounded by water       Bet you didn't know that Ohohohohohohohohhoho
*crisis intensifies*
Like or comment if this was reccomended to you. It was to me.
sub for sub??I did it plz
that is in fact not the state that we live in XD
🤣 in Australia we so can relate it sounds racist but that's what we do (if we out don't get it... for SA and VIC people who cross the borders are called "Mexicans" its a joke I'm gonna get hate ain't I?)
I saw a license plate from Antarctica... I live in Australia....
No one......Fucking.....CARES
LOL my husband sent me your video because ever since we travelled with the kids YEARS ago, I start a new list of provincial and state license plates every spring. A little OCD about it.
You are so gay
I once saw a license plate from canada ! I live in Quebec
I'm the 1000th comment...     what am I doing w/ my life...
Holy shit for a moment I thought it was rod serling's voice o.O
this isint fucking vine
but how do you react when it's really far ones?  like Alaska or Guam or Texas when you're in the upper midwest?
Mundane as fuck
I saw one from california, I live in Maryland
"that is in fact not the state that we live in"
everytime prozd say the word fuck i get turned on, even if it's just the word "fact"
NEXT TIME ON TMAFZ
My reaction is usually along the same lines except with an added, "GET OUTTA MY STATE" afterwards for no reason that I can think of.
I feel personally attacked😂
where are his eyes looking
I live in Ontario and saw a Rhode Island license plate. so I thought "Rhode Island license plate! you never see those."  lol that movie was hilarious
wtf is this stupid shit?
I don't get this
M U N D A N E
I once saw a Nunavut plate in Florida.
Hi from alabama!!
250,000 policemen on £300 odd a year, who are they hiring? ameobas?
Soo very cringe!
This cat must have way more than nine lives.
Does anyone listen to LBC? I hadn't even heard of it until today, and I've been alive 33 years.
I don't know how she is in such a high position when she sounds so stupid. Why does she not know what she is saying when they even sound incorrect?
Can we not please? eugh,..... I shudder each time I hear this.....
Labour is a mess
this is so fucking painful to listen to, how the hell is this woman... wait, never mind, nothing from labor surprises me any more.
This is a key policy, and she has no clue. Remember that. For goodness sake, vote Tory and don't let this shower anywhere governing our nation.
She sums up the whole of Labour.  Absolute clueless bunch of people.
this is exactly why you shouldn't vote labour
You know, I think there's an illness that causes sufferers to see numbers flash across their field of vision randomly.
Such a racist wicked old hag
For fuck sake. Just fucking admit you don't know instead of trying and failing to bullshit your way out. Absolutely ridiculous.
What a Cnut!!  I (we) are paying for this stupid Woman, non elected but STILL paying. PC gone mad.
This is a Mensa level Riddle. Normal folk will be unable to comprehend.
The thumbnail is killing me. That's why I'm here.
She sounded as if she was making it up on the spot
After listening to this twice I realised that the interviewer is just trying to make her look like an idiot. She knows what she is taking about it's him that's he muppet.
I will NEVER vote for Labour, they personify incompetence. At least the Conservatives know how to run a country like a business and understand success. Labour are for losers.
they will cost.... they will it will cost......they will cost.....about. i need a tumbleweed emoji. pretending you know is seen to be apparently more important than accuracy or honesty
People voted this into power?
Dumb as a box of rocks!
God she's ugly...
Alright, she made a mistake with her figures, and fair play she probably deserves some ridicule over that. But cast aspersions over her entire career, over this simple mistake, is a bit of a stretch.
What an absolute idiot! Let's all be MPs and get 60K per year for talking complete bollocks!
Unfortunately, it is true that eventually many people get promoted to levels higher than their competency.
This is what is wrong with this country,  f**king idiots like this...
Diane abbot isn't a car crash, she's a 12Km long pile up
Labour is dead...
Cambridge University educated!!!
you won't hire them all at once so the calculation isn't as simple as this / this
Good God she dumb. What on Earth has happened to the Labour Party? Completely unelectable at this point and I can't help but wonder how badly they are going to lose in June.
I think she's a few beads short of an abacus!
Is this secretly colossal?
Imagine her on Dragons Den lol she'll get roasted. Sounds like a pitch at 2:22!
The cost is irrelevent because labour has a magic money tree.  A.K.A borrow on the nations credit card and Tax Tax Tax.
Think she needs to go back to primary school to learn basic division.
See this? This is why The Heartless Tories Are winning.
THIS IS FAKE NEWS, We all know DIANE ABBOTT is Jacob Zuma. Go search for JACOB ZUMA Numbers vídeo ...
This is an amazing riddle, but rest assured the cost will be amply covered by capital gains tax...now as for Dianne's maths and economics GCSEs they will be covered by pixie dust.
1 2 miss a few 99 100 i can imagine this is what was going through her head
Pain pain painful cringe OMG corbyn get rid of this mess
Fuck LBC for taking advantage of someone with Down-Syndrome! Don't they have no shame? Poor woman.
It's literally worth voting tory just to stop this woman from becoming home secretary... and I've not even started on her fuck-buddy corbyn.
Oh good Lord! This is just painful to listen to… 😖😖
Lol one word comes to mind...embarrassing
Hopeless. Stupid or what? How do these people get into these positions???
how the feck is she a MP. She's  moron.
She's just high on crack and fucking ugly at the same time
These were diificult questions: she did well under the circumstances.
RETRACT THE MATH RETRACT THE MATH!
it's a shame the labor party has a good few dribbling idiots because it could be a good party without these few.
She's as stupid as she is ugly, what an absolute mongoloid
Rest in peace labour, what a joke of a party
Pathetic labour MP
She needs to stay out of the media completely. She will lose them the election. Shocking stuff, our country is a mess.
what a moron
I can't stand her. She has this incredibly patronising tone. Such a shame this is happening, the media will take every chance they can to show labour in a bad light, and this really doesn't help.
Racist, Zionist bitch. She does NOT represent Britain. We want National Socialism NOW
lol how can she say "i think you said that" she is only in her position due to the race card i swear she is mad out her depths
*Black lives matter*
*Dumb shits ruling over the smart. Typical world we live in.*
dunno what's worse her or the wig
this is why no one votes labour  apart from left wing students
Diane Abbott, dont think I've ever seen anything good come from her
Haha a 16 year old school girl on minimum wage could do her job and do a better job haha
what a Muppet
Absolute fucking joke. You've lost my vote for sure.
what a fucking retard
the term she needs to use is "police officers" not " police men/women", has she never watched hot Fuzz?
im not racist I've got 3 cousins who are white because you see I'm black you assumed I was white because of my coments I would like a reply but I guess your to embaressed to I would think
I'm not racist I've got 3 white cousins because you see I'm black you thought I was white because of my coments that sums idiots like you up I would like you to reply but I guess your to embaressed to I think
Hopefully they have a skin to replace that god-awful Leto-inspired Joker costume
That's Joker
acts like joker but doesn't look like one... will take time getting used to
this joker for me is bad ass
he has the same moves from Injustice 1
Why does the joker look like angsty teen cosplay?
I honestly did not like the joker's art. The 1st injustice was much better.
Are the other 9 slots on the website the DLC characters?
song please
He can be alive becase of Lazarius lakes, but who and how got his corp there?
LMAO CAN U IMAGINE JOKERS SUPERMOVE ON DARKSEID 😂😂😂 how's he meant to fit in the chair???
wow he looks like justin bieber dressed as a joker in halloween lmao this is justin bieber guys 😂😂
My favourite character of DC.
He even dies the same way as Jason Todd
The only character whose super move hits the user...
Was hoping Troy Baker would voice the Joker.
I'm no Jason Todd  gets beaten by a crowbar
Whats the Music Playing in the Background when there showing off his moves?
Graphics look amazing. huge improvement from previous game
He's got Heith Ledger's face with Jared Leto's style
I'm calling it, Red Hood is DLC
You know DCEU and WB... you could easily fix Jared Leto by making him more like this...
Who the fuck keeps designing The Joker purely to sell hot topic merchandise?
He looks like a greaser.
Jeff the Killer wanabe...😡😒
What's Max Landis doing as the joker?
This guy gets more and more demented in every reimagining. Looks good
This joker has the hair of Heath ledger Joker and the body of suicide squad joker
Now rated M for scenes of suicide and listening to good charlotte and having a 12 year old girlfriend that has four different Harley Quinn shirts.
Yeah he looks like shit
could you just later on buy a dlc character you like or could you only get dlc characters with season pass?
He he! It brings all my family memories back... and all because of the laughter!
It's like they splice Heath Ledger and Jared Leto's Joker and you get...well this.
Everyone complaining he looks too "emo." He's the JOKER. He wears face make-up with green hair dye. Does that not already appeal to being emo?
Is he single?
Here'a a saying "You don't bring a sword to a clown in a fight, he'll think it's a bad joke"
The joker is now a hipster??????????
I love me some edge
Thats not the Joker, thats Dante when he went through his "scene" phase growing up
Wait, how is joker alive
include these two and i'll be happy - Green Arrow and The Joker
The fuck does Joke think he look like with that hair?   Skrillex???
He looks like that quiet kid at the back when everybody is dissing him but he has a sawed-off in his bag.
Its like a mix of Heath's joker, suicide squads joker, and the old mark Hamill's joker
Way too much laughing... transition between moves look jarring
Why does Joker look like an teen going through an emo phase?
I think I hate the look of this Joker just as much as I hate the Jared Leto one...  What the fuck developers?!
The more I look at it, the more I like it, honestly. I just want to know more about what Earth this Joker came from.
this game looks like trash.
What happened between the games...?
Joker wouldn't win either of those fights.
I'm actually one of the few that likes this new Joker look, but the voice doesn't go with the look. They should have gotten Troy Baker to voice Mr. J as this Joker appears to be younger than the previous game..
Is it just me or does he sound like Sheogorath from Skyrim
Meh, not a huge fan of the direction they took his look. Too much Jared Leto.
Uh, that super combo isn't possible because it had a meter burn move in front of it...
I don't care how awful this joker looks... I won't use it anyway...
why is joker back he is dead andthat is not the same joker from tge good universe cause harley killled him so how is he even here
now I want spawn to be as a guest character for injustice 2
He looks like a crackhead and a clown at the same time
take my money!!!
his face reminds me of the actor from first spiderman
doesn't sound like mark

you guys think Batman healed the joker? 🃏
Looking for people to train with and join my Injustice community on PS4. Add me if you're interested. PSN: Shxbaz
Has anyone else pre ordered the digital copy on PS4? If so, is tour also saying it'll download/be playable on the 14???
well this joker is new
wow...they are putting The Joker in this game...I am sooooo surprised.....
Why am I waiting for the (Not) Joker to spring into a rousing rendition of "You spin me (right round)"?
The Joker and the new robin have one thing in common, they both killed a robin xD
The Joker and the new robin have one thing in common, they both killed a robin xD
Joker received the DmC Donte treatment. The worst are the people who are actually defending this pathetic design.
why does joker have all the same moves except for one, come on joker was one of my favorites but now he's just a copy and paste with a new skin
the look is little different
Why is it jokers hair defines him?
HAWKGIRL PLZ
this game looks worse than the first one imo
Joker: Forgive me for my wrongs I have just begun.
OHHHHHHHHH- big smoke
im really hoping for Richard grayson aka nightwing to return
What Happened to His Iconic Laugh and Look?? They just ruined him :(
All these people just hate and are terrified of change. This joker definitely looks interesting.
Appearantly if you have long hair and is combed to one side, you're considered an emo.... welcome to 2017
What's up with that hair? He looks like a emo Joker cosplayer...

That movie you were talking about, about the grandparents being killers is called "the visit"
Damn so you we're in WI? Thats's where we're from.
my hero is back
Hey look its the same gods that failed to kill all of that darkness
Man jacks anger is scary jack is better off without him
When he said "EARN????????!!!!!!!!!"...... I lost it LOL
Samurai Jack is Back
And magic! His original skin tone is back with the sword!
I liked him better with a beard.
Well scaramouche is fucked up big tiime
"The rays on my chest is a baptism -I'm born again."
I want to give a hug to everyone who's worked on this show so far.
Everyone says they will miss the beard but honestly I hated it so much
Here's a thought. Is Jack going for the Aku of the future or from the past???  And also, do you think he's going to the guardian that gave Jack a thrashing before sending him off on the winged red beast.
THE GONE BEARD IS SOMETHING I CANT FORGIVE
Thx for uploading theese
So... Jack's been wearing a Spirit Armor the whole time?   The whole fucking time? That actually explains why it just comes back.
dude omg I'm blown away!!! solo good I only wish I didn't have to wait for more!!!
Wait, so the Gods gave Jack's Dad the Sword and a bitchin suit of magic armor, but Jack just gets the Sword and a haircut?
2:49-2:54 gives me a weird, tingly feeling. Like a shipping vibe. I don't know why, but I love it! Also Jack is Back boys!!!! And Samurai Beard will be remembered.
0:17- Nice to see that "Paxton Fettel" here is still around...XDXDXD
jack is back!!
he shouldda kept some of the beard
another great episode. thank you for putting it up
It would be so awesome if Jack ended up with his fathers armor during his fight with aku. the armor his father wore when getting the sword in the first place
1:26 NO! I! DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😠
That's fortune cookie nonsense!   I LOL so hard at that moment!!
Remember the episode where scaramoush wasn't allowed to get in because of a no dogs sign? And when he waa granted access he was eventually kicked out by some dogs?
So if Aku supposedly destroyed all the time portals, he must have came across The Guardian. Will that episode with the Guardian even be mentioned as canon?
2:00 I never had my eyes wide open and yelled as much as I have in this moment... 😱😄😃
this show is amazing!
Awwwww, I'm going to miss his beard and flow.
How many of you edge lords are on here ?
Orc : ouchhhhhhhhh
if jack got his sword back, does this mean the old intro will come back like the intro from the past seasons?
holy crap!! he gained 1k subs in like a day!!!
Who else was fanboying out of their fucking mind and yelling "YES! YES! YES!" at the screen when Jack was transformed into his classic self and got his sword back?
Damnit genndy you give Jack his motorcycle his samurai armor and his damn beard back right now the old Jack does not work in this season
1:22 *Balance Drug*
Now Jack IS Back!
like how ashi just bluntly points how he instantly has no beard and his hair shorter
I miss his armor
didn't jack meet the Ra one before, when aku was trying to control the beasts of Set.
Why are the Indian, Norse and Egyptian gods in cahoots with each other?
So is Ashi gona get her own weapon, other than whatever is on the ground?
Hey you can go watch the full episode on my channel!
i feel like he is going to kill aku in the future (present) then fight the guardian to go gain entry to his portal then go kill him in the past forever destroying aku ftom time
you know what , there are some animes that were made for smoking weed , this one has to be highly ranked in my book easily lol  ((d-_-b))
for a man having problems for killing 3 goats and 6 wmans jack is pretty okay with ashi killing an army
Shit's about to get real
I need to learn how to just meditate a sword into exsistence XD
I wonder what the new intro will be...
Jack's Rebirth inspired me to begin working out again d; and keep a clean shaven face!
NOOOOO NOT THE BEARD
The way Jack says Ashi name makes my heart flutter😍......I'm a sucker for romance xD
For the people that say that Mad Jack has a point 0:17, then you are consumed with anger.
Everything's amazing and cool, but... I really liked how he looked with a beard. He could get a haircut but leave his beard
Easily my fav episode in this season
I understand now.......
Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Cartoon Network welcome for the one and only Samurai Jack! (2:13)
The secret ingredient was balance. You're welcome.
YEEEESSSASDFGHJKLKHF FINALLY A HAPPY ENDING!! I AM SCREAMING LIKE A LITTLE GIRL RIGHT NOW!!!
what happened to the portal guarded by the Guardian? was that destroyed too?
before this the new looking kinda grown on me
question. why didn't the fucking space gods just finish what they started?
Anyone else find Ashi hot?
Well, at least that silly beard is gone now.
Watch out Aku, Jack's back.
Ehh not a fan of Jack's transformation
finally got rid of that stupid beard
Plot Twist:  Ashi's mother is the Scotsman's wife
Watch out now, Aku you son of a bitch! He's BAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!!!!!
Guess who's back back back back again jack is back tell your friends
A bit rushed but I still liked it.
Not all the portals were destroyed , remember the portal guarded by that massive blue guy?
2:22 Man! That was awesome! Ashi was that awesome or wha- oh shit.
dang, that transformation at 1:51 .. that's the first time in a while that I've seen them be uber-lazy with the animation in a part that really deserves some love
So what next ... AKU ohhh SNAP
They missed the golden opportunity to make Ashi reuse Jack's line "I like your hair, and your dress/robe."
1:22 THOT *D* *E* *T* *E* *C* *T* *E* *D*
I wish God would beam me some clothes and a haircut.
So "Mad Jack" was basically telling Jack what to do during their adventure?

Not abandoned anymore. There is a serious effort afoot to rebuild the park as Jazzland and the owners intend to reuse as much as possible. Hence the heightened security on site. Not a good idea to go anymore.
25 hour challage just do it!!!

his voice omg russ is my drug
the first 30 seconds resembles Miguel quite a bit in my opinion

It sounds like he wrote the hook first, new it was hot, and then wrote the verses after. Just doesn't flow as well IMO. But that hook is amazing.

Good guess by gp n vani asking kathir scene was excellent.Nice episode.
I think the doctor is the one that blackmailed saravana
Go on, Surya. Do what every normal person might do when they're confronted with a lusty stare from a creepy old guy. Spit at his face and call the cops.

Vaani Rani in God's own country.....wooohoo!
DAVID LYNCH IN DA HOUSE
*IT IS HAPPENING AGAIN.* *IT IS HAPPENING... AGAIN.*
That gum you like is going to come back in style 😱
Who is the person at 0:07?
THE SHOT WITH COOPER, THAT'S LAURA STANDING BESIDE HIM!!! I'M SCREAMING
omg! Can't wait!
I'm so fucking wet.
This is - excuse me - a damn fine teaser.
Oooooh yeeeees ! Cannot wait 
Re-watching the original now. Getting really excited for May 21st.
OMG! I got goosebumps!
Guys, who's the guy on the bench!?
I'm so stoked, but I can't help but wonder how new viewers will see this. I hope there's an amazing new mystery to rope people in
Who is the second one ??
Twin Peaks - Geriatric Park
Yes, really.
Whoa i just realised alot of people died
And yet Agent Cooper hasn't aged a day in 25 years
YAS!! i was shit scared when i watched it, now its coming back
I skeeted, and then I squanched.
How's Annie?
FINALLY we'll find out...how's Annie?
I wonder who that is next to Coop. Looks like a blonde...
That's a damn fine trailer. Too bad there's bo Pay-TV down in the Sarlacc.
That show we like is coming back in style!
I still can´t believe that this is actually happening.
How's Annie?
This looks like it was shot with a DSLR from 2010? and the cinematography on those shots looks like a 1st year film student. My hype has diminished considerably sadly  :-(
Please please please please please let it be good...Let's rock.
BOB WILL KILL AGAIN!
It's like coming home.
Give it to me already! This wait is killing me, and I don't wanna die before that gum I like comes back in style!
Seeing Cooper with the Black Lodge pin in his lapel is sad and depressing.
At last! It is happening again.
How's Annie?
Everybody's hair's a little whiter... except the one who should be.
I won't even make it past the bird sitting on the Douglas Fir branch before I start crying on the 21st.
Seeing Grace Zabriskie as Sarah Palmer wheeling her cart down the alcohol aisle and eyeing the bottles just about broke my heart!   I'M SUCH A SUPERFAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CANNOT WAIT!
I wonder if we'll see some deputy Andy crying scenes, like in the original.     xD
Grace Zabriskie (Sarah), Ray Wise (Leland), Sheryl Lee (Laura) all should be nominated for GG or Emmy finally
Actually like that it shows the town as older. Can't wait!
I have absolutely no idea what the episodes are going to be about, and I love it!
The only piece of dialogue we've gotten is "...really" and my hype just doubled
Finally some footage ahhh I'm gonna die. Already like the look and feel just from these few short seconds of shots.
My nipples are hard right now and I am not even a female
WOW BOB WOW!!
After this i jizzed in my pants
The Book House Boys Ride again
I just noticed but Sarah Palmer is really eyeballing that booze
goosebumps all over. It really is happening again.
God I just came all over the place
WHERE IS AUDREY HORNE
If I get any more excited I'm going to need to be hospitalised by the 21st.
I'm not embarrassed to admit I just teared up a little watching this
It's all very cool, but please do not show more new footage! I wonder if Lynch agreed to show these.
Simple but so effective teaser trailer.... Im all hyped up now!!
Some might mistake shots of Lara Flynn Boyle for footage from the movie Mask
So glad they are all back
HUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHH!!!
0:21. Agent Jeffries: "now who do you think that is right there?"
Slight Horrorgasm. Can't believe Harry Dean Stanton is still kickin. He'll be 91 this year!
Harry Dean Stanton will live forever.
I feel like my hands are hacking back because I can not wait for Twin Peaks !! God's ...
Fucking Chills <3
Wow Dave Wow
OMG... my favorite series come back!!!
Just want to grab Grace Zabriskie and hug her. How can one actress express so much pain?   Awesome. Yet heartbreaking.
Oh... Koops...
Finally some footage from a new season, I really believe that it will be a great comeback.
new footage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a miracle.
looks so good
Wow, this is actually new footage!
I've been waiting 25 years for this.
HALLELUJAH, this is how you hype people up!
Some of your friends are here
Wow, Bob, wow.
holy crap it's happening again
This is the epitome of a cult classic
Where Michael cera
I don't know how this comedian lives with himself, dying night after night  on his own stage
What previous life is he talking about? His previous life as a snake oil salesman?
Of course its hard. I'd love to see these know it all comedians run this country. Then it'd be an even bigger joke
"I'm a details-oriented person," says the same man who admitted to not reading Executive Orders before signing them and doesn't believe in facts.
JACKSON WAS UNHAPPYABOUT THE CIVIL WAR....LMAO.....FROM THE GRAVE
"that's so easy!" 😂
Hilarious video ... but one question ... who is that a picture of at the end? If thats Seth Myers then I have no clue who Seth Myers is.
seriously.... mix your volume higher... how is late night with seth meyers the lowest volume youtube channel.
spoiler alert! lol I love Seth Meyers
One of your better ones, Seth.
I like how the host doesn't bother to introduce himself.  Who is this guy?  Is this 'closer look' a real show?  Is this fake news?!
When real news feels like you're watching late night lol That reporter holding the map LOL LOL
Cause he never thought leading a country would be hard...
"It's so easy." "Very easy." "So easy." What a fucking parrot.
You couldn't write a comedy as good as this
how has he not been impeached?
He said Iraq (instead of Syria) because I seriously doubt he gives it much thought to distinguish one country or their issues from another, and lacks empathy.  They (and us, in the USA) are just props for him.  Awful!
Sounds like we are living the movie monster vs aliens at so many levels.
I just learned he doesn't DRINK .............. I just asked myself "How the F***K does he say what he says???".............. anyone knows the answer. Please guide me!!
Come on guys give Donald Trump a chance,  It's not his fault he's completely retarded
Ye we are save      For now
I don't know the true historical facts so, let's lie and make something up for my ignorance followers.
Well trump is sure stressed-out probably like he said being a president is hard work
TRUMP FOR 2020!       And he's going to win! Again. I can't wait to see Miley Cyrus cry again. HILARIOUS! 😂
Like the Civil War "soldier's letter."
He is such a flipping wimp.  Actually an ass.  People have lost interest in Trump because he has proven himself as ridiculous.  He doesn't care about his voters, he only cares about the wealthy.
Seth should be on "The Daily Show" and Trevor on "Late Night"...
Who knew running a country would be hard
orange clown ,is so easy  on word,and slow  in the brain...
Trump's presidency has helped understand myself a little bit better. I might be a psychopath; I will have no hesitation, fear or remorse, just pure joy and relief from killing this guy.
fun fact if there was no civil war, white people wouldn't be a minority in the future! thanks lincoln
The US has turned into a fucking joke with that moron president they have.  He doesn't even know the history of the country he represents for the world
gay in Jamaican
I think honestly by his latest actions and things he said that he will reisgn (or what u call it). I sort of had hope that he would be okay before but now he seem to not even believe in himself.
Well, maybe this incompetent POS will step down and let someone more confident in his abilities take over.
*Libtard(s)* - No longer an insult, more like terminology for the dim-witted individual.
Trump will be remembered for devaluing the dollar 💰 💵💣
Historians actually debate reasons why the civil war started. Stop seeing the war through a liberal bubble
I wouldn't be laughing if I were you, hell obviously kick you outta America lol
And guy's? still laughing?.. still funny? Okay see you in the next 100 day's and a check with you again okay?..
How does Trump know if Jackson was angry? Did Trump ask Jackson if he was angry?  Trump see dead people now?
who is actually running the country at this moment? Trump is absolutely incapable to do it
Oh, the title said POTUS, for a second there I thought it said Putin!
This guy makes GWBush look sooo presidential
How many people regret voting for Trump?
in the middle of talking, he stopped and handed out a map of the electoral college. Good pick America
This guys goes to bed dreaming about trump
your audio is always too damn low
Internet Rule #101: For every Trump action, there is an equal and opposite Trump clip.  #NoMorePoliticalParties
You can be sure that whenever Trump says "Nobody knew" he should actually be saying "I didn't know even though everybody tried to tell me about it because I'm too much of a narcissist to listen to what anybody says".
Ok, curious as to what a trump supporter would say about trump now.
When a football team wins the pregame coin flip, they're well aware that there's a whole lot of work yet to do.  Trump won the election and thought the game was over
yeah. still pissed at Hillary for crapping in HIS diaper.
Hey could anyone help me out and donate some popcorn? I ran out and would go to the store ,but i'm afraid i will miss something.Aww man Trump's antics got me in stiches.
He is so funny!
Trump actually believes that by the magical powers of 'alternative facts' he could actually be right about being wiretapped by Obama wtf
This is just ..........,.,,,,,...
Without any exaggeration, Drumpf has made Bush appear very knowledgeable, compassionate and wise in comparison.
If you stand for nothing Burr, what'll you fall for?
TRUMP ON ANDREW JACKSON: ALTERNATIVE FACTS.
Sponsored by ye'boi, ten minute ad revenu
these cable networks paid by corporations are making tons of Trump.
Oh my god! This man has to be the idiotic president this country has ever had!
What an incompetent flob. Honestly, America. Get your act together
The Civil War could not be worked out because there was no Pepsi around.
Wow I guess giving  one person that much power is a really bad idea
what a great fucking letter
#dramaticexit LMAO
Alex Trebek is Canadian! That's why he's not on the money!
Trump is gonna quit presidency. Mark my words
President Dumbfuck....Good job America!
Remind me again: Why the HELL was this fucking idiot elected?
Trump is pretty hot tho 😇
as a german, it took me a while to realize what "POTUS" means. i was like "potus? what is a potus?"
we need to eliminate the electoral college ....
1:52 - his math homework is clearly photoshopped in - all the answers are correct
I wonder what all those people who watched Apprentice for business tips think of themselves now.
I know he is stupid but we have to live with it.
'I don't stand by anything' is probably the only honest thing he's said.
Being President and making America great again IS easy, so long as you're not a Republican.

rive jgfirovoie
Hi, I started making Dinosaur videos after watching yours. It would be awesome if you could take a quick look!
I depends on which type of tea you get
how can you not like tea!?????
I love the pancake mold. Maybe spraying the mold with cooking spray will help keep them from sticking. you could also use it to bake the cloud bread to make them more uniform in diameter.
that haircut like mighty fine on u 😍
MJ!!! And a reptile
Why did you call your channel +My Virgin Kitchen
You even took over the 'boom' from thecrazyrussianhacker 😂
30, Female, American from Long Island New York, future wife application 😍, think you are cute and love the accent 😘
I would like teaire please I love tea   I vote yes for a gadit a week

Keep making gadget videos!! I love them!!! Please don't stop!! 💔
I am an American and love tea
more gadget vids
love this show 😀
I love these videos SO much please please keep doing them
silly man...you're supposed to add milk and sugar....
Go to your local offlicence and ask for a grinder will do better than the garlic thing
I love the crazy Russian Hacker and yes he is in the USA. Lol. Would love a collab!!!
more gadgets please. we love your videos.
Now I'm waiting for a collab with SORTED food. pls I need it
Everyone i know has a pan that has those holes for making alot of pancakes....
Barry: Slice and precise!  Me:    ...
I can't wait until the next mini food
u had me laughing so hard...I say toss out pancake gadget....
I'm sure someone has mentioned this before, but don't "dunk" your teabag. This releases more tannins and makes the tea more bitter.
Tea is life loul font worry lol my sister is repulsed by tea as well i like the gadget videos there very helpful alway saying ehat would be good to buy and what not good to buy  stay kool ✌✌✌
haha loving all the new angles never, never fails to make me laugh
I can tell you that we bought one of the sprout things at Christmas and they are excellent. The sprouts cook to perfection.
hi Barry I love your YouTube channel  especially kitchen gadgets do lots more till 1000 episodes and more....we love you lot....
I love ur show I would love tea airy
Please, please, pleeeeaaaseeee...more kitchen gadget videos!!They are amazing!
noooo i come just for the gadget videos. love them
I like the name handy kitchen thingy
Hey I love you I watched all your videos in all your channels and I subscribed to them and I liked the garlic pro
You have been away for a long time
I'm just here for the Gadget Videos! Give me more!!!! 😃
Why do you never put milk in your tea!!!!
Nothing wrong with sponsors at all. I watch all the adverts on my subscribed channels including yours. Everyone should. 😀 p.s love threadbanger too.
I know I'm late, but one of his favorite channels is ThreadBanger!!
Yes , more gadget videos would be amazing !
i would not mind 1 video a week
Do tea and milk it's delicious
guess your coming to Asheville NC????? Threadbangers live here and the crazy russian hacker lives like 20 minutes away!!!!! maybe do a meetup when your'e here !!!!!!
Idk why this was recommended to me but I'm ready, nice to meet you Barry!
(Life hack) the cream one instead of using the shield you could use a plate with holes
Is he drinking the tea without sugar? 
Silly Barry.....thats a weed grinder!!
You need to collaborate with threadbanger!!!!
Tea-erry looks like Kenny from South Park. LoL
I want that Deep tea diver infuser
In the U.K. It did used to be challenge 21 but is now challenge 25
That 25 thing is if you 25 or under you get ask for id but ok if u look under
looks like a grinder
Honestly, I love the smell of garlic.
Tea-ary looks like Kenny from South Park.
i love the gadget videos! and it would be awesome for you and crazy russian hacker to do on together!!!!!!
btw I LOVE your videos!
Keep it as a bunch at once. You always seem to enjoy your self when there are multiple at once!!
That's a no for me too. Better a few in one video then just a short video. Greetings from Germany 😘
Crazy Russian hacker is... a hack. He tried to kill his audience with a Co2 'air conditioner'. Good one.
Like a mosh pit in a teacup is how I describe my stomach after a good night of drinking.
I use vanilla sugar at my pancakes.with real vanilla no extract.
Yes'!!!! Love love love kitchen gadget videos
I about spit out my coffee laughing whilst watching this episode. Hope your hand feels better soon.
some of your gadget videos have been around 20 minutes with a lot of gadgets. I think you should do perhaps more gadget videos but make them shorter, with a few items per video.
lol #barrygotapassport
You're always good for a laugh Barry! 😂
I know what you mean by it not tasting like it smells.
I'm so bad because I'm sick.
I'm so bad because I'm sick
You could name your teadiver Kenny, because he looks like Kenny from South Park. I think you could gadget videos like this one are much more fun than a gadget of the week.
I think you should hust stick to what you were doing.  I like that better
more gadget videos yes please! one gadget a video no thank you. I like lots of gadgets in one.
think the pankake thing would work better withotu a gas oven =)'
When will he shut it
what's the recipe for the pancakes @myvirginkitchen ? they look delicious :)
I wanted more kitchen gadgets video 2 times a week I think / I love therbanger and the crazy Russin hacker 
Defiantly keep on doing the kitchen gadget videos 😊
Yes! More gadgets videos!!
The "zero calorie food" just made me stop watching
That kick drum is serious business
PLASTIC ON THE CEILING
Gosh darned this is a fun song!
it's the momentz we achieve
This is like a song like do ya thing that can be in the background of a chill 3D animated music video
this blew me out of the universe
I like the parts where it goes *MOMENTZ*  good song
God damn I needed this!
God this is one of the best tracks on the album. Pumps me tf up and gives me goosebumps ITS SO GOOD. who wants to fucking party??
daAAAAMnnnn this is my jam bro
its momentz like these that make a good day
Sounds like a video game Also every song de la soul is in I really like
im listening the whole night while i sleep so all the lyrics get in my head :')
this is such a good recent comeback song for del la soul it definitely doesn't dissapoint.
I'm sooooo glad that they are back
De la soul sounds like smashmouth to be perfectly honest..
YAY 2M SUBS
call 911, fingers to bloody from hitting replay...😭🙃
Where are the explicit lyrics?
😅😈 I'm so happy with this entire album they did a great job with it. But this is my favorite song
i missed de la soul soo much!! its so great to hear him in gorillaz content again
i love this , charger & andromeda are the best my top 3
when you talkin bout the kool klown klan
This is the kind of music when shows try to predict future music trends
fresh of breath air
I love every bit of this song. Except that damn kick! What the fuck is that, fix that shit!
im talking about the kool klown klan...the kool klown klan
good stuff but all the guests make up most of the album lol
Does this song make anybody else manically happy and sad at the same time or is it just me?
" Plastic on the ceiling! " ..Oh, I love that part. <3
i hope Del the ghost rapper comes back
which one will have a music vid
1:39 - 2:03 Who was that?
One of my favorites from Humanz
One part sonunds like andy grammar
Brah this straight up came out of my screen and slapped me when it dropped
Gorillaz and De La Soul dropping another amazing song. I'm so happy to hear them making music together again.
i think the album is called humanz because its mainly HUMANZ singing the songs
I love this song. Now if only Del will make a return
I'm talkin about the kool klown clan
one of my favorites songzs on the album I even bought the album 100\10 album but the only song I didn't really like was xxx murder party that's the only though but still amazing album
That solid beat makes this easily my fav song, and when they say "momentz" to the beat it makes me think of a techmo tride of indians,and when the girls are siging with that beat,ITS SO GREAT TO LISTEN TO
this might be my fav...the way they say momentz
Kool Klown Klan
my mom found me dancing the hell out of my self and i said "HAVE YOU HEARD THIS SONG???"
This is my favorite song. too much lit shit happening
Fuck yeah De La Soul!!! :D
Dude hearing De La Soul again warmed my heart they have been in the last two albums as well
dirty dirty
*SHIVERS DOWN MY BACKBONE* I don't know why, but that was such a good and powerful transition.
*Shiver down my backbone*
KOOL KLOWN KLAN!! 😂
Don't you guys love Breath Air? Also the fresh prince of Breath Air.
heyyy thats pretty good
I need to step out for a fresh of breath air after that.
less than 1000 view...wow...should be like........1 million
Dont mind me, just binge listing to this entire album.
Feel good ink part 2 please and a remake of Clint Eastwood
A great song for those hard Momentz
this song is perfect for these monentz
Is funny. De La Soul was the one who rap in Feel Good Inc.
i think im having a moment.  EDIT: *momentz
Religion and drugs, hmm dangerous cocktail!
Lol he is Jesus but gets his age wrong
People need to think that maybe some people being labeled mentally insane are actually seeing things other people can't see. They are the chosen ones.
Fuck this piece of shitI HOPE HE IS BURNING IN FUCKING HELL
For the first clip I gotta say, Cocaine is one  hell of a drug
GOD IS GREAT.....
How the hell are these Jews still alive?
Religion requires detachment from reality. Most religions, especially christianity, and islam, are steeped in violence. Is it surprising that these combine in unstable people?
lmao no hint of depression,cause being locked in a cage 23 hrs a day makes you happy
drugs r really good
Set is gods son, you think the devil is your enemy while the reptilians laugh at you
Your mind can do anything stupid or absolutely mental while on drugs. This is people on flaka,bath salt maybe or people drunk and taking wrong pills.
I don't understand what point the video is trying to make...
Sick and tired of these misleading headings. Shocking Footage' of Something You Have to See! (2017-2018)
Worlds destiny sits on OUR shoulders. When will we start to take it back?
Religion just exasperates mental illness.
Well, no wonder I ain't a zealot. You live longer. Likely saner to
I'm going to hell.
In the last days will be wars and rumors of wars. Many will say they are Jesus or the father, God.
Oh!! They caught a real werewolf? That's amazing!
Hernandez died, this is good news!
Don't believe everything you see and hear on Media !!!! It's all a big BS
Seems like a lot of atheist are starting to panic and wondering what's going on  may the fear of God be in them
hm... maybe because American's are brain washed bible thumpers?
so the Illuminati used him for a sacrifice wouldn't be the first one and definitely not the last
this is because of living against God's order. don't do drugs.
think about it what is this distract you from .
what a waste of my time
Remind me. What are the wages of sin again?
WAS THAT A ZOMBIE HOLY FUCK IM GETTING HEATED (EXCITED)!
seems like this all wouldnt have happened without religion :)
How could I pass this video up, I mean look at the title......
It's a bit ironic that Aaron Hernandez was a receiver in football and it sounds like he did a bit of "receiving" in prison as well haha.
So much BS!
Israel is such an evil abomination, such a stain on the Spirit of Humanity that when decent souls expose themselves to this cesspool the effects are dramatic. Let's end the evil that is IsraHell.
life goes on,  let me know when I had enough.
The media is obviously trying to make Christians look like crazy zombies so they can have a reason to persecute them and kill us all who dont accept the mark of the beast period
Religion is what will destroy the world.
illness is called religion
Oh is this a way the elite are using to vilify Christians...
stupid religious fkrs going crazy just to make what the bible says come true the morons  lolo
mentally people these days...
You seem to have omitted everything that anyone "has to see."  Just some more youtube stuff.
Typical youtube clickbait from this channel, nothing shocking whatsoever, just a clip of various people with mental illness's
Notice how this only happens with Jesus Christ. No spirits do this with other religious figures. Something's there...
Lol the Jesus man shot at him with a BB gun....
Trump supporters are a bunch of SHEEP!
So whats the point of this video?
I guess athism is a good thing then...
it's all about the like button.
Why is it that people are saying that God isn't their God. If you respect him, he will save you. If you don't believe in him, it won't turn out well. God is our creator and savior
reasons not to do pcp
Why do you always see mental illness, crime and religion all together?
Red hands and feet are Luciferian markers of death, possession.
all the Americans
All of Jason A videos are clickbait, he is a religious nut. He is making a profit of your ignorance and trying to keep you in FEAR.
Insanity breeds insanity. All the crazies quote the bible and claim to be devils and angels and gods
He was trying to tell everyone about the illuminati, and about faith.
what retard created this
Nothing here to see.  Same crap, different day.
WTF?.....who's kiddin who!?...y'all think Hernandez was smart enought to write that bible shit on 4 head and every letter backwards.....fack
funny how all thes mass murders are from religious nuts lul, anywone else see a pattern here?
Seems then that Islam is the only religion that don't need delusions to comit crimes.
god is coming too soon, so ask God for his forgiveness........  NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
I was baptized Christian and for what, the person you praise is your God  was nothing other than a lunatic and that is real truth.
those Americans​do not represent me
I'm just glad to believe in something we can least prove and understand in the physical realm.......my good friend science. You guys can keep your fairy tales, Disney does it better anyway.
Too bad for the Non believers... Jesus is our savior. Don't let one soul sway you away from the truth.
This is obvious that these people are high on Flakka or Some other synthetic drug. I see this type of behavior all the time.
please don't curse the Illuminati with this guy
that's the first thing I thought something fishy went on in there and I don't feel bad for the guy

omg that was crazy !!
DANG! that is a big tornado. i am glad that everybody is A OK
Erin!!!  She was a reporter for KSLA in Shreveport, LA!!  Glad she and others there were ok!!  Praying for the families of the ones who did not survive!!
Incredible footage. That is one ugly beast.
Incredible video. There seems to be a balance issue in regards to the audio, however, thanks for uploading!
If you're not intelligent enough to stop rebuilding and just get the hell out of tornado ally, whatever happens to you and your house will be the result of your own ignorance.
god punishing texas for trump
I herd there were 4 tornados
that's a big tornado :[
I hope that the people who were affected by this get a speedy recovery. That just looks really scary.
thats one smart girl she saved her life and cute too
A stormchaser chasing this monster said high end F2 and F3 damage was present, survey team may find small area of EF4 damage but EF5 rating is very unlikely.
if there was no such thing as latent heat, this could not happen. many people with a PHD do NOT know that. stick  that in your pipe and smoke it man
omg, I love two from there 😣 glad some ppl made it out
Having lived through a tornado, I recognize the look on all those survivors: That sort of dreamy shock where you can't decide if this is actually happening.
This has to be one of the scariest records I have ever seen. Especially how big that tornado is and how close he is to it,=.
A bank vault is best shelter. Car dealership should be brick not metal, that's why a tornado destroys mobile home parks.
If that fat girl being interviewed towards the end wasn't fat, she would be really hot
That's like two towns over from we're I live
The girl getting interviewed at 5:10 is gorgeous.
THEY PIRATED THEIR OWN VIDEO!! LOL
think u need to get this fixed cause u own it anyway  it saying u pirated the video
shouting I love you! i love you! i love you! as you were parked under a covered roof parking garage with your "boyfriend" how hilarious  you knew you weren't gonna die lol
What a horrifying experience for parent and their precious children! 💔😓💔😓💔😓💔😓💔😓💔😓
nothing stops WalMart
Was the woman at 3:35 planning to start the car and drive away?
this is how god takes care of illegal immigrants... lmao
My prayers to every single person that had to go through this and for the ones that didn't make it .🙏🏼
Hey 🌪, Take a break and have some ice cream! {\_/} (• - •) 🍦<\
Climate change doesn't exist.. Climate change doesn't exist... Trumpo is my Jesus.. Climate change doesn't exist... hands over ears and eyes... because Dump said so.. Climate change doesn't exist
Great job recording. Thank you. Sorry for the people.
why aren't the tornado sirens going off
If that's an ef5 then that's the finger of God
I was at a sleep over 30 mins from the storm. I didn't know about any of this! My sister and her boyfriend were in the storm and they are ok.When I grow up I'm going to be a storm chaser
Unfortunately, I have been the path, or near in a tornado, and I also have been close up to Niagara falls, and in my view, that is what the huge wedge tornados sound like when you are in or near a one!
GOD BLESS THESE PEOPLE AND HOPING THEY CAN RECOVER .
Appears to be EF3, if not EF4 damage.
So scary!!!
Which one is this one......they said there were two of them IIRC.
That's the first video I've seen where they focus on the damage to vehicles and show the aftermath, and lucky to talk to this young woman right after, she was very lucky. Not one word of these storms on mainstream news.
Man that Dodge/Jeep dealer looked like it was made of Balsa Wood, hope no employees were in there when this happened.
looks like an F3  maybe 4
Ya have to love the WalMart truck making his delivery come hell or high water. LMAO Right in tornado's path Walmart comes through.  Toast to you, sir!
I sure hope no lives were lost in that tornado, it looks like an EF4 at least..
Prey for canton
I saw a lot of this same footage on Weathernation, I hope that have it legally.
Where does the cocky dumbsh*t at 00:24 think he's going?
So sorry for everyone's loss!! She has my exact car. Oxford White 2016 Civic EX-T. 💔 I certainly wish everyone the best and a speedy recovery
I went after this tornado and helped everyone who lived on 69 in Emory. First tornado ever chased.
amazing footage as always. tried watching live feed but signal so bad. glad you are okay!
ROFL ....love the watermark..bwahahaha
that.  looks like an f 5
Strength to everyone affected. I made a miscalculation last night and I regret it. Stay safe everybody the coming days as I understood there is a chance of more to come!!!!
Do people who've been injured through no fault of their own (nature-related, say; tornado etc), have to pay for/toward the medical expenses in aiding their return to health?
My heart goes out to these people :(
Might be more like the hand of God, Ms . Stevenson. That was a whole lot of wreckage.
I lived in Missouri for many years, Fort Worth for a few more...lived thru several tornadoes...but Ive never seen up close these massive wedges that have been developing over the last 20 years.  You can't outrun them.
what a tornado its a F5 tornado
I am curious how you guys decide where to be in storm systems like this. These storms are popping up everywhere and some of them are parts of huge cells (or at least I think texas is in the same system as tulsa)
my wifes friend in canton, desirae st Clair, lost her house. Des, her daughter and husband are ok. her hardcore grandma  went after them, even though there were tornados all along Hw. 19. Merla is a badass.
too much emphasis on aftermath and really didn't need too see a person on stretcher.
Glad everyone's ok. Hope someone gave Erin a hug, heavy stuff man. Peace, John in Idaho
Does "23 and me" work if you have down syndrome, i only learned today that its because they have an extra chromosome because math class is really boring and i didn't do my health homework so i had to read about that.
thanks for the advice .
only $60k in debt? for a DVM degree at TAMU... damn, you must have had a lot of scholarships... Or Meredith was paying while you were going.  Holy shit, how much food did you give those cats?!?
What was the name of that little blue tool you used in the beginning?
Awesome speech at the end, Matt. I needed a reminder
You know what little thing made me happy today? I wore my "most American t shirt" for the first time!
Mair is definitely a khaleesi so she must have a dragon.    WINTER IS COMING!
YouTube don't deserve to delete your videos because there made for educational purposes
Who know email of Matt?
I love it when you share your wisdom!  You're so young to be so wise.  Great job to your parents especially as it applies to your debt.  Thank you Matt!
Does anyone know the song at 11:53 ?
Is there any way you can buy a personality for that chick? She is as dull as can be!
Wow... Seems like Mere is the dream girl to all of your subs... But your reality. How does that make you feel?
4-6 weeks!! it only takes 1 in England.
Happy Mothers day mom! now spit in this jar!
That talk at the end got me. Got me going!
Matt  One of my Dogs has a severe ear infection it goes away once in a while but it comes back with a vengeance, Do you have any tips on how to clean or any medicine.  Thanks
why do matt and mere need seperate tests? aren't they cousins?
dont forget that baha bug tho
all the video was nice but really the last bit you said made my day thanks allot
1:49 I say the same thing about the hookers I pick up
Mary the better one at construction . and she is gorgeous
Not gonna lie , but i am surprised to see people disliking vids like these !
Whats the name of that song?
Thanks for that bit at the end! Absolutely love that and agree!!
Definitely over, why is Meredith not making the chicken house run instead of buying, she would be able to make it a little crazy.
what does she hate most about mat? i bet its his singing
These DNA tests may be governments secret way to get your DNA sample.
Matt, you're an amazing person
This is one of the best channels on YouTube and of course demoranch is also one of the best lol. But you never cease to inspire and teach during your videos.
Hey Ranch, you should do a video about who you guys are as a family and what you guys believe and what your goals are.
Hah. He knows his audience. Unhappy and lazy. Why else would we be on YouTube?
Matt do you have a p.o box for fan mail!
Goddam the fucked that song up with Justin Bober
Matt you and your family are such an inspiration. I can't wait to get married and start my own family because of you. Best YouTuber ever
wise Words at the end Matt, Love you
She's cheating on you sorry to break it.
Thanks Matt your inspiration makes me wanna go forward in life
my wife can't even use a power drill lol
he has and awesome wife awesome kids and life.. Godbless you matt!
Over the Top
wth was that noise at 8:20 it freaked me out lul
Im thinking of making 0:41 my ring tone for certain individuals lol
and a wife that can use power tools
I LOVE DESPACITO
i needed that motivation. :)
such a great yt channel!!
matt your wife it the best
TODAY a youtube has really motivated me
I just noticed.  Mere looks kind of like Sandra Bullock, only prettier.
Came for construction ranch, stayed for inspiration ranch
Meres legs tho😱😱
put the hens in a horse stall for bit works great!
New favorite offtheranch video! Thanks matt you're inspirational because of your words AND your actions and thank you for sharing your life with us a little bit each day.
The ending, dude.
i don't know why, but the first 40 seconds made me me so happy.
Matt you need to be a motivational speaker.
Toilet paper does go over the top!
60k in 2 years. wow man. that's fast. even for swiss standards...
SHUUUUUUUUUUUT ITTTT! LMFAO!
So she wasn't pissed about the indoor shooting range
hey matt you should make a shirt with pictures of all your AR-15s on it then on the left sleeve pit .50 then on the right sleeve put fridays
motivational AF. thanx
The right way to put the toilet paper in the holder is called "Being immersive"  Also, Justin Johnson? The youtuber blues guy who makes amazing music? :p  Haha
Awesome Family picture, you are blessed!!! Beautiful Family.
over the top is the correct way. look up the patent.
Yooo, what song is that? That Spanish one. That was a banger
you guys are awesome
put Dozer's spit
"just be happy" is arguably the worst advice to give to make someone happy.
Matt the moral philosopher.  He's not wrong but a greater moral philosopher said happiness is being persecuted for doing good.
just got the most american shirt it's the best!
I love when you end a video with something deep like that :D
Very pleasant video. We'll see ya next time.
what is the song at 0:45, pls!
U r the best ❤️ thank u for the last part of the video ☺️
What a great man, husband and father‼️ Great woman, wife and mother‼️ WONDERFUL family❣️God bless you in all your endeavors❣️
not that fucking despacito song please, i wanna kill my self😠
Great words of advice.
by far my favorite youtuber from vetranch to offtheranch and demoranch <3 love u man
lol i feel like mare was gonna say something really funny, but since the whole youtube universe would hear it... and her kids. She refrained from saying it.
you actually made me do homework.  thanks :)
Did anyone else hear a noise at 8:19 or was that just me?
so you have a welsh name that every one pronounces and also spells wrong??
Im just saying, putting my DNA in the big brother mechine isnt really for me...
Woah! Matt sings in Spanish better than me😂😂

silly name, huh?
Awesome Video
Very good video. You are fantastic
Don't worry they'll make something up for us all to watch later...  PROPAGANDIST
secret service should have shot him
Immediately back-pedals! Dickhead. Does he seriously think there wouldn't be armed guards behind that door?
These snowflake Demo baby so called media reporters are nothing but Soros, Rothschild hacks! Good on Sean for treating them as they deserve to be treated!
Lol Sean Spicer is such a coward.  Just like his boss.  Refusing to answer questions doesn't make you tough.
Sean was in the break room when this happened... we were reheating some General Tso chicken in the microwave. ...he just laughed and said "they'll figure it out". LOL! He's a lot of fun.
I'm pretty sure that must be illegal.  That guy should not be allowed back
I guess some reporters are just born idiots.
such children, why ask all these questions when you already know the answer
That's  not  Sean Spicer
Listen to these self righteous bafoons.  They're like  children when they don't get their way
All this means is that tomorrow's press conference is going to be a good watch
NBC...Nothing But Crap.
Sounds like a room full of babies....
tomorrow sean going blame Obama for this some how
"Wah wah I want my sean sean Wah wah Russia putin im a bitch"
cackling presstitutes,
Liberal media. Propaganda arm of the Democrat party.
Nothing But Crap news strikes again
I wish secret service would have slammed his ass
SHAAAAAWN ...... Geez they sound like Parrots echoing off eachother
LOL...I only clicked this video because I thought it had something to do with Trump playing golf.
Sean did Leave The Press Hanging Ohwell
They sound like my 4 year old
Wow Spicer is a tool.
Sean knows how to punk these assholes. 👍👍😂😂
Daddy daycare needs to set the rules straight so all the kiddies know up front...
Spiced.....
Someone said he had a brown spot on his pants, and he had diarrhea, so was trying to get to the closest bathroom.
😭 Sean, you know we are weak, cry baby liberals!! Don't walk away like that! You hurt my feelings!
How many times does this liberal media need to hear the same answer to the same question before they believe it? They need to be drug tested!
im confused.  how is trump,  different,  from hillary?
Wow!!  That guy is groomed deep if not a consenting peddler of tyranny and  enforcement of  bureaucratic  policies.   SMH 
Sean, Sean, Sean please give us attention please are lives are pointless without you. Sean please we won't do it again please Sean. Sean, Ssssssseeeeeeeeaaaaaaannnnn!
He was overwhelmed by butthurt.  SS should have tackled him.
It sounded like a room full of whiny kids.
Fox News has brought something to light about the Press Corps.... they're all Democrats no Republicans....
I would have that reporter barred from coming back to the White House or The Press Room who do these people think they are kick these sumbitches out.
can someone elaborate on what happened please?
These aren't "reporters"... stop referring to them as such!  Reporters went extinct soon after radio. These are actors, liberal arts trained actors  who practice looking pretty and spew their abusive leftist agenda
Yet if this would have been when Obama was around you mfs would be cheering. Smh
Fucking disgusting leftists. Absolutely pathetic scavengers. 
"Sean, thank you for the questions, please?  Sean.  Sean?!  SEAN?!?!"  I love it.  MAGA 2020
He violated his agreement with the white house! Pull his pass!
What a coward
And of course you hear piggy April above everyone else. She's the worst one of this disgusting bunch
These reporters are like 1st graders.
Reporters these days are not journalists they are just "sellout yes men."
secret service should have shot him.
fuckin secret service is completely useless. they had a chance to shoot a traitor and they didnt
Loving this, republicans got nothing in the budget and spicy can't face the defeat.
They actually whined and moaned.  wtf
He should have been slammed on his neck by a serect service member.
that didn't look good lol
Phouck all of you lying treasonous media thugs!  Come please interview me!!!!
Hope his entitled royal asshole got arrested
Screw the media! Tired of the lies! When is Hillary going to jail?
Oh please with the biggest liar in the world and someone who only gets his way by acting like a child trump supporters should have nothing to say !!!!!
lefty media are fascists
That arrogant fool should've been escorted out immediately!
The Whitehouse better respond appropriately by revoking the fake news "reporters" access.  Trump has a LOT more tolerance than I would have had with the these babies.
Try that in North Korea & see where that gets you.
five years in prison would do nicely
"oh Sean, oh Sean"  LOL! listen to those whinny brats.
They are announcers not reporters. They love to hear their own voice. Huge difference.
this is a sitcom. They yell "Sean!!!" like it is a joke lol
sean, sean, sean, ssseeeaaannn... those reporters sound like a bunch of whinny little children.
C'mon Sean!!!
"Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean....what about that booty call, Sean? Come onnnnnnn......"
Fucking hell they're like a bunch of children.
I wonder if any of the members of the press core will ever grow up. They seem to have the mentality of immature whiny little children.
These so called reporters are human trash. Let Mike Cernovich back in and get rid of these Liberal cucks!!
dumbass about to get his ass shot
holy cow. i can feel there spoiled mentality from here it's that bad.
that's dangerous report him to authorities they do not have access to the White House like that
Good , that's exactly what you fake news dicklickers deserve !!!!!!!!!!
NICE n SPICY ................I LOVE IT  LIB/TURDS CAN`T HACK IT THO
He broke protocol, revoke his press pass. Liberals clearly have no understanding of rules and laws.
"What about the Putin call" LMFAOO
Damn, that fake news reporter was seriously triggered!
hahaha, wow.  can that guy do that and not get a ticket with a fine for trespassing ?
No reporter has ever chased down josh ernest. they all knew he was and would lie to all present reporters.
ENG subtitles please please thank you🇮🇪👏
next upcoming episodes pls
Too many death, too fast!!!!
write coleman and tell them that rack does not work
still eatable lol
Bob what are your tatoos?
wow nice I want one
I love fish sticks too and cornbread
Can u put a lid on that baking pan and make the pan the oven? Maybe add a pizza stone under the pan to distribute the heat more evenly? Might cook faster too.
Bob, have you tried a frozen pizza in that oven? Tombstone or Red Baron pizza?I think you like pizza also.
Very informative. Don't get hurt using... Outside much better choice.
it looks like a little bank safe!
camp stove/oven  run on propane available on Amazon for $175...I got one and they are AWESOME!!
Bob, you can create the oven effect by using a pan with a lid on the burner.  just regulate the heat so it doesn't get too hot, and your fish fillets will be yummy in half the time!  haha
are you trying to burn your van down , lol , I watch this video twice, lol at least you enjoy your fish
It's not just the CO (though your blood would rather absorb CO than oxygen), combustion uses oxygen and you can suffocate...
Really to big for the van, but cook out side, heating van with something else but right now can't think of one. Good luck
I always add a bit of olive oil to the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking. I just enjoyed some flounder filets that way. thanks for the review!
Having it standing on that Rubbermaid type container makes me nervous for all kinds of safety reasons.
i said if the grate fall ,its a fail
give it up, Bob!
your coat hanger idea is great. I have one also. I use a coat hanger hooked to the ceiling to make sure it can't fall.
What an excellent, helpful, and smart review.  Thanks for doing it.
Is there any way you can strap down the oven to the stove?
Use a frying pan that takes to long.
Is this your new Van?
Welcome to Oregon from Troutdale (east portland), enjoy our (few) nice days right now.
Although I'm not sure if it will work reusable cotter pins may help to retain the shelves position.
I live in stationary 5th wheel. Afraid of stove and gas lines. All I use is Coleman stove and oven. Makes good meatloaf. Good even cooking for a little holdup oven isn't it? LOVE all your videos. Learned much.
scary video.  too many things to go wrong.
God loves a trier Bob. Have you reviewed the solar oven, that would be an interest to me as I'm moving from the UK to Australia
That's pretty neat, thanks Bob
The brick idea seem's to becoming over  engineered, confudeled & it maybe better applied by just throwing them at something, like cavemen did.
Yummy! I like mine with tartar sauce!!
Bob, check out Adventure Van Man, he has the same burner as you and has come up with a pretty good oven. Cheers!
would be great to interview people with the various fridges and how they've held up over the years.
Where's the Tatar sauce?
Great review, thank you.
I bought one about 3 months ago, its still in the box .... Lol
Omg I used to love fish sticks!! I might have to grab some tonight! Love this oven too👍👍👍
did the stove damage the plastic on top of tote? i burnt a hole thru a plastic table  cookin similar to that.  ha
Great when you review a product. Was a great tip about the fish fillets not having to be frozen. Can you recommend other foods that would be considered " frozen " foods that you've discovered work as the fish. Thanx .
It seems awfully clumsy to assemble.  I think if I ever get up and running, I may use candle power for heat. I noticed how well they heat up my living room when I light one...enough to keep the heat from kicking on.
why do you have a van, and not a box van (with straight walls, standing hight) anymore ? or at least a van with high roof for standing up.
Put a pizza stone over the grate to keep the bottom of your food from burning.  I also use a pizza peel (small) to remove the cookware.  I don't get burned that way!
Do the stove corners rotate outward to make a wider "stance" for the oven to sit on?
I have one. Great concept, but VERY inefficient. It needs some sort of insulation.  It's sad that Coleman's never bothered to develop this into a mature product. Where are the Germans when you need them?
looking good with the beard trim!!!!!
Oh Yeah!  Fish Sticks with mac n' cheese on Fridays at school!
I LOVE FISHSTICKS TOO! I am also from Alaska just like you! Hmmm... I wonder?
Nice video Bob safe travels.
You just won a subscriber :)
I very much like the fact that you do as it happens viewing. Any mistakes or mishaps happens as it would. Great video. Thankyou.
Good video.
Looks like a great little oven for camping trips Thanks for the review Bob
I'm beginning to understand why you are so soft with the girls , your hopping one will cook for you !
Fish sticks LOL. You're the best Bob. Do you like putting fish sticks in your mouth? Kanye?
The Good the Bad and the Ugly. That is what the world needs. Excellent review!
what I want to know is how could that have fallen and you not know? did you leave the stove cooking while you walked away?
It would be so much quicker to just fry them.
couldnt that fish be cooked in a frying pan
3:30-6:30 for those wanting tip save time!
do those rack tips stick out enough to run a wire through the bends like a cotter key?
Stove on a plastic bin, then an oven on top ......... !!! this video would make a good comedy sketch
Saw this coming.  You're going to be even more devoted to maintaining internet connectivity.  To keep that business in business!
Bob, Thanks for the honest review. It's helpful
coat hangers again to some the stability issue. just a suggestion
Place a barbeque grill or a grill from a small oven over the stove to balance the oven.
Back in my day we used to make a distinction between what is a "stove" and what is an "oven".
Never eat brownies from a guy living in a van. 😊
whats is bobs email?
I've never heard of a camp oven until this video.  So, since the oven will not work in the van, what are you going to do about heat?
Bob, could you use cotter pins on the outside of the oven to hold the rack more securely?
Epic fail for Coleman, but "it was delicious "!! Glad you enjoyed!
You made me hungry for fish-sticks.
Now i want Fish sticks.    Think i'd prefer a built in oven.
also, would cotter pins clipped to the rack tabs (outside oven) hold it secure? might be easier than coat hanger wire.
surface. lol
what if you put a cooling rack between the stove & oven. it would give a more stable service for it to sit on.
the way you eat bananas walnuts nd express in such a way seems u never ate in ur country.😀😀😁😀
wow so beautiful
nice place I want to go there someday its cool and peace!
You can only find incredible **** like that in other countries outside the Americas...........
beautiful place
Beautiful places!
I do want to add...I found the Bhutanese men and women very good looking. I kept falling in love everyday!
i love your vids keep up the good work Mark!!
Thank you for sharing your trip to Bhutan with us, I have enjoyed every video. The land and people in Bhutan seemed so pure and beautiful.
Awesome!  I would love to go there.  Beautiful!
OMG...that view..all I can say is Incredible.
Really thai food on the last bhutan day?? no i was hoping to see some more good ezeh and some emma dhatsi
He always shows the reaction to every food he bites. sour bananas?
i hope u told them about God!!
Wonderful to see Bhutan
Thanks for this amazing video! It makes me want to do the whole trip just exactly the same way. (except I'll need twice as long to get up the mountain, lol!)
wow thank you Mark for this video ...breathaking views on Tiger Nest...please don't forget to check or googled my island MANADO INDONESIA we have wonderful spicy foods and place to go.....
Mark u should visit Bangladesh and u will find so much good food
Damn! I wanna visit there soon
I went to Bhutan in far cry 4.
Did you feed dogs eventually, Mark?
AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME BHUTAN SERIE  (O_O) Thank you so much Mark and Ying
The real question is how do they build?that cuz they don't have technology like other countries have.
Mark loves fatty nuts
Mark I loved your Bhutan series! I'm really sad that the videos are over but hopefully one day I can go and visit Bhutan to experience all of its beauty :)
do you eat everything you order you seem to order soo much yet stay soo slim lol...
very nice vlog Mark :)
the hike too the Monastery looked amazing!!
i love his videos :) he seems like really nice guy
even though 20 days in a row eating ”ema dazi“, you always  keep smile all the way through....thanks for this detailed Bhudan feast
Nice scenery ... the air there must be clean and fresh !! ... My sis is going Bhutan this week!
bhutanese food looks amazing
ı love so much your videos Mark thank so much :))
Who's watching Mark Wiens eat a banana while eating a banana?
bhutan is stunning
There's a communal spoon on each dishes at the Thai restaurant but you used your personal spoon you ate off with your saliva is kind of disrespectful since you're eating with strangers not your family members.
Fantastic as always.
Reminds me of temple of ra's al ghul
You rock, Mark. Always 😘
I'm sure you've been asked this before, but why no knives? You're always cutting your food with a fork and spoon.
Thanks for this wonderful series in Bhutan. It looks stunning, especially the monastery featuring in this video. Keep up the good work! Anxious to see your Philippines series. Big hello from the Netherlands.
So sad, doggo got no food. I would have given it my snacks.
Visited Bhutan about 3 years ago...absolutely LOVED it. Bhutan is amazing. Also...your energy is infectious & so positive.
Was the dog follow you guys all the way?
yehey you did a Philippines food tour video...regards to u and ying! ☺
MARK your videos should be turned into a BIG documentary on Bhutan, this is just a stunning series you've made!!!!!!!
Another awesome day in Bhutan - you saved the best for last! Thank you and ying
Mark, is your mother in law watching Micah for the time being? we haven't seen him in awhile. love your videos, keep them coming.
Goodness, Bhutanese food has cheese in every dish lol  Also, doesn't seem to be a wide variety.  I'm sure there are reasons for it .. due to altitude, weather and availability.  Once again, great series.  Thank you :)
perfectttt, thank you for all videosss
mark, did you tried EZE and EMADTZI in Bhutan?
The view totally breathtaking! ❤️ So much love from Indonesia.
Great vlog and food.
#MarkWiens  Could you please tell me whats the name of the music at around 3:50? :-)
thats amazing. how did they build those monastery up on the hill? pretty sure the technology is not that advanced back then.
19 x $500 = $9,500. No wonder the people there are happy!
Beautiful Bhutan thanks mark for beautiful videos of Bhutan....keep up the good work
Ur exaggerated face really makes me uncomfortable...
Mark, what time of the year was your visit?
It pisses me off me when you eat food
Are most Bhutanese people quite flatulent because they eat a lot of cheese? I heard that most East Asians are lactose intolerant and can't digest dairy products properly.
Mark - What are the spinning drums outside the monasteries? Any meanings?
I love you mark and your wife.
when Mark learns how to chew without making so much noise world will be a better place
What's up with the  bug-eyed expression all the time?  It looks like he's straining really hard to make his eyes pop out.
that looks amazing. even the dog felt proud. stunning view up in the mountains. thanks so much Mark.
nice video man !!@
he look think after eating all those Chink food
Wow! Thanks for sharing. Love Your videos. IMHO this was the best trip ever!  How could one not want to visit a country where its focus is happiness and kindness is practically a legal requirement?
Bhutan is boring Sam
Fortunate Bhutan...A country to be admired and emulated. :-D
Please every time don't make same reaction.. it really looks fake
I am curious why they translated it directly as Tiger's Nest instead of Tiger's Den. Tibetan and Bhutanese use Stang for both tiger's  den also to bird's nest.
throw the dogs a mini banana, geez.
omg!! love that dog!!
Bhutanese cuisine really does look/taste like the worst cuisine on planet earth
Enjoyed the entire Bhutan series immensely. Thanks Mark!
Too much narration and eating Mark.  Let's get on with the tour.  { Dramatic }
Sorry mark but stop lying bout what's good or not . Your growing subs deserve genuine honest food reviews
Thank you Mark
Thank you for the beautiful food, people and what I enjoyed most was the scenery of the landscape and the Monastery....... so thank you for Bhutan
You are the best

Think noodles I also have shiny hoppa

I only need manaphy Ray and giratina for my legend collection
Pier he's the legendary god pokemon and it's type is normal
you need shiny hoops to summon just a reminder
I have finally bought some robux!!!
it's manaphy not arceus
I have hoopa. Think I think you can get hoopa too
Think dianceite is. Not obtainable like if you agree
Your first legendary was manaphy think 
Ime have mega sabley
when you fought tepig the mewtwo killed you
You can also do the flying glitch with the wailord, the troll wailord
i have been playing for like just 1 month and i got all legends already except regis and zygarde obviously also i have shiny hoopa already
It was mewtow that legendary!😤
dude hoopa spawns random i got my hoopa as deoxys speed form lvl 100 rly fast i was lucky it spawned on the 1st floor but it spawns random anywhere
Do you have Uranus
They forgot staraptor
well, you can control the lugia flight, you just gotta master it :)
that's not shiny arcues he would be a different color
i have hoopa
I'm soooo Lucky that I played the game at 3:00 when everyone's sleeping! There was a guy who spawned Hoopa for me!!!!!

what is that honchkrow?!
Lol Hoopa was my first Legendary XD
#Mewtwo killed think
The MewTwo killed u
rtooub tuoivy ppig
it was actually the mew two that killed him
Think the Pokémon at 10:56 was able to fly because he had hacks allowing him to fly and stuff if the creator is watching this that player would probably be banned and it's good that the Mew killed him
Think don't feel to bad I don't have shiny hoops yet, BUT I HAVE NORMAL HOOPA
Dude I had a arceus dance party once an I was the only shiny
7:50 the most intense battle ever
sableye mega stone spawn on the radioactive water

Fletchinder looks like an angry bird

How dare you insult Aquaman. How dare you
These theories get so hilarious sometimes.
do a new one on rick and morty!
the fact that if i really wanted to, i could purchase this is ridiculous. WHO THE FUCK WANTS TO BUY THE COMMON COLD?????
couldnt you just drown him?
deadpool  cant die he was melted (brain too) but he still heal watch deadpool v deathstroke to get the info or look it up
Please can you do Fantastic Beasts and where to find them ???
Matpat, did something happen with the internet company again.
Just btw aquaman could destroy any other hero... with ease if you don't believe me just friggan google it
Christmas is Christian not Jewish
Or you could shoot him in the eyeball with a sniper rifle. I'm pretty sure it's just his skin that's bulletproof not his squishy corneas
*gREAT NOW WHERE'S THE THIRD DOCTOR WHO PART*
How much was baymax'es armor please
The best thing about watching MatPat's videos is watching his version or rendition of things I've learned in AP classes ... and actually understand it better here.
matpat, could you PLEASE make a video about Craster from Game of Thrones? because his children are all inbread so i was wondering howcome they can actually give birth to more children!
Poisoned fried chicken.
Nananannananannanana....BATPAT!!!!
1:33 Don't worry MatPat, we've all been there.
Why not him just drinking the enzymes?
Can't you like, just gas him?
You should do a theory on the movie Prestige and how they did their big magic trick of the transported man
didnt need to go that, you could always regular poison him or beat him in the head with a hammer till his brains are jelly
Or just shoot him in his eyes?
doesnt calcium carbonate have both covalent bonds and ionic bonds?
if he goes into a comma because of a shotgun gun blast to the face couldn't you like push him of a tall building and let the impact damage his brain. also he has impenetrable skin can his bone break.
PLEASE DO SAUSAGE PARTY!!!!!!!!!!!! AND MORE DRAGON BALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D loved your vids man
hey can you do a video about is it possible to create the jokers killer laughing gas
Lol aquamam just shot nemo and dory into sky
Random topic: Is it possible to calculate Dwight (from the TV series Office)'s networth?
transformers the las knight theory please
Or you can poison or drown him
So will matpat do a snoke theory?
Far easier is just to use chlorine gas or sarin.
You could do all of that stuff to weaken his skin... or you could just do the smart thing and shoot for a part that isn't covered by skin (i.e. his eyes)
ORRR YOU CAN DROWN HIM!!
How about Doctor Theryum
Sword  Art Online
Or you could just either: a) drown him b) suffocate him c) poison him  right?
I've never seen Luke Cage, but can't you just drown him?
You could just gas him only the skin is strong
It looks like Dr. theory strikes again
You should make a video about the ODM Gear from Attack on Titan and if it is possible to make in real life
5:30, well... we got better chicken wings  Mmmmmmm  *Juicy*
just choke him
0:11 that cringy spider man scene tho
BTS Conspiracy theories for the meaning of their album(s)?
if you shoot him in the mouth hes dead
You should do a theory about the cars world in disneys cars is twice the size of ours since the bilding can fit cars all the proof you need is in cars 2 when they are in the planr ext...
What about a pill sized bomb for him to swallow?
Am I the only person disturbed by the fact that you can buy viruses on the internet?
DO HOW DID BARRY ALLEN TURN INTO SAVITAR
just punch him in the face or gut realy hard concushun ruptured organs snapedneck all you need is force.  so in other words let the force be with youy.
Mad pat. That is now your super villain name.
How about.... Ya know... POISON!
Why are you so salty about aquaman 😂
He fell in a coma from a shotgun shot to the head. Pretty sure a strong enough strike would kill him
OMFG  HOW DARE YOU BRING UP YOUR INCREDIBLY FLAWED BATMAN V SUPERMAN VID
at 6:57 men have eyelashes too
This just looks like a very advanced jailbreak
Never thought I'd ask this but- Were those two atoms netflixing and chilling to HANNIBAL???
10:42 What fucking horse? Trojan?
Punch him with the iron fist
why not just poison him? He Has only hard skin.
if his only power is impenetrable skin, why not just push him down a flight of steps.
we're still all waiting for "can the doctor really exist?" ITS BEEN SO LONG!!!!! I'm sure some viewers might not even know you did two episodes on it
you might just drown him
you could call yourself bad pat
WHy don't just give him poison?
How does that zionist cock taste MP?
Y u dont just take a long needle and stick it up his nose and stab his fucken brain...if u can make it this far
Well, Time for a whole school sick day •^•
do a film theory on  "The Path"
Cant you just choke him?
MATPAT IS BATMAN IS DISGUISE. THINK ABOUT IT. JUST THINK ABOUT IT.
DO A THE STEVEN UNIVERSE
Netx episode of Film Theory: *Is Aqua Man really the worst superhero?*
I love your channel but if you ever diss Aquaman again I'm unsubbing faster than you can say sweet Christmas.
I didn't think I'd like this as much as I did. In the beginning I thought "Wow, Matpat is like Batman, he has contingency plans for everything." and eventually became "Wow, holy shit. I can get some common cold?"
Hey can you do a film theory on 13 reasons why
you know its WAY easyer - poison(food): poison atacks the cells and organs not the skin so.... yeah
he almost dies in jessica jones
Just drop a planet on him
or..ya know just give him a poisonous drink...
why not just try poison gas
cant you just shake him really hard? cuz that would like destroy his insides :D
So touching! Stef jiayou!!
if jj lin invited to this show, it would be great
Your clips are horrible for the volume. Please work on your sound editing. I have my tv volume on a 6 except when I watch these clips then I have to go up to 22. Fix yo whack clips please.
isn't a doner, street food in Berlin?
8:10 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hope that it fails. Just for the lolz.
Trump the Clown at it again.  _Odin approves this message. Zeus is undecided. Jesus is picking his nose and will be right back...
Mo Brooks can't be incompetent.  I think he's just saying anything to get behind trump so that trump will support later
liberals are such whiney babies.. oh and SNL is terrible so whoever watches it... there is much better material to watch than this over used, washed up show.. BTW I didn't vote for Trump
SHAAAAAAWWWWN!!!!
As a trump supporter i dont listen to what he says
lead good lives?! F*** you!
I live in WI - and totally agree with you.
Are there any Trump supporters here and if so, please state your reasons you support him?
obamacare is being repealed and placed
Now Trump is gonna calling you all fake media again.. Dame... feel sad for ppl who are gonna losing their health care
They passed it........................Gosh Sigh...............................................
he thinks everyone is as dumb as he is.. lolll
they're going to pass it.. no doubt .. and it's going to fk a lot of people
In the first week of Trump's presidency there was always a significant number of dislikes on videos critisizing Trump. Now those numbers have almost disappeared.
Sadly they passed the bill. I bet you there would be a lot of law suits in the future.
I'm noticing a trend: every republican in government is a fucking hypocrite liar asshole. strange. actually no that's who they are.
1 thing is clear.  black people are still cancer
This show would be dead if Hilary won
Comey is a liar. He could have revealed that the FBI was investigating Trump.
God bless Donald Trump.  And God bless America!
Come on Shawn!!!!  White House press is like a bunch of spoiled babies not getting their lollipop.
Seth is Rush Limbaugh disguised as a liberal.
"Trump flailing" at living up to his commitments?  He has already accomplished more than Obama counting all 8 years for Obama.
Comey speaks to Congress, but Rice runs away.  You know who the liar is.
Somehow if you have a preexisting condition is your fault, you lazy snowflake
Comey is full of BS!
Come on Sean! 😂😂😂😂
https://teespring.com/itachi-may-2017#pid=211&cid=5288&sid=front
Sorry, Seth you are not worth waiting for the add to finish! BYE!
president Toxic sludge
"As a Trump supporter I try my best to not pay attention to what he said". This is the best quote that should goes down in history.
John Spicer seems like the guy that sitting in his office and then someone commands him to sell to the press that Trump shooting a child is a good thing (figurativly speaking) and he goes out and suffers.
He's getting better. Best he can is much better than Best ever of all time
Lol so because I was born with Sickle Cell Anemia I'm not leading a healthy lifestyle and should pay more for healthcare?
Murica  Your Health = Privilege Guns = Your RIGHT
as a Canadian I can't believe a rich country like US doesn't have free healthcare for all. I've never even thought about it..just always been a right.
wow, people are straight up gonna die. They are going to kill people, and they don't care.
I saw that interview with Mo Brooks.  I was wishing throughout it that someone would walk past him and smack him in the head....HARD.
We need someone to give these rich bastards a reality check.
so joe walsh uses the same technique that he uses on his neglected kids?
Comey's defense of his actions was so fucking weak. Especially considering he was also several months deep into an investigation regarding Trump and Russia at the time.
Sound quality is bad again. FWiW
his administration is FULL of DONORS!!!
The reality is Trump wants to gather up all federal money in order to go to war with North Korea. End of story. He cares about nothing and no one else. God help us.
The republican party that abhors abortion  now raises the price on maternity care. Damned if you do  and damned if you don't.
Will I get more likes if I trumpshame?
this one was hilarious , at work laughing out loud.
Oh! My poor sweet children, born with Muscular Dystrophy!!  Oh my gosh, that senator actually said that out loud!... I want to throw up....
Is it just me or is Trump less orange?
Want a way to fix coal miners' health, let there industry die(from free market forces) and help them find jobs with fresh air.
Even the FBI can lie with confidence.
So Comedy felt it was so important to talk about HRCs emails and yet felt not compelled to inform the US voters about the long ongoing FBI investigation on Trump/Russia? Are you freakin serious????
LOL Seth 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hope there's a silver lining to the incompetence of this administration.
Am I the only one who thinks the videos have low volume ??
It would of been funnier if, when Trump asked "fellas, do you know what doners are?" one of them shouted, "YEAAAAAH!!! DONERS!"
Is it me? Or does Trumpty Dumpty seem even more clueless than ever? Jesus, Joseph and Mary, we are doomed.
Why are coal miners so important to Conservatives? Doesn't coal power less than 1 percent of the United States? Am I missing something?
Keep it up. You ROCK!   The only truth is the humor!  We need to STICK TOGETHER and #resisttrumpcare
is it just me or do the laughs sound fake? I mean it really does sound like a laugh track.
it takes a lot of stupid people to vote for such a stupid person
GOP: "Are there no prisons? No workhouses?"
those republicans are seriously messed up people.. with no morality and very little IQ.. it is truly amazing to watch.. good luck america
it might be better if the government spend money on peoples health care than of your fucking golf trips Mr President..
I'm sorry but I do want my Federal Government to care about my health! What, should I move to North Korea in order to get some attention Mr. President?
"Guy who drops bananas on the floor."  Trump can do that.
8:17 Just like how he doesn't pay attention to his child support bills
I'm a liberal but these conservatives make me happy my family is wealthy. Good luck Trump supporters.
We know what donors are, in trump case their RUSSIANS!
Man, I am glad I live in a country where healthcare isn't politics, it's just a thing we do.
i've had asthma from i was less than one year old. PLEASE enlighten me on how i must have lead a "bad life" for this to happen
lol singaporeans should kill each other off, bunch of uncivilised donkeys ,if they try this stunt in the U.S, they will get a headshot free of charge courtesy of being a bitch😆
This is what i called uneducated people in office attire.

That scumbag piece of shit should just kill himself,ps he is the guy that works at the -100 rating company.
i hate this :(
I think even my 5 y.o. cousin can behave better than these two spoiled brats.  They should just be forced to watch this act of theirs and be forced to read the comments section. Like if you agree.
This is a fucking disgrace to Singapore!!!! I am 12 from Singapore
they act like they own the place
stupid couple have no manners and respect towards to elderly
and then Roman Reigns song hits..

Singaporean cunts obviously had no upbringing. Instead of settling peacefully, decides to use force instead. His parents must be proud
I hope the quality of the video could be better. We need to see the fuck face of the pathetic couple.
Just when I thought Singapore was a boring country...
The real crime here is the vertical filming man. Come onnnnnnn
Rude af, nothing else to say about a guy who dares to hit the back of he old man like that. What if he has heart attack, not funny dude
I can't believe this! Singapore is supposed to be a harmony place.... Anyways Where is this place.. (i knw it is in Singapore...) °^°
if I was there I would took the seat and offer the old man to sit with me too...and then I would like to see what can the couples do about it..hahaha they are nothing but a bully...

Shameful,What an idiot pathetic...that man looking strong and cool in front of his babe😂 There's no sense of humour between this two idiots..Someday they will get instant karma,believe me
What a weak piece of coward shit he is.
Why the fuck that tough guy had to hit that old man for? What a fucken hero
The mother son only date on doing old man. if a guy full of Tatoo, he wouldn't dare one la
Old people should be respected. I guess without them, Singapore will never succeed, since theire the 1st generation of Singapore leh. Respect lah, ugly woman!
nice country , bad people #voteme2020
fucking bitch
what a rude behavior. An Old Man Is being bullied. the couple should be arested than the old man
no brain this stupid gross couples
black hearted this shamlezs couple
it seems they have been IDENTIFIED as a couple running education centre. the man also has some other business ventures. time to boycott those scums. especially the pussy who physically attacked an old man from behind.
yes low standard ppl ..both.disgusting
n strongly argue..does not mean can insult them...
Plot twist: guy wanted to fuck the uncle's backside... wife saw.... then scold the poor innocent uncle
Forever i hate Singaporean and i won't visit Singapore anymore.
he is obviously overcompensating for his scrawny ass by wearing a tight shirt and pushing the elderly around... sigh.
Singapore is crumbling from within ? Idk I'm just sayin.
typical cb showing he fierce to an old man
Did the police show up?
why cannot share? they think they book the food court and then reserve their shit
This is good,the sign of decadence.Pretty sure someday we will the downfall of Singapore
aiyo, seats also want to fight.. how old alr, just relax and find other seats la lmao. childish adults HAHAHA #HungryPeopleAreAngryPeople

Awww I've been watching on Facebook and YouTube FOREVER thank the lord she's giving birth!!!!!
yay, finally
YAY, she was born the exact same day I was. I turned 21 when she was born on the 14th of April.
You guys realize that most people that watched the giraffe cam will probably not go to the zoo where April is so no one will be able to see her ever again 😑😵🔥
39:34 mission failed, we'll get 'em next time
https://www.gofundme.com/rhf3bc-a-fresh-start

giraffe, my favorite animal giraffe. they are so adorable and so inoffensive, we must protect them
I love giraffes so much, they are so adorable and so innocent
A miracle from God!
Awe! At 3:23:03, Oliver's looking over the fence like, "OH MY GOD, THAT'S MY KID."
Oh my goodness how adorable
Why don't they name him after the ToysR us giraffe aka Jeffery bc they've sopncered them this whole time
i wonder how weird this would look in reverse lol
03:22:50  You can thank me now
3 hours 22 minutes  45 seconds.   plop
this baby is really cute
Her baby should be called Harry
49:45 What a moment, five seconds later!
Nice if Women got half this attention for the miracles they make all the time.  God is wonderful indeed/Nature.
wow very nice
This is not the real Animal Adventure Park site. This is a fake. The real one doesnt have any comment section except during Superchat times.
<3 what a beautiful little boo boo :')
if you want something new to watch there's a haunted Spork for sale on eBay right now.
what's wrong with that chick's voice? trying too hard to be cute or just plain annoying?
Mt Fuji looks really amazing
"And thuh bambewww" -Crystal 2017
I'm soo happy for you guys! :) I also love nature, there's a feeling you get while being around waterfalls that nothing can really replace. Now I have another place to visit in the future when I go to Japan n.n
wish we were with you we might have a flash flood 😓
Glad y'all are having fun in Japan :)
I wanna see you get lost :(((( :D
Almost 100% sure you won't run into Pandas or a 'Panda cave' in Japan, unless you visit a zoo. Their Chinese, not Japanese. Hope you're having a blast over there.
congrats on 600k on the main channel!
i love seeing the vides
i really liked cris' shirt. it had boba and other foods. yea for food.
How much days are you going to be there for
Awesome video, love the mt. fuji view and the waterfall, i love watching the adventure that you couples go to. ☺
you guys need a jetpack

that thing you thought was boba or tofu in your ramen is actually fish cake lol 😃 love that stuff
what time will you live stream claw machine Saturday
Angel back in Orlando Florida they have this restaurant called soupa Saiyan which is a dragon ball z themed restaurant. You guys should go check it out
I'm certain the bullet trains are empty most times because they're too expensive to ride on for the average person even Japanese citizens. Glad you guys got to ride it multiple times!
woah there was a nissan skyline at 4:51
I want to go swimming in those waterfalls we have something like that here in Oklahoma Dan and Davis Oklahoma and I've been to its call Turner Falls and we got to swim there and it was so nice

real madrid
Next time i will pay the ref 300.000£ we need to win this tournement. #Halamadrid
what are the names of commentators please.....thank you
wonderful- thank this best game
8:04 look at the goalies fingers😫😂
what's the name of the commentator?
Ronaldo FIFA 18 card shooting stats: Shot power: 96 Long shots: 92 Volleys: 89 Jumping: 95 Heading Acc.: 91
Wow what a game. Dani alvez beast
5:46 the rage scream
"Again he takes the game by the scruff of the neck and he makes it his little yo-yo!"
My, my! who are these commentators?! "Cristiano- let off the leash, and he comes out and sinks his fangs into Valencia and draws blood like Dracula!"
he takes the game by the scruff of its neck and makes it his little yo-yo.....this commentator is an idiot  and I give him the benefit of the doubt
who is the wanker commentator.....OMG....all his bullshit comments
Marcelo! Marcelo! MarcelooOOOOO
I think this time round the Fifa best player award has a new winner, Marcelo
Ronaldo is the god player bet Messi is the best
I think we should keep a clean sheet for all d coming features
Marcello is really the man to watch in RM now; no longer Ronaldo.
04:48 Cristiano is always pointing at something on the stands at the Bernabeu , i wonder what that is
the commentary is terrible
i dont know about u guys but the commentator on this video is  a comedian
"Marcelo takes the game by the scruff of the neck and makes it his little yo-yo" - Ray Hudson That Marcelo goal broke Barkalona fans hearts more than Valencia :D
I missed Ray Hudson <3 <3 <3 Magesterial <3
madrid are terrible
I love these 2 commentators ❤👏👏
If Marcelo didnt score referee would have to give Real another penalty
¡Follow us! News, Scores and games about the king of europe.
CR7 is the best ever
You mean 15💩💩 💩 ..well congrates for buying the ref all of time its a nice club🖒🖕🖒🖕
Ronaldo is overrated and Marcelo is underrated like if u agree
that zidane laught on 2:1 :)))))))))))))))
Someone tell this idiot, Raymond Hudson, that the word is ''majestic'', not ''majesterial''. And English is supposed to be his mother language...
Marcelo is the star of real madrid not ronaldo. Marcelo defend attack create beautiful chances
Dracula, Vampire, Blood, Tiger, Fangs, this guy is a little nutty.
i fucking hate this commentator
Anyone else enjoy the Scot's commentary more than the game? His metaphors are killer 😂
Zizou please let Morata plays more often. He's sharper than Benzema now I believe
Does Zidane have to play Benzema every time only because hes french
It's time for Morata to start the games.
HALAMADRID......I LOVE YOU
Even WWE is more realistic than Modric's penalty.
thanks so much Marcelo
Marcellooooolololololololo
marcelo should be player of the season in madrid.. ronaldo, benzema and bale was truely a disappointment this season ..
wow, like giving dracula the blood transfusion. what a nice selection of word
why is bale getting injured alot??
"magisterial"  -_-
did he just say Ronaldo has chromosome swimming around his body like a Bengal tiger?
That commentator is a poet
Penaldo can't even score from penalties anymore hahahahahahahahaha
lol that irish commentator is straight hardcore lol he took poetry in high school
wtf is with that voice...WTF, it's so fuking annoying
Parejo's goal=Real Madrid's 90min
1:58 what is this? xD
The commentator is obsessed with Dracula
ARRRECHO MARCELO
The commentators are so enthusiastic !
Nacho is wortless
I love your channel it is the best highlight channel
Roberto Carlos=Brazilian=Madrista=LB Marcelo=Brazilian=Madrista=LB Both of them are leagend..........Also a Great LB.........
the commentator is on FIRE....
This was a very good movie.. great cast, great acting. Thank you for sharing this movie. Looking forward to watching many more! By the way Loving your channel.
Thanks 4 this you the real MVP lol i hope youtube don't try to take yo videos down cause you know they be on that BS Sometimes with that  copyright and stuff.
This channel does good movie's, but this was not one of them...awful😑
it goes to show you that there's no honor amongst thieves lol
that lady from soul food is fine but her crying is annoying l😭l
it was okay, but really low budget movie..
I hate movies that don't get anywhere and when they try they still get nowhere.
Thanks for posting these great movies!!!!
lol......definitely no Ghanaian accent there
ty, hope to see more:)
This movie need some work. You find your sister dead but you don't call medics? 
Wow, so one would have sex with a man they just met 10 mins ago. That scene messed the entire movie up. 
nice movie thanks keep them coming 😊
Wow..lots of mic shots in this movie
I will watch every single one of them that you put. thanks
i love this movie. Janet
He's been crooked since "Soul Food" lol

Please keep'em coming. I'm an avoid movie collector but I honestly have never seen any of these selections of movies until now, thank you so much for them!
I love this channel!
thank U again Peace
ayye will be watching this tonight keep em coming
If I had to play this with earphones on alone I would probably feel like crying. Looks awesome though it is a well done jumpscare game.
Every time he says baby I say "baby baby baby ohhhhh!"
yeah most review vids for this game died on that first step hahaha
Shart puddle
Watched MatPat played this during GTLive but I just have to watch Pewds play it since the first one helped me find him
So u scared and stayin in the comment section huh?
Outlast 2 or Resident Evil 7?
Wanna know who has a better playthrough of this? Dashie Games baby.
Hey pewds nextime when you have that moment when you saw that crazy old lady on the window might just record it when that sony camcorder of yours
you are lol
"Is god in this game? That's awesome!"
count the "we're fine"😂
Hey chicken
Guys what u think what game is better? Resident Evil VII BioHazard  or Outlast 2?
I'm the biggest baby tbh, lol i can barley even WATCH him play. fml.
I liked the video while taking a shit. No offence!
11:00 I've been waiting for this moment!!!!! 😂😂
poods you're literally the best, you make all the scary ass games less scary by adding those silly comments and i wanna thank u for that, you make my life less stressful
pewds long enemy barrels is now his friend
hahaha this is so hilarious
Dat Mouse sensitive
when the mornigs gone and you cant go on batteries
you forgot to turn on the subtitle :D!
who else watched this with low volume
So annoying
Pewdiepie how much old you want to retired on your passion.
I've been playing through it myself and when he called that flash of light a "god fart" total ruined that for me now. 😂😂
I JUST WANNA KNOW WHERE THAT BITCH GOES
Why you do not review the first 2 footage?
You forgot to activate the subtitles.
BOX! Save station, gotta get to the save station. Batteries!
How many of you guys are waiting for Pewds to play this since 3 years
17:10 hey howd you doin LMAO
Part of me also died when pends said you can't watch his scare pewdiepie season 2 Ep on outlast anymore ....
Grass is good Grass is great Be like Grass.
Excited to watch this 👶
This is the reason why i started watching him in 2013 because of the first outlast gameplay by pewdiepie! YEESSSS!!! I have waited so long!!! "BATTERIES!! and the mornings gone and you can't go on without batteries" :')
A lot of pomp and circumstance and annoying noises....I don't get what people see in Pewdie....not at all......DashieGames or UberHaxorNova, much more entertaining
Who else sang the battery song as soon as you saw the battery? I can't be the only one who was around for outlast 1...
11:18 scared the piss out of me
LETS FUCKIN GOOOOOOOOOO HELLL YEAHHHHH PEWDS FUCKKKK YEAHH HYPED
12:23 what do you mean you forgot about the jump scare as if you knew it was gonna be there? he totally watched videos on it before playing
In america I believe the locker in middle school are small, high school,, Idk, I think it depends which one
That thumbnail creeps me out!
When a jump scare comes and you scream and wake everyone up in your house in the middle of the night 
What bout part 2-3??!
Okay. Tell me why this man loses his glasses EVERY time he falls and then conveniently finds them 2 inches away.
WHERE IS THAT GUY WHO COMMENTS THE TIMESTAMPS FOR JUMPSCARES ;-;
my name is jeff
Why would you skin someone alive?Maybe he really likes to eat skin  ***Mind=Fucked
she is 100% percent fucked up
such a shame that so many good youtubers are getting vids de-monetised. I think they way to go now is live stream everything on twitch then upload streams to youtube later as a secondary source
Hey pewdiepie are you speaking jibberish or Swedish if your speaking Swedish then what are you saying
At 11:09 pewdiepie said the best commentary right after talking about BATTERIES!!!!
I get freaking heart attacks every 2 seconds from this but I still wanna watch it
"maybe somebody who likes to eat skin ya know..." he kills me L O L
Watching someone else play a horror game because your too pussy to play it yourself
my name is Jeff Goldblum
Where are all the jumpscares people? It's been a week!! Tell me
12:23 . why we loved pewdiepie
"Bald man! What did you do to Jessica?" Me: "Foreshadowing..." *whistles*
kill all blonde headed  poo poos
You know it's fiction, because you have journalists doing actual journalism.
wasup all my gamer my name is REAGAN DIE
"Why is my hair so fkn anime 2day?" proceeds to look like trunks
falls from helicopter, lives falls from slight cliff, dies
pewdiepie ur so ridiculous gamer i can't playy it anymore
"oh shit. the fuck's that sound?"  *screams in the background*  "shit that does not sound bueno"
FINALLY I CAN SEE A DAMN GOOD GAMEPLAY
About the lockers thing: I know Pewds! like, in Europe our lockers are half the size of theirs! How unfair.
''Hopefully this series won't get demonetised'' **video gets demonetised*
You guys get half the size? Bish please. In Ireland we get four times the size, and of course since it only rains we also need huge ass jackets to stuff in
its SPATLIN not SONY lol
stop wasting  your lantern pewds
interesting
Would I have had to watched the first one to understand the storyline of the second?
your sarcasm is goals :D :D
damn seems like these are 5 minutes videos..btw nice game until now.
asan na part 2?
plz help me god i feel so alone i am just a kid i can't take it at my own so please mister bully tell me what i have done you know i have no dad i am living with my mom
I think I'm in love with Brian tbh
Love this song <3
In love with this song, so good!
I'm actually crying like wow. This came in such a great time.
VERY APPRECIATE  IT,.MY FIRST TIME EVER SEEN,.REALLY NICE ONE!::))
omg why do pvris have the effect to it parts of the soul that hurt and bring memories from the past flooding back to the surface
love this band so much when I first heard the fist single and Lyndsey Gunnulfsen is beautiful
I already love it first listen so you already know it's going to be an obsession
2 new videos from Paramore a new one from HAIM and now I found this one from PVRIS that came out a 4 days ago. This month is shaping up to be a great month for music I like.
When Lyndsey signs "you took my heaven away" , it feels like she's addressing me that I have done something incredibly wrong ....... Bloody hell I'm just feeling sorry just by listening to the song.......
paramore, pvris, nickelback, imagine dragons, fall out boy, blackbear, i cant take this much nee songs!!!
ah my favourite villain, the teapot of darkness
One of the best bands lyrically
Yeah some piece of shit disguised as a so called man took my heart and isolated me for years.
My little gay heart is in love over and over again 🖤
Her haircut is bad.
someone took the light from my eye's as well
my mum is concerned for my life. i've been listening to this song on repeat since it was released :/
I love how Lynn sings from her chest, deep in her throat. She pulls it right up out of her soul. It's so beautiful.
Lynns voice has gotten so much stronger and I love it. Her vocals have always been amazing but holy shit goosebumps the whole entire song I'm so asdfghjkl
before 1 million
Am I the only one saddened when seeing Alex, Brian, and Lyn dead in this? 😔
Am i the only one that can barely hear lynn?? she's mumbling on the verse's
I've had this on repeat since it dropped they never fail to disappoint me 😭😭
My ears are singing along with me 🌈❤✨ AMAZING!!!!
i already love it before its over
The new album will be on my dad's 10th death anniversary and near my 21 birthday. It's very symbolical for me. Thank you, your band is the best thing that happened in my life. Bless you all :)
happen to be wearing a PVRIS shirt
obsessed with this song
i love pvris and this new song is so lit omg
all i can say is WHATTTTTTTT??!!!!!! I WASNT READY
I saw these guys at iMatter 2014 before they got their label and I must say they have grown so much! her voice has changed and it sounds so amazing.
Watched this after a fight with my mom. I feel better already, bc this song kind of describes our relationship. Can't wait for the new album :)
My friend who passed a way a little over a year ago loved pvris and would have fallen in love with this song
why can i only like this once?
i'm so glad WWE used Fire for a PPV theme last year. Never would've heard the amazing sounds of the band if not for them.
The biggest diva is on my channel
I'm surprised no one is talking about how much double sided tape that blazer must have taken... I was honestly stressed out watching that, I was so sure it was gonna slip.
i think they are gonna be big in 2018 i see it ☺️
im so proud, definitely worth the wait.
It's weird how both Lynn and Christina Grimmie sound the same.
I have never been a hardcore PVRIS fan, but after hearing this, I may need to change that 😍😍😍
Either my eyes are trippin or I've watched this way too many times it's unhealthy, but at 3:13 there is definitely a butt cheek and suspenders on the mystery figure taking the photo?? 😂🙊🙈
oh my gosh cant wait for the new album <3 <3 <3
Never considered myself a fangirl.... then I realised that that high-pitched noise was, in fact, myself.
THANK YOU for this amazing masterpiece. I will always love you.
THANK YOU for this amazing masterpiece. I will always love you.
I think i am at least half of these views
i missed them so much!
i want lynn to fuck me gently with a chainsaw bye
How are they on rise records it's a metal label mostly...
I thought the acronym for the new album was the actual album title and I tried very hard to sound it out haha
Not a fan of this new single honestly
so much new music, first para more, then atl, then fob and now pvris ❤️❤️
the new album comes out 4 days before my bday :::::::::::OOOOOOO
Pure art this. It's just so damn good.
saw them live when i saw fob and they were pretty good but it was hard to hear
I love this
Saw this on trending and immediately fell in love
This is a good year for music. First Paramore then Pvris! Finally something to listen to.
she took mine and dis more than break it. She deatroyed everything. i miss her
I was supposed to see them in Paris this monday but unfortunately I can't :( it will be for the next time !
everything about this is perfect.
Anybody else think this song kinda sounds like Fade Away by We Came As Romans?
This song.. The video.. It's perfection omg
I'm feeling even gayer because of lynn's hotness in this video 😍
she took your heaven away....
i need more!!!!!!!!
She reminds me of Dolly Parton in a lot of ways.
It's hard for this band to do anything wrong musically
Never failing to impress 👌
watch my video here #nKD8e8lYZPQ
heaven hello from abq new mexico!
I hate that every time i watch this the number on trending gets worse Its upsetting how people dont know what real talent is
The new paramore
WWII is a very serious topic one could make a breathtaking game about, actually. But this trailer shows up one more time, that cod producers cant fellow with dices bf series at all. Just as expected, embarassing.
thank you call of duty for making this game
this is bf1....
This game looks class
why the  hell do they have to release this and red dead redemption 2 at same time?? so dumb
this is the coolest Call of Duty ever
Why do people either have to be BF1 fans or CoD fans? Two different wars, get both and enjoy! I'm a BF1 player and this game actually makes me want to play CoD again.
TURKISH LANGUAGE SUPPORT WANT !!!
cod world at War remastered
Can't wait for the Hiroshima DLC
They copied battle field
i cant wait to be hitler and dab.
I'm a fan of BF1 and I have an big erection
wow wow wow. just amaezing. I love Call of duty from my heart
wow bf1 crazy and hope hitlers dont win
Best game in my opinion
battlefield 1 got destroyed      let the hate come in because it's true....
Welcome to bloody first you're far way away from Texas farm boy
Fans We Have A Surprise For Everyone <3      Just search google for   gift4fans1337
cod  world at hype
I hope there will be something with Poland
Is it just me or y tf isn't this video working 'play back error '
80K Dislikes! why? we finally get what most of us want.
So Cool! I am define tell going to live stream this when I get it
1:25 battlefield 1 fans
People Dis Like Bc they dont know how to play cod
How did the feud between BF fans and COD fans start?  In the comments I keep seeing, "All the dislikes are BF fanboys" or this is a copy of BF1.
Hitler should of won war
Finally they got the oldness back into their heads.
Let's wait for ww3 then a few weeks later one of these fools will try to drop ww3 first Im ready for the trailer 😂
I cant wait for the beta launch
I like COD campaign but I like BF multiplayer.
battle feild 1 is better no hype about this game
So you say COD WW2 is historically accurate will there be Indians fighting alongside the British army.
http://www.gofundme.com/3qm33w0
Wow. So much "actual gameplay footage" I almost forgot there were cutscenes.
this will be good
I'm getting it to day as a preorder
I didn't see 1 marking on German soldiers. Good to know this game got sucked into the generation of the easily offended.
yes back to the good cod
Just hope they don't make out America won WW2 by them self.
No zombies at the end?.... hello?.... ok no zombies, not my kind of game
Is there gunna be Navajo Code Talkers in this game?📞
is doss in there
Once again, we get a boring interactive movie, instead of a video game. You can't even hide it. This trailer is 0% gameplay.
is this coming out on the ps 3?
why does COD always try and copy what Battlefield is doing, Battlefield chose the first world war so COD didn't want to be too obvious so they chose the second
Hope they won't just write a bunch of scripts scene instead of fluent interactions in combat. Seems not much in multiplayer.
I'm going to fap with that
Cod: we need something to compete with battlefield 1.   And if we leave the future and we go to the second war !?  Cod: Ascended!
this is such a rip off of battlefield why can't COD make it's own ideas
This video have more like than the infinite warfare.
this is going to be the best one
WTF!!! IS THE BEST TRAILER WHAT I SEEN EVER.LIKE IF YOU LIKE THIS TRAILER LIKE ME
first cod copy halo than battlefield
Spoilers : the Germans lose....
pre-ordered it I'm so excited for this
Good to see it go back. Can't wait to get some reviews done. Be sure to check them out.
Finally normal COD
"GET YOUR HEAD DOWN AND KEEP MOVING!" That part brings me back to the old days of COD and gives me goosebumps
at 1:15 is that vin diesel?
the trailer is kinda like Fury The Movie
This game comes out in November 3hrd My birthday is November 12 perfect birthday gift
Sometimes I forget that this is COD :D
WWII? Again?  mkay, no cod for me this year
can you put more of tank please
So you copy battlefield thats how your gonna play it
yoooo I ain't played COD in years but that's bout to change is lit
Battlefield 1
Hitler will join this game
LETS MAKE COD GREAT AGAIN
Supply drops confirmed.
Oh look, it's Medal of Honor Frontline in HD with more cutscenes
Altho i dont like Hitler tbh he saved cod
Everyone remember this... In 2 years time everyone will want a futuristic game again, and then it'll become a cycle
so true LOL
actual in-game cutscene footage
cool awesome game
Let's go cod

You white people go to Mexico to and eat pizza? Jesus christ go back to the states!!!
That's so Marc...trying to sneak in the unhealthy food!
great video, beautiful picture
Love your videos!  Love your sense of humor too!
Your videography skills are really getting good. Even the non-"return home" shots :-)
Why did John give you his hat at 4:10?
Just love your videos and how adventurous you guys are and how your kids are embracing it all!  You guys must be exhausted at the end of those days, must take a lot of stanima!! 😜
what kind of drone do you fly?
This is such a great video!  The quality, shooting and editing are TV Travel Show worthy!  :)  Avid watchers here!  <3
Did I see that right, about $200 USD for the dress?
Amazing videos. By any chance can you guys say how good or bad is Guadalajara wheelchair accessible?
lol you're kids are so nice to ppl
You guys are great
Great video :)
The drone footage is the best, you guys didn't try tortas ahogadas? They are the most famous food in Jalisco.
The drone footage is AWESOME!!!!!!!!   Did you see that patio on top of the building in the last segment - pretty cool.
It never fails, a few seconds in and I'm grinning ear to ear ... right to the end.  You guys are très entertaining.  Thanks. 🤗
Did that guy in the dress store really tell you off for filming? lol
That Video Was Awesome!!!   Thanks for the virtual Tour of Mexico!! Happy Trails Guys...!!
Love your videos, by the way.  I am not a young person anymore, so it so good to see you young people doing many of the things I did back in the day. Thank you for the adventures.
The "stanima"?  I'm a linguist. Sorry.
Amazing Dorn shots! Did you pick up a new gopro, I just got the 5 and I'm worried about how really "water proof" they are.
are you in an i-hop commercial
That near miss with the drone was a pretty incredible and gorgeous shot! :O
You guys are fabulous!  We are buying a trailer this month to live in Oklahoma while I go to graduate school.  Have truly enjoyed your videos!
Great video! I just love you guys- really a fun little family- with a plan! lol~
Awesome video, one of the best yet!!  Get drone shots and excellent background music!  Enjoy your adventures, keep them coming.  Thanks!
The quality of your videos is excellent! Thank you for sharing with us.
Wow! Best video editing yet...especially the drone footage, well worth the wait. till the next one. You guys have so much fun in everything you do, thanks again for sharing it with us.
You guys are awesome. I just love your videos
love watching you're videos
AWSOME Episode.  You guys were totally out of control (Funny).  My Dad was born in Guadalajara.  That is a place that is on our bucket list.
I thought you said, "Do you scratch when you get up?" And he said, "Yeah, I scratch!" Ha ha! Stretch, scratch . . . all the same.
Drone footage was amazing! Also hello from Canada🇨🇦 eh
LOL it's so funny. Guys are always putting moves on Trish. The more I watch your family the more I realize that you are a very special bunch of people. What great fun it is to follow along.
Nicely done. Video editing is superb! Thanks for sharing your adventures best channel on you tube. You guys are blessed!
Great video. On my list of places to go. What app is that on the phone that lets you translate written words from Spanish to English? Its at 751 on this video.
What are you all up to at the moment of reading this comment?
You guys are an amazing family! best of all you're showing my home town. Saludos desde Seattle. New subscriber.
LOL Housekeeping! You guys are so enjoyable. What drone do you have? The DJI Phantom 3?? Also are you using an IPhone for the viewer? Jim
ya'll are makin me hungry
Dump the F150 get a Ram with Cummings
Looked like a nice place. Did everyone enjoy it ?
Love the video.  Motivates us to get out almost every weekend.  Just got back from Moab and already planning the next weekend.  Keep living the dream.
Love watching your videos... They're all amazing. Keep them coming! 👍🏼
I'm hooked. I absolutely love your videos. The editing is terrific.
I triple thumbed up for the drone footage!!!!
OK. I officially want to be adopted by your family! You guys are so funny 👍🏻. Another amazing video. I've always want to go to Guadalajara and your video just proves why. It is amazing!
Love the shopping "stanima" conversation....u guys are hilarious 😂
What as the app you had on your phone while you were getting coffee before you talked about New York
Dying laughing with the boys at the hotel.
Hi guys, loved the video, the editing and drone footage was great. What an amazing city. And such generous parents for the prom dress! Looks gorgeous Thank you for taking us with you  Take care xxx
so about $207 for the dress? is that a good deal? asking for a friend with two daughters that he'll have to buy prom dresses for in the next few years...
is stanima Spanish for stamina?  #winning
Do not fly your drone,  No Pigeons will be like bumper cars
What a lucky girl to get to buy a Mexican dress for prom. So what did that equal in us money?
thank you, totally enjoyed.
As always an excellent video. Thanks for posting, I always enjoy them. 31 days and counting now. Keep on, keepin on.
Amazing drone footage.
The drone footage was epic to say the least. The editing is sick as well. Great job guys!
Knock knock  .... "who is it"  ..... "Housekeeping"  (didn't know a male voice could go that high) :-)
Amazing city guys. So much fun watching your family.
I have to agree with a pp, just gets better and better! Keep up the great work! and Have Fun!
I enjoy your videos so much its ridiculous!
I think this is my favorite video yet. I was in the Soviet Union in 1987 for a month and murals of their history was everywhere along with Puskin poems . Wonderful.
How far is this vlog into your Mexico trip / when will Season 3 start? also btw i loved this video! ❤️
The kids are entertaining, I love them. That real sculpture was great.
Fuck demo discs. Just get to the porn. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
It is a movie he's right
that was my first OXM demo disc from my 360
shit dude... my level design teacher made that iron man game. He never got to do anything he wanted in that development
they all have such nice tiddies
Eric Andre show of games 😆
Wasn't this called 'Planet 34'?
I loved Split Second, great racing game from Disney Interactive. And I love how James teases Adam with it, before handing him a disk of garbage.
Who else noticed that the title of the video changed?
What a toss
i miss septic (please make him permanent on the show)
Welcome to Blast Up! The worst show on YT!
Thanks for asking my Google Home a question, lol  You should throw one of those in every vid :P
I really liked Bruce's imitation of Anime openings
What happened to the title? I really liked the 34 joke.
Planet 34 was such a great title. What made you guys change it? Copyright?
oh .... I had all of these games ... except the one game that actually looked cool
Didn't expect resonance of fate gameplay. Man makes me wanna plug my ps3 back in
i love you guys! so wanna tongue Elyse's asshole tho. Sorry guys, but you need for of her.
I got an advertisement!!!!! never been happy about it before!
ERIC ANDRE SHOW REFERANCE!!! FUNHAUS IS GOD!!!!
can you guys do a video with all 3 of you are matching??
Wtf are those HL explosive barrels with legs?
someone else really needs to be playing.
i got my first handjob to planet 51
Started watching this series freshmen year of college. I've graduated now.
End of Eternity/Resonance of Fate is an amazing game btw
Ads on a rule 34(demo disk) video. what is this? 2012?
To the people who watch this live, do you get to see Rule34 uncensored?
so after X360 Demo Disk its going to be Original Xbox Demo Disk but wat then after that?
Bruce Please please please start singing agin  And please make Matt Peak dance
Ain't nothing sweeter than that Valhalla puss
That first game is the worst piece of shit Ive ever seen. Anyone who liked that deserves to die and go to hell.
Quality content by you guys as always. One of the highlights of my evening. Love it!!
I hope I'm not he only one who sees a pinch of Spoole in this episode.
lmao who else went to watch the trailer?
Adam's face when he remembered the Iron Man game was epic.
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that Bruce perfectly bit Adam's mic with that lob? Bruce join the NBA so the bulls can finally have a starting point guard. #funhauswontunderstandbasketballreferences
Should play Split/Second as a video
Resonance of Fate (End of Eternity) is the only good game. Literally the only good game ever made.
Elect James Willems 2020 "Make Mickey Free Again!"
When people keep saying "Wow look how good at games Adam is!" make sure to link them to this video.
man oh man! I sure do love me some Demo Disk
I miss the creepy XBOX.
Is it just me or does the guy doing the voice over for the Area 51 trailer sound like the guy who voiced Dallas in Payday?
"SpaceMan says everybody look down. It's all in your mind"
Not gonna lie, I have the Fairytale Fights and Split Second Demo Disks in a drawer somewhere.
FUNHAUS PLAY SPLIT SECOND, trust me we will love😭
Guys you fucking made it TRENDING!
it was cool how we got to see a rwby season 9 sneak peak in this demodisk
I actually played Fairytale Fights years ago, it was a very repetitive game
James would go far if he ran for gov them calicucks love free things
Adam's laughing cures blind babies.
Resonance of Fate
Get Eric Andre on an episode
I'm with Adam on that first game.
Kinda happy Boxy didn't show up. That thing creeps me out
I love this channel
That fairytale fights game looks kind of fun.....
End of Eternity is actually "infamous" for it's combat system. Many including it on lists of games with the hardest combat systems, but they say it's really fun if you can do the amazing sometimes frameperfect combos.
is it sad that I still play only Xbox 360
That mic-bonk from the disk was amazing.
Split/Second IS a great game. Cruel, cruel James playing with our emotions.
Nothing like watching you guys surf Rule 34 while I'm in school
Planet 51 was actually really awesome film to watch!
Dear Adam, please learn how to video game. Thank you. ;)
oh man James mentioned the killers and I haven't listened to them in a long night time I might have to look them up again
Somehow Bruce looks bald and not at the same time
Adams gameplay just FRUSTRATES ME
Okay I might have to go dig out my ps3. Watching them play End Of Eternity gave me a huge nostalgia boner.
1:20 was an unexpectedly satisfying noise
I watched this episode immediately after I watch a bunch of the Eric Andre Show. Huh.
The Killers - Spaceman is a good song
hay Bruce i just want to know do you shave your legs?
All of them are wearing the same coloured shirt. I like it.
That edge of eternity game has a notoriously complicated combat system
Fuck you for teasing us with split/second
they are all healthy fit dudes sure. but god damn i dont there theres ever a moment that james doesnt have perfect posture.
who just skips to when they go on rule 34? is it just me?
Today is my birthday. Instead of going out.. I decided to watch Funhaus videos alone. Happy 32nd Bday to me. Thank you for all the good times.
Being drunk and wattching Demi disk iz the bat way to to experience Funhaus yeeeeeah
Getting blazed and watching Funhaus is one of the most beautiful things
 End of Eternity is Resonance Fate in America. that game I never beat. was epic and had quite a few funny moments.  Teen Titans, Robin played one of the mains characters, Zypher. haha
Blast up? Nah, It's all about SNAIL DOWN!
Split/Second was the shit! I remember playing the hell outta that game.
Someone need to pitch Lawrence a show idea where he makes Adam play these insanely deep JRPG like The Last Remnant Resonance of Fate and Knights in the Knightmare.
thats brave, they look up porn in the normal tabs. You guys arethe unsung heroes.
I love the killers
Man, how I wish this show was 20 minutes long.
they watch the eric andre show! now thats rad if I've ever seen it

An absolute masterclass...poetry in motion... a thorough professional you are Chris!!!
this video was really satisfying to watch. keep up the good work!
hey,Chris!I was just wondering when are you making the ,,gutting the interior"video ? i am not trying to bug you like everyone else,trust me,  i was just wondering.
I hate cops but whenever they do these type of things I hate to admit it but they're real life heroes man
the cop later shot the black man.....
Can you change the title from "from pond" to "from drowning" lol
that other officer like fuck boi I don't wanna get wet
Lowkey the officer was only there to shoot up the black guys for resisting arrest.
Police are good people! Depends on who your dealing with
Good thing those people were fighting I guess or else the kid might be dead.
0:17 Hi, can you guys tell me what is that sound in almost every video?
Won't see this on fear mongering main stream media!! It's just to positive and unfortunately humans are only entertained by violence and death!!
Deserves the biggest medal ever
How did the officer know where the kid was? Was someone too afraid of jumping in the pond.
we must stab the pond, like how Adam WEST STABBED THE OCEAN. lol
Good job officer
It was so dramatic but the water was only 1 feet deep. The poor kid got scared by the police because he know he was wearing a body cam.
I don't know why I chuckled when the cop had to ask someone to call 911 for him lmao
I wish I can see more of what happened, but props to that officer!!! Great to see someone walking past dive in and help out. Sucks that things like this won't make it onto the news.
should have removed it from the gene pool.
this is why we need the officers
WHO THE FUCK DISLIKED THIS?
Good job Officer! Now let's wait for the internet trolls to say it's fake or some dumb shit.
Good cop, but because the kid was wearing black, BLM will be here any minute
2 dislike A black person and a feminist does not like this video
The kid was pretending he was playing with Julia from Sesame Street.
See what happens when you vaccinate...now the ponds are swallowing people whole.
Good job Officer
Good job sir! that kid could of been dead if you weren't there !
Why do all videos start without audio?
call 911 for me, nigga you are 911 😂😂😂
Wouldn't surprise me if people started bashing on this officers pd for pedophilia.
Nothing said in the comments section about the white parents who they couldn't reach, probably smoking meth and creating an inbreed child
whats he doing in the pond then m8 lol
So no props to the black guy who helps out???
His parents are the autistic ones. Where the hell are they?
What's wrong with Kansas? Nothing.
God bless you, officer!
But wait, cops are suppose to be terrible human beings!
The parent's should be charged for child negligence.
bad cops out there? we have good officer too .. ! blue lives matter !    red fire fighters  to. BLUE-L-M &  R-L-M
Awesome job!
God bless the police heroes.
that pond could have killed him. theyre too dangerous and need to be outlawed!
I bet stevenfromtexas would have been happier if the cop let the kid die.
Good bless you brother What an excellent job you did there Thank you for your service overall!
I want a fucking Libtard to fucking debate me right fuckin now and tell me why they hate cops!
this cop was exhausted after running 20m.  it takes him minutes to recover his breath from a 10 second jog. wtf man u fat as fk
The kind of video that makes grown men tear up
Fucking autists
I'm sure the "cop haters" will ignore this one.  Nihilists seem to detest any form of decency.
This is why water should be banned
Autistic is the new retard
Fucking autismo.
what they dont show you on tv
I'm surprised he didn't shoot the pond for attacking that child
75 likes 0 dislikes. This is what people want from cops. Even the trolls liked this lol. Don't think I've ever said that
This won't be on the news most likely
if you dislike this video your heartless jerk
But this video will never make the news because you know fuck police
The cop seems stunned
and there are people just standing there watching the kid drown. yay humans
Good save literally
What parents thought it was a good idea to let their little retard go for swim? (LOL)
Hates off to that amazing cop!
YEEAAAHHHHHHHHH.........
Clips like this allways make me shed a tear
Just cause he fell in the pond doesn't make him autistic.
and ignorant  people wanna say fuck police.
You are an amazing person! Much love! Thank you for saving him!
god bless this officer. i have 2 on the spectrum and this is one of my biggest fears
This is why cops are awesome!
Damn, that was a good save - perfect timing.
I watched and liked it💚

This is like an interdimensional TV ad.
Could be arson. Just saying.
That's horrible. I was just there yesterday. Electrical malfunction maybe.
What are scarf sounds?
In this episode, the grumps help deliver a lost child to her parents.
"oh are you her real father? I've been looking for you..." PLEASE TAKE HER AWAY OR PAY ME MONEY TO KEEP HER. SHE KEEPS CHUCKING HER LEGO EVERYWHERE AND I STAND ON IT
What if Ross prerecorded all of the doodle videos in the past in case something happened to him and he couldnt be on Gamegrumps?
Paper mario is dead... until they remember it in like 1 year, then they'll play it just a bit and forget about it...   And the cycle will continue

"Hey kid, you wanna smoke a pot?" Arin Hanson 2017
Goddamn these let's players, they make me buy games just to avoid spoiling them, because I want to watch, but games like this I want to experience for myself. Ahh, my wallet.
YOU GUYS USE WINDOWS DEFENDER THAT SHIT DONT WORK

They should play outlast 2
"weirdest thing to save at" huh? how about a crow or a urinal  or a fire made of bones or a tv screen or even a bell?
I am waiting for a game that Dan plays where I don't immediately figure out the puzzle and watch him struggle-bus for five minutes trying to figure out something blatantly obvious to me.
Edge wood? Isn't that the guy from Ace Attorney?
That goddamn windows notification for windows defender made me think it was my PC for a second. lol
I haven't seen Kevin in forever, where's he at?
why is it they say someone has a British accent and its actually a English accent cause British accents could be other accent too like Scottish Irish and welsh
This reminds me a bit of infinity train
also you definitely played this with Ross. way to go, Arin
1:37 that's a Bible verse​!
would reaper call his shlong edge wood ?🤔
the girl sounds like peppa pig
You can study 6 years and become a doctor or you can make 1 game in that time!
You guys really did like Steam Train? I can't stand Ross and Steam Train wasn't entertaining at all  Edit: Kevin wasn't a big deal when he left either 
3:10 Is that a fireplace... with a window... on a train?
i remember playing Thomas brush's previous game called Coma which is kinda similar
I need this game to have a happy ending.
Why's the quality so low
Jackaboy!!!!!!!!!! Woo!!!!!!!!!    Oh yeah and pewdiepie....
2:00 - At least Windows Defender likes this game. :)

"What are scarf sounds?"                     -Dan Avidan, 2017

Arin reminds me of the little lad who loves berries and cream.

Does anyone know who voices Mr. Pinstripe? I've been looking for a voice like his for a while.

Rip he forgot Ross
PLAY LITTLE NIGHTMARES YOU HOES!!!!!
Disappointed that Dan isnt voicing Bo
@11:50 Whoa. I'll...be in my bunk.
We all float down here...
When your British and you hear an impression 😏😓
Why you doin' Specter Knight like this?
dear gamegrumps, I want to give a suggestion of a game that you guys may find interesting. Its called my little nightmares.
I've been waiting for this since the first time they played this. My body is ready.
i wish kevin was playing this instead...
Ross is in your dreams, like Freddy Kruger?
Is is just me or is the audio mixing getting more and more unbalanced?
God, I have been so excited for this play through since I finished the game myself
this isn't paper Mario finish a series you attention deficit dill holes
I have been playing this in Newgrounds...its a pretty great game...
You know what, I think I'll stop watching here. I sense this is a game I'll want to play
0:05 INFINIDAGGER!!!
why are you guys not doing any more Paper Mario! 😭😤
ahhhhhhhhh hek! i wanna play this
Yay! its done now?! :D
Such a riveting game.....  nngh....
welcome to not paper mario
"what are scarf sounds?"
Sometimes seeing Dan try to figure out puzzles makes me wonder if he's ever played a video game before.
Baby's black balloon makes her fly.
Dan's reactions to the little girl are so funny
Wow, Limbo is looking great.
Now I really want them to play Night in the Woods or Wand Wars D:
PLAY THE NEVERHOOOD
I'm sorta waiting for Doodle Doods
This is what you get when in possession of the lowest IQ in the known world...
Very bad video. Haha
The man hammers 2pices of wood all the time. Paul got a shot he never uses needles the nail moves to the babies head.
could be fun as a motorcyclist XD
gaining thousands of subs from one video it's elon musk
Look at 0:45 ... Nothing covers the hole when the elevator goes down
Haha they all late. Hitler came up with this idea first.  Berlin would've underground tunnels for pedestrians and cars.
very boring idea
I feel like the new problem would be super long lines to get down unless it's a rapid fire conveyer belt or something. Also, how does it know when you want to stop?
I think Doctor Who already had an episode on this called Gridlock
didn't know you could delete dislikes on a video, but apparently you can.
this is so fucking retarded
there are so many flaws with this idea
I herd u like 10 year old memes, so we put a self-driving car in a self-driving car so you can not-drive while u not-drive...     ... Dawg
Cool concept but sadly wouldn't work in reality. Maybe in a A FEW decades or a century this might be a possibility
Coming soon to a wall near you.
Just another of Musks' new time killers
Then what is the point of roads
What if there is a power outage or a similar power management problem and you become trapped in the middle of a dark 100 mile long tunnel with no cell phone service and your car is trapped on the moving platform?
Wait a minute you are going to dig the earth just for roads?
why use a tunnel? just pretend you're already there and guess what? you're already there
Mom, Dad, All I See is Concrete ... Are We Almost There Yet ?
Wow a *sub*- terranean rail- *way* , who woulda thunk it possible.
With no guard rail or sign that pops up I guarantee someone is gonna drive into that hole in the ground
Japan or Germany but definitely not USA.
I don't get it, it just doesn't deserve any attention, even mention at all.
Amazing ,, but what about Earthquakes
Fanfuckingtastic
This would be cool at first but, it would get BORING after a while....ik we all wanted to make this joke so I made it on your behalf.
So the purpose of this video is...
Another far fetched investment plan by our lord and savior: Elon Musk
No no no no , we have to build a wall first - also , the costs for a tunnel system is very expensive so , this is only a vision at the end of the day
thats boring
They don' wanna see you winninnnnnn
This is so cool!
My only concern is ground water leakage, other than that this concept looks awesome!
They spent 3 years making a fucking sewer line under my neighborhood, how the fuck will they make a car sized tunnel under The Whole of London or LA. Btw my neighborhood is 200 meter long.
I got an i7 and a 980, should be able to run this game fine.
When did our cars get as fat and lazy as us?
#HyperLoop Reinvented
OH because single  railing systems  dont fail ever, not to mention the hazards and suicide rates xD how about a  better public transport instead of cars for everyone?
Fracking alone has given us earthquakes. Imaging now having full underground highway systems? The whole thing will implode
I don't think any of you live in LA, let alone sit in traffic 8 hours a day. For an Angeleno like myself, this is fucking brilliant.
probably will cause major traffic jams, waiting for someone to go up so you can go down in one of those.
You're gonna wake up skullcrawlers
we need that! PLEASE
This will work really well, because Earth is already hollow.
They're boring.
The funny part are the idiots that will drive in on top of the car either going down or coming up. Crunch!
Pretty boring idea...
lol, a subway-drive-in?
So you wanna make transport for your transport? Excellent!
Much more social good would be done by expanding networks of tunnels used for public transit than reserving it for private vehicles.
Why the fuck are people comparing subway to this? There is a hug fucking difference!
it's a nice idea but it just wouldn't work
Good idea but traffic would remain due to the loading and unloading taking so long
And what if an earth quake happens?
Ventilation ? and i mean lots to prevent... tampering with tunnels.. cough. *hint*
.....and another car falls on top of you
how about just use trains?
Not a bad future to live, travelling would be so much easier
Doctor Who anyone?
The tunnels and elevators are ok, but I thought tesla has self driving cars, they would be ideal for such tunnels
wouldn't want to have a malfunction going that fast....
its not a bad idea...I mean imagine you have to travel a long way, but you can't go by train because you ve got baggage or something it's quite nice
if your going to build a tunnel system Elon. then just build the hyperloop instead and save yourself some cash,
May I point out a problem: When the lift is going down, there is a big hole in the street. Perhaps adding an additional enclosure might be advisable.  'welcome. Royalties to me.
And what if it charged the car on the way?
When you need a car for your car...
Luckily there is no earthquake exposure that could trap you in the tunnels in LA.... DOH!
This is so absurd... Public transport is the only affordable solution. This is way too expensive to put in place and to maintain.
Expensive af to make, this will be in the far future because of the cost it would take.
but can it take me to Narnia?
This thing better be made before I die.
wow super..............
Woo hoo ! I am the 17000'th subscriber.

How is this trending with 6 thousand views? YouTube is broken!!!
Its funny no one cared for the Trump family before, but now these savages just constantly attack them for what? how does that help our communities, it doesn't why can't we just accept that Trump is president
The word slave has a definition and it doesn't exclusively refer to african american enslavement. Christians say things like "slave to sin" all the time. Ya'll are so fucking triggered rn.
SOME of the proceeds are going to charity. Get your facts Jed.
So no one on the panel actually read the book?? 🤔🤔 interesting.
Will these Grandmas just go away
LOL GOOD QUESTION "WHY DO WE HAVE TO BRING UP SLAVERY" SAYS THE LIBERAL OMG MY SIDE SHES SO STUPID
That accent of Whoopi's is bloody annoying. Does she think she's amusing?
Why is this trending every single day at 3k views?!?!?!?!?!?!
The hot one is the only one with any sense.
> Video trending at 3.3k views "YouTube doesn't pick videos for trending!"
Whoopi built like spongebob
With that logic Michael Jacksons song "Slave to the rhythm" is offensive.
I need to buy this book!!  The view should be called "gossip girls" ..I guess we should only use quotes from dead people... 
It's always a black woman that would pick the slave topic...talking about slavery so much Whoopi it's like you miss those days!
A lot of women aren't working! The bias on this show is pathetic!
The book is called "Women Who Work" not "Why Women Work"...I don't know anything about it, but those 2 titles have totally different meanings.
LOL at Whoopi. Ivanka has nothing to offer any conversation on anything.
Nobody should buy that dirty book.
Jed Jed Jed really.
so the only time they dont like a democrat woman who believes in everything they do is when they are related to trump?
Ivomitka writing a book. What could she have to say inspiring to women?!
I wonder how Whoopie would feel if a white man impersonated how a black person sounds from the ghetto while trying to make fun of them 🤔
LIKE for Whoopi playing Ivanka on SNL
5:33 It sure ain't easy sitting next to Sara. That isn't the first time I have seen that.
I'D LIKE TO MEET HER FACE TO FACE AND ASK HER HOW SHE THINKS SHE'S THE MOUTH-PIECE FOR ALL WOMEN!
GOOD ONE SUNNY...RAGS TO RICHES NOT RICHES TO RICHER .
The whole family is a parade of degenerates.
Fuck'm all. The entire Family. All the way down to Barron.
Jedidiah is beyond irritating. seriously, she literally paraphrases the others or says nothing when it comes to anything trump related
Feminist against a fellow woman ! Ivanka is more classic and professional compare to all this women   Ok this panel..
Ivanka Trump is a dumb broad that happens to have smart people working around her. Well almost smart people.
This whole family is a joke.
in whoop's voice: I'm a slave to time LOLLLL
Publishing houses, let me introduce your new board of directors.
According to the lawyer, we should abolish inheritance altogether, whenever we passed away our possessions should become a possession of the state. Gifts to our relatives should be restricted to 20 dollars or something.
THINK. Is this Trump daughter (& all from 1st marriage) on "sociopath spectrum"? Don't be afraid to learn about it.                             Read *up to date* sociopath criteria.  1 in 25 is a sociopath (psychopath).
These women like to bully people, double standards.
Tone deaf is right. None of them is in reality sadly to say. is she smart and beautiful...yes but not well rounded in what's really going on.
Blacks are slaves to Democrats, and they love it.
I'm putting out a book on "Child Birth" and how to deal with the pain. Any buyers?
handling huge sums of money is the toughest job in the  world. you wont know that unless you  are wealthy .
These women are just pitiful. Does anyone even watch this show anymore?
I don't understand, none of them read the book yet have an opinion on her.
She's like a smart person.
I don't understand why the Trumps are being allowed to get away with breaking the Law
That money isn't going to charity it's going into her banking account. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree
dwl Everytime I hear Whoopi I just flip out 😂😂😂😂 my day is made
Jed is delusional.
so the word "slave" is off limits? but comparisons of Trump to Hitler or republican as nazis (which is constantly done on this show) is perfectly okay? double standards are the new norm.
Yup going to charity for, straight to her bank account.
it's too soon for a book from her
It's not going to charity
RUDE WHOOPEE. I LOVED U N ALWAYS LOVED U BUT TURNED OFF ON UR PERSONAL ISSUES WITH THE PRESIDENT AND HIA FAMILY
omg the word slave. at times i can be a slave to my time. get off the racial crap
Whoopis ivanka impression
She only got a small loan of a few million dollars.

Trump is easily already the best president the United States has ever seen.  Foreign policy alone has been stellar.
1. Wait till the shit hits the fan 2. troll republicans with "putting idiots in charge is a bad idea, who knew?"
Bill, I love Your Monologue: 100 Days of Trump.
Attributing motive...should be the name of the show....that or Strawman.
Globalism always wins , what are you robots worried about?
Trump has gone to the left and Liberal snowflakes still hate him...
Simple Is Bad! that's the Liberal argument on taxes....
Winning, whining, remember the time when there was a difference?
trumps a dumbass he is incompetent and has no business in the oval office lol I cant believe hes the leader of the USA GO BILL MAHER TELL IT LIKE IT IS!! YOU THE MAN!!
Oh yeah! You go Bill Maher! You are so fucking funny.
The greatest as usual, congratulations from Latin America and France, there is still some hope for you , REVOLUTION
if you support Trump your a Coward simpleton traitor.
You can complain about Trump all you want... The dems couldn't put forward a better candidate...
research this hack he speaks who pays
Duh, this stooge licks the boots that pay him , trust me he doesn't care about the view just the payments
I'm a trump supporter but damn I cry every time Bill says "nobody knew" with the Russian accent hahaha
Satire is a fascist killer.....Buh Bye.
Anonymous... let's see that Tax Return and the Pissy Mattress Video, thanks
I'm not American and the Trump supporters I've ever spoken to really are the most deluded arrogant vile cretins
No respect for the 45 as he is a whining little bitch!!! :D  and the world is laughing AT him everyday!!
its not mental illness, is uneducated. Being a dumbass for decades
Bernie Sanders should of been president... he was the safe bet.. now look what we got ourselves into
What were you all thinking, who voted for that racist orange pumpkin? Now deal with it. For being bad minded and wanted to erase everything President Obama did for this country.
FAKE NEWS, raging liberal idiot. Tired of his retarded liberal views.
I love seeing the democrats whine hahahahaha demonic nut jobs....hah
FYI Bill M is antiChrist
Bill Clinton always said "It's the economy stupid.". Seems like Hillary forgot.
Trump is Chance the gardener.
another @ss
Bravo!  Funny!  :)
If you watch this without sound and CC on - it is gibberish... please provide access to your material accurately... CAPTION and - if you use the "auto generated" captioning, verify its quality (you will find it isnt)
Billdo is such a sell out im so disappointed. Bill for fucks sake  man you are only honest about islam.
So proud to be Canadian
I mean he hasnt accomplished anything, isnt that a good thing if youre a democrat?
I give Agent Orange a fuck -.  He knows nothing, is nothing, and always be nothing.
I heard Trump hasn't even changed his cell phone number and his home phone has the same answering machine that says,..."LEAVE A MESSAGE,...OR,...  YOUR FIRED!!" 😂😂😂   TRUE STORY.
I may only be as smart as an eight year old , but I knew he was a DE DE DE when I found out he didn't even have a DOG!!!!
as a trump voter this was really funny, one of my favorite comedians!!!
I am proud of Bill. He went from making soft core porn movies in the 80's to having his own show and being a dick liberal.
whiny little bitch... lol!!!
Just not funny anymore.
This is all so scary and sad
whats crazy is mfs think this is an attack on president bozo but it's actual facts smh... see y'all in hell
I love Trumptards! It is so much fun giving them a loaded weapon and watching them shot themselves... Now, give them a president and then you've got all the fun you can possibly get...
I refuse to denigrate those  who voted for Donald Trump.  For those who voted for Donald Trump the word 'denigrate' means 'to put down'.
Hillary said today at a conference in NYC, where I live, that it was the Russians fault why she lost..Hey, I'm Russian and trust me, it wasn't her..
Oh wait, I forgot, it wasn't just the dial up comment on the poor folk in Pennsylvania, it was the Russians..Hahahah..Hey, Maher, can you get yet why your girl lost..
toxic trump always blowing his own trumpet
Bill Maher lost weight, but using the same old suits.
In his first 100 DAYS, Trump has LIED 452 TIMES
Thank goodness for the laughs because most of the time seeing what the Trump-dump is doing and saying is making us ill.
Cheesy Bill Maher
how did anyone give this BIll Maher a tv show ? this guy just oozes I'm a slime bag, like I would find it hard not to punch his face in. God i wish i can remove my view to this video
Wow!  look at the ratio of thumbs up to thumbs down on this video!  Amazing!  approx 11,000 to 600!  Who's winning now?
Imagine Maher needs to expend 1500 bucks to get easy and masturbate!! What looser!!
Just another opinionated POS
I'm no trump fan. however, starting to get the feeling these left wing liberals only care about bashing trump and not about our country.... starting to lean the other way. and bill maher has always been a idiot
{yawn}  BORRR-INGGGG!!!  Where's JAY LENO when u need him.
oooohhh oooohhh Russia
Orange is the new Snowflake..
BRILLIANT.  The baby playing with the mobile killed me.
I love Trump and I still can't help but laugh at all this.
LITTLE WHINY BITCH LEFT HAND  MAHER.Lack of due respect to POTUS.
he needs a tailor. his suit looks too big. cheap and sloppy. yikes
Idiot Lefing on Idiot Jocks  an IDIOT presenting
Bill Maher wouldn't amount to a pimple on Donald Trump's ass..
"Women and space exploration"? Yeah, Trump claimed he knew about exploring women's spaces. To boldly go where no tiny hands have gone before.
a hundred days.. does it mean the worse part is over?
this zionist shill is funny :)
i like the scott adams view on this. everyone agree that the 100 days is not important but let's act as if it was.
"It looks so easy when Morgan Freeman does it!!!"   LOL!!!!
This was... funny? Billy O'cuntface did to comedy what AIDS did to niggers and queers
If Hillary had won, you'd be in the middle of WWIII right now, so consider yourselves lucky.
So finally bill maher admits trump is doing the same thing obama did! Nothing is gonna change.  Maybe a little worst a little better but corruption just like obama.   Both parties are bought!
love you Bill I believe you hate the "t"rump as much as I do . Please keep up the satire we all love it     great ratings   good   hahahaha
Mobile wheel, dead joke. Kill it.
Oh Maher!! You so bad!!
Obama was not a good president.  Obama is a puppet of the super rich.
Its so odd, this TV presenter is clearly stupid, laughing at his own unintelligent sarcasm. If an idiot like this can be on TV then the USA really is in trouble.
some need to do a "I survived the first 100th's " t shirt or red hat... ; )

And after the race the American girl said"I really need to get my hands on some of dem dumplings,far deese burgers ain't doin it fi mi".
black ,green and gold.....up up up mi seh😉😉😉😉
of course you guys lost the mens 4x1, the womens sprint medley and we were not brutalized......Jamaica please have several seats and go back to your rightful place being good for nothing other than food and weed
This was a USA b team at best. Talk to me in London!!
Jamaican ran 4 seconds slower than the Americans did last week at World Relays but congrats though👌🏾😂
I just can't stop watching this
why was Hastings the only Elite there, wth.
Hastings with that Jamaican and Trinidadian BIG BATTY
and only 13 seconds off the world record  lol   too bad america had their b team in there except for hastings
Can someone please post the 4x100 in the Penn relay.
Our anchor looks like she could run another 400 - she did not even look tired.  Go girls - we love you all so much - proud.
The last runner well make the Jamaican 400team others well be a question mark
We need a sub 10.9 VCB, and Christania to assault the World record in London
Jamaica, yes please
those American commentators smh
Shericka "action" Jackson  seems to patent her running  style like Allison Felix,they both separate themselves from the field in the 4x4 relays.
Where are Courtney Okolo and Quanera Hayes?
Do the same stunt at Worlds USA. You're going to need 4 Allyson Felixes to take the title from JA
DWL!!! "Ah aah, I doh think soooo"  Ded. COmmentator outta orda bad.
Am I seeing correctly or did the US chick hit the baton out of Nigeria's hand accidentally? Smh
Natasha u are not Felix. Only Felix can chase the Jamaicans down. Tasha always go so hard and have nothing in her tank 4 the last 100m. Both teams have done well.
What happened to the Bahamian team? They were going to place 3rd suh what the he'll happened ? Anyways TEAM JAMAICA
Love that "I don't think so!" ROFL!!!

When it says $1,750 in the title but $1,700 in the vid and title🙄
I love my cats even if they're not dogs. Every penny was worth i- no wait we got them free...
i have a shorkie its 2k
Stupid to pay that for a freaking mutt.  AKA isn't a legit registry. Stay away from pet stores. Poor things come from Puppy Mills 
Be happy no matter what kind if dog you have ☺
people should own dog
So... take it to court
DNA doesn't lie. I would sue the Breeder and the pet shop.
I have a shorkie and idc if it is one or not lmao.   We got her for free They really wanted to get rid of them
white ppl problems lol😂😂😂
I love bread too
Maybe next time adopt instead of shop?!
I don't care about their DNA or what kind of breeds they are..I will love them no matter what.
Spends thousands on designer breeds, not smart enough to use Google to see what the breed should look like.
you don't want the dog? then give it to me then.
you don't want the dog? then give it to me then.
mm how about u give it to me if ya hate it so much
I love my dog, she's a labradoodle, or a mutt as others would say, but I don't care at all I love her no matter what
when people want a Pure breed they should buy a dog with pedigree. if they dont care then just support a shelter, therr is tons of young dogs and even puppies...
wow. It's a shame that some people just buy (not adopt) dogs because they think they're some kind of trophy to show-off. 😐
Who cares if it's a pure bread or not, if it's a dog it's amazing. Don't get mad about what dog it is, be happy you have a very kind being to be in your life and keep you happy. 😀
Wait but there's not actually a real thing as breeds. If they wanted their dog to look like its parents then it would have been inbred. This whole thing is ridiculous.
OMG she is so rude I would not care I would love to have a dog I think it was so cute
I hate they keep calling the dogs mutts
my dog is a mut, shes part boxer ,border collie, and pit but looks more like a boxer
I wouldn't care what breed my dog is I would just care if he liked me
I have a pug and am 100% sure he's purebred, no way to fake a pug
We paid $600 for our Shorkie and everyone always roasts him
I'd sue for my money back but at the same time, i would NEVER get rid of it just because of it's breed
I don't care what kind of breed my dog is I love him with all my heart
Why do peolpe use a mutt as a insulate there so cute!!!
"You've seen the commercials" I have never seen one of those in my life ever
Please, please, please adopt and not shop
Why am I watching this
I'm sorry, but a hybrid dog is STILL a lovable cute mutt. A mutt is a mutt and you should love all dogs you get. BUT SERIOUSLY, she's upset her mixed dog was a mixed dog. That was weird to me.
White people.
Serves these breed fanatics right. They really frustrate me with their obsession with looks. I mean I get it, some breeds do look adorable but they usually also come with health issues
had to throw out a couple dogs this week cause they weren't purebred.   thank Allah for DNA test or else innocent owners would be forced to raise these fake animals
I spent 1,500€ on my little pug but it was worth every penny and I wouldn't give him for the world
I paid 25 for my little mut at our shelter and I love love love her
It is her own dumb fault for buying a dog.
What if I breed a chihuahua with a husky?
maltese,havanese,japanese,cancer,black people,white people,asian,osama,9/11is expensive,fakers         Give me all your hate 
She could have just gone to a shelter and adopted a dog. Cheaper and more ethical!
so *Mutt* means mixed breed?
ok... i don't like the tone in their voice when they say "mutt". Lets make that a hate word. "oh its just a MUTT". Puppy haters!
I would take a bullet for my doggo ❤❤❤
I wouldn't give a damn about the breed of any dog I get. I'd just love him with all my heart.
When I paused at 0:49 I realized that looked like my dog 😂
I can't go in a dog shop and pick out one
This is why you adopt from a shelter.
awww. look at them puppies.
the fact that people only like their dog for their breed disgusts me.
Here's a question: who cares what breed? They're so cute!
Guys the dog is still just as nice as it was before you knew
Who cares?!?! It's still freaking adorable
My dog is a chihuahua, at least that's all we know, and we might get a friend for her because we might be fostering a dog!!
PFFFT WHO CARES ABOUT THE DOCUMENT HIS DNA SAYS HES A MUTT!  I don't like like saying mutt because it sound mean, so I'll just say mix HE IS A MIX nothing is perfect, there's gonna be a different breed somewhere
Ridiculous.  A dog deserves love no matter what the breed!
The best breed is the homeless mutt from your local shelter
I don't like the way he says mutt like shaming ALL the Lil cuties :(...
I love my dog no matter what breed! I LOVE HER FOREVER!
why would you care??
I don't get people's logic with animals, you can't even give away cats for free, but people will spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on a dog, why?
Here's a solution: Buy a rescue dog.
Good... I hope people who spend that much on breeder dogs get screwed over as often as possible.  Adopt.
Who tf cares just buy the dog because you like it
I took a DNA and I wasnt the dad
I don't care what my dogs breed is... I love my lil' pup!
My dog is mixed with annoying and annoying. But I love him.
I got my dog for 50$ and no matter her price or breed she is my baby and I love her.
well, she did pay for the dog and expected the dog to be a certain breed. it's not like she's gonna give it up because she doesn't love it anymore. god damn
rude! I love my dog no matter what! it dosent matter what breed or what it looks like as long i get to know it. And jeez, we only bought our Shiztu-Yorkie for $700. And, HE'S A GREAT DOG! ☺
My dog is a shorkie.... O gawd
my dog is part shitzu and jalf maltese
You should be grateful of what you have...I don't really care what breed it is...I still love them no matter what.❤️🐶
What's so bad about mutts? Pure Breds all look the same when mutts come in different appearances and fur patterns. Smh
My full white with a black eye jack Russell was free xD
The reporter reminds me of Amanda Cerny
What on earth stupidly makes this news reporter wear such provactive top to read news????    Oh! I know the answer now....  Coz she has a "blonde" hair!!!! 😃😃😃
ha ha ha..... good....    that's what you get for buying mutts at pet stores and puppy mills.
you paid almost 2g's for a mutt
lmao all dogs matter!!
This Is why you do research on breeders that you get your dog from or this happens
pure bread 😂😂😂😂😂
That what you get for supporting puppy mills. You deserve it. You could've adopted a similar dog at the shelter.
thats a rat
Magic Kingdom is not 108ft above ground level, it is 108ft above sea level.  *Big* difference.
This video is EXCELLENT!! Awesome production value, motion animation nice flow quality narration.... VERY IMPRESSED! Keep up the good work!
I saw the miniatures for this ride on display at Walt Disney World in 1979.
This is definitely the biggest let down that this area never got built (as far as an attraction goes) such a missed opportunity
Great video your channel is really good could you check out my videos and maybe subscribe
Amazing video! Love your theme tune and running song, please make a vid about Kongfrontation
I'm surprised that these concepts didn't re-appear in the plans for Disney America. I'm still pretty salty about that getting canned. New video idea maybe?
ahhh i love all ur videos. I get so excited every time i see u've uploaded something new!
Love this channel. one of my favourites. love the unknown history you dig up on theme parks and rides. any more universal ones coming soon? lets be honest its the best theme park ;P
I want beastly kingdom's dragon tower to be built
Can you make a video about Expedition Everest? Love your content!
Your videos have way to much production value for only having 33K. Hell I've seen 5 million sub channels have less production value then this. Bravo
Cool. While I'm sure this was in the pipeline already, I suggested this a few videos back. Awesome work.
Nice intro!!
Keep 'em coming, my friend. So much great lore here.
Sounds like Delos and Westworld!
I just love your intro video! It makes so much hype before a video is about to start!
Beastly Kingdom instead of Pandora!!
Love your videos!
I'd go with Beastly Kingdom. I'm sorry, but that Dragon Coaster just seems kick ass!
Personally, I'm glad they chose POTC instead of the western ride. BTM and Splash Mountain are enough.
I believe this will be included as part of the 50th anniversary. That is if those Frontierland expansion rumors are to be believed....
These videos are amazing. I've gone through and watched all of them on your channel and I'm in love with the series. Great work!
Oh goodness I've been loving your channel.  It's absolutely astounding, and I implore you to keep doing these videos.
Isn't thunder mesa the name of the town in Disneyland Paris that connects phantom manor and big thunder? maybe just an easter egg or homage
i had no idea about this. I'm loving your videos. Keep up the great job.
I want to live in the alternate timeline where Beastly Kingdom became a reality
Love these videos! Please do more about unbuilt/planned disney park ideas! Keep up the great work :)
Keep making great content man! I love learning this stuff about disney!
that land and attraction would have been amazing
I love this channel! I only wish you would make more videos and more often. Do you have a Patreon account? You should so that people can donate and help you make more videos. Keep up the good work.
I love this channel!
HOW do you not have more followers??
Could you do a video on extraterrorestrial alien encounter I want to know your perspective on the attraction
Love these videos! I know they must be really time consuming to produce, but they're fantastic! Keep up the great content!
I enjoy your videos very much. Well researched and informative.
2:23 so it would've been "what if Disney made Westworld"
After a few videos this is now becoming my favourite YouTube channel, loving the research you do and finding all of this classic footage!
This ride sounds like it would've been quite dull
Can your next theme park video be a Universal Studios one? You only have one and that's jaws.
all these projects that never seen the light, like this and WESTCOT and Beastly Kingdom look SO COOL. Ughh
Soooo Disney World almost had Westworld. That's what I'm getting from this video.
idk why stuff like this interest me but i looove this channel!
I would've liked to see this Attraction come to life. I bet it would be amazing!
I would want this ride due to it being based in Utah were i live
Great content, script and voiceover. Keep on with good work!!!
how can you make a video about thunder mesa/dry gulch without even MENTIONING disneyland paris' frontierland?? it is literally the entire backstory and plot of the french thunder mountain and haunted mansion
This would be worth a petition to Disney.   What an incredibly cool concept.
I would have love to see Mt. Fuji Roller Coaster and the Soviet Union Pavillion in Epcot and Would Still Love to see Disney's America be created somewhere in the United States
I'm so glad your videos are becoming more and more popular! Keep it up! I love watching them!
"Greetings!"Event though it is a difficult decision, I would wish for Beastly Kingdom to have come to fruitation. ~Ice~
River Country? Or how about the unbuilt Atlantis expedition replacement for the submarines at Disneyland?
Quality content! Keep up the good work.
Wait, so the DisWorld Thunder came before DisLand Thunder?
Your channel is so good I love the history of theme parks especially the ones that were never built
I would like to have seen the steampunk-themed Discovery Bay at Disneyland, or the Roger Rabbit-themed land at Disney-MGM (Roger Rabbit's Hollywood/Maroon Studios).
Great job as always
Great video, keep up the good work!
Can you plz do pleasure island from the 60s
Great Video As Always!!!!!!!
can you do one of the old Kong ride?
I love your vids man and i know google ads are paying shit but please for for your eager viewers could you post more.
A lot of the elements for this project went to Disneyland Paris' Phantom Manor, which also involved Tony Baxter I believe.
Though I love Pirates of the Carribean and would never replace it, I would have loved to see this ride as well, not instead, but as well.
I just discovered your channel and you are my favorite youtuber
YES!! I love these vids so much~ your readings are soothing.
He must have been confused about the best Kanye album question... it's obviously:  1. Late Registration and College Dropout 2. Graduation 3. Watch the Throne 4. Everything else

Tanya was her real name?... LOL! #ModernRomance
Would he ask ' where you really from' to a black person? No. 🤔
Great interview. Why 73 though?
About 3 Kim's (What!). Lol
Aziz had no idea he's Vogue material.  He's very flattered!!!
He's like a cartoon. He always uses bizarre facial expressions. Kinda like he's forcing himself to feel emotions.
My kids 😂😂😂😂 bahahahah! Love him.
Is he a refugee?
What a guy.
good bye little Sebastian 😢
5:36 He sounds constipated.
reminds me of joe pesci
Aziz is Asian himself so good that he's giving advice to Asians lol
He's so good at talking
Best question should have been wtf was that concoction of yuck he was making
where is 808 and heartbreak in his list?
Scripted, but funny.
I get a slight "casting couch" feel from this video lolol
I like this guy
"best gift? my kids. wait, you have kids? No." That seemed too scripted. Then while I was writing this that guy walked in and the interviewer didn't react and I realised it was all scripted lol
Everyone has their opinion but when ranking Kanye's album, he was wrong.
I didn't know someone's kanye rankings could be so bad.

Wait what? Chris pratt?
He's great but this is so set up and contrived
I swear ur that nerd from diary of a wimpy kid
73 questions for Priyanka Chopra i 😘 pc
"You keep quiet."  He must be a Liberal.
GOD DAMN IT AMERICA!
Its all scripted.
Stroller in airplane 😳😳😳😳and she like a child cry for stroller ? 😳😳😳
The Apes are at it again
the customer knows that she CANNOT bring a stroller into the passenger cabin.  She could have checked it for free at the ticket counter or at the gate.  She is a moron
How long did it take to go from pretty stewardesses serving gourmet dinners to this?
American airliners have been acting like an authority figure since 911
A REAL badguy would have just kicked her off the plane... Id say what that gentleman did was quite reasonable. You bring something thats fucking banned with you, you get punished 'with' that.
😱😱😱 what's this !!!! stop to use this bad company let them value their costumers
Did they patch this money glitch yet?
"Come fly the friendly skies"  Come on, hit me!!!!
I am really disgusted by the mother.what even
I am really disgusted by the mother.what even
weeeeeell, this is so funny, it's so obvious that she's faking it, goddamn piece of crap, she acts like she was cut her legs off...what could be so painful about hitting you with 5kg stroller...? Goddamn people.....
why is it.okay to hit a man but a woman?
why the hell do you overbook?
Nothing like a white knight nowadays....
this is why we don't choose white people airlines
Those are tears of joy, she and the baby was not beaten to death then kicked off the plane.
another trash airline
I love you and I miss you haaaaaaaaa
Damn women stfu did he hit her she acting like baby smh
This is American style!   U got some problems? Huh?! Mother fuxxer! Come on man! U wanna bounce me? Huh?! BANG! BANG BANG!!!
Next time: United and American Airlines team up to take on Delta
How have you not learned from United? American Airlines, the company, did at least.
Seems like there's more to this story. Seems like there's more to this crying person as well. Person who recorded should have stated the context of what happened prior to recording.
To bad there wasn't any real men on that plane to beat that assholes ass!
dumbass whites
he looks like mickey rooney. the little man with the big mouth
#airpassangerlivesmatter
This lady needs to get control over her emotions carrying this child crying like a teenager is not a good example either
This is super ironic... airlines are always trying to scam us and now we're all gonna try to scam them. Lmfao
American Airlines, welcome to your tape...
*inspired by united airlines*
"You don't know what the story is." Now, why would he say that? Because the passenger, who came to her defense, didn't read the storyline for the scene. This is fake.
I have known you can't take a stroller on a plane ? have things changed ?
Did you see how scared he got when he saw how big the other man is?
anyone else thought that was ted cruz when he stood up?
FAKE. Divide and conquer the minions.
The womans cry is so fake, why do we need more fake shit on youtube
Woman crying, What's New?????????????
what are the odd that short bald guy is a homo and his balloon knot was sore from the night before. the way the little fella was waving is finger was odd to the little bitch.
The face she's making looks like 😂 instead of 😭.
looks fake to me, like the crying is totally dramatized/fake. United wasn't a joke, produce the video of him doing something or its fake.
I didn't see anyone get hit, just some crying and arguing.
sue her, tbh
she did that on purpose she knows t h at no strollers are allowed in plane.she just wants to sue
What is up with all these employees lately?!
Guy at 0:46 ain't too smart threatening flight crew.... Federal offense.... Just saying
guy should have ripped the skin right off his bald head
God Damn Americans make me sick...  & I'm American...    Kudos to the bald guy that's obligated to be there for a paycheck so that he can feed his family though.
Sit down dude. It's not about you.
He should have knocked him out.... What a puss
wish i couldve seen that whiney bitch get hit. he couldve atleast shook the baby
As Americans, we put up with too much sh*t. We need to band together and be a stronger Nation regardless of race or creed, ALL Americans.
Nothing to see here what's the big deal.  It's a miracle that hundreds of people cram into jets like sardines every day and their's not more of these kinds of incidents.
United Airlines and American Airlines have announced that they join, and beat up random people on their planes...
first united, now this? we need to just boat our way everywhere
OK that passanger at the end was too extra
And the Oscar goes to.....the woman with the fake cry sound!
0:49 never respond to a retard customer like that -_- man has no idea what is going on, you dont need to try to tell him 'he doesnt know the story' its none of his business. leave your display of manhood outside 'bud'
Someone please kill the vanilla milk dud
NEVER flying American Airlines.  I dont care what the story is!
they should have removed her from the plane to practice her theatrics

Hamish singing his heart out is so cute!
you look so nervous, it's so cute
I wanna see some one knock out that dirty Russian .
cap should be alimanted not becues I love the pens sids ingere
It's time to bring up tom sestito to knock some since into the caps xD
Russian fans ,for Washington,and all because those are our favorites. Ovechkin,Kuznetsov and Orlov..the Stanley Cup to Washington..
NHL stop giving the ending away
Shame on those who left early. Never give up on your team.
At 0:33 ovie hits crosby in the head
He put his arms into crosbys face that was intentional plus its niskenan
I'm a Caps fan with mad respect for Sidney Crosby but any hockey fan knows that the best of all time is The Great One Wayne Gretzky!!!
Way to go Caps let's even this series and get home ice back. No one wants to see injuries happen that was such a bang bang type play.
damn look at all of those seats empty behind the benches thats sad great seats wasted!!!
Pens still got this
Kinda odd how both teams have won only on the away ice..
No intent to hurt Cindy.  Hope she is okay.  That's no way to treat a lady.
It's about time Capitals... Make this a series
If Ovechkin took the same hit Crosby got he would be back out within 10 minutes
Ovi will knock your best player out again until he can't walk no more. Go CAPS!!!! BEST THEM WHINER PENS. THERE IS NO CRYING IN HOCKEY.
There was intent to cross check.  It was just the fact that Crosby went down that was the accident.
fluke, the Caps fans know what it is.... These Boys aren't ready for the cup! They blow a 2 goal lead with an empty net lololol... Pens in 5 or 6 max
At 3:40, in OT, I understand the defender doing all he can to stop the goal, but I will never understand sending a guy flying into your own goalie like that.  I feel like I've seen it happen so much this season.
Niskanen should have said "I’ve gotten those before. They don’t feel good.”
Go pens in game four
I am impressed how the Penguins can still play quite well to tie it late in the 3rd even without Crosby. Hope Crosby is okay.
Sydney Crosby = Lebron James
That was a great game for Washington capitals 😃🇺🇸
A lot of you haters seem to want Crosby dead, geez.
I hope Crosby recovers to his full health and has to shake Ovechkin’s hand and wish him luck in the next round of the playoffs.
Happy Crosbys hurt. Let's go Caps. We have a chance.
The penguins have the most hateful fans. There was dirty play on both sides. Niskys hit was obviously not intentional. He just got hurt unfortunately
Ovechkin hit him in the head definitely intensional but the cross check could have been either way
I wanna be optimistic but after a hit like that...Sids done for the season. i still believe we can win this series but its gonna be tough
They got so insanely lucky this entire game. They destroyed Crosby, ended Sheary, got an insanely lucky bounce for their first goal, and the penguins just couldn't catch a break at their goal. Half their shots went wide
Hate has a remarkable ability to make people irrational and unreasonable, as is evidenced by the ridiculous comments on this page.... It's not even worth arguing with them.
Caps fan here, hope Crosby is okay. Would prefer to beat them when they're at their best. On that note, please win game 4 boys and come back home on Saturday 2-2
Pittsburgh scored twice for nothing
Feel bad for Cindy .
Missed the caps defenceman's incredible stop on the goal line that should have been a goal on Pens powerplay in the first.  And dear NHL: please stop spoiling what happens in the title. Thank you.
They did nothing to the guy that hit Crosby !!!!!
This sucks. Crosby is such a young dude and he's been fucked so many times. Obviously this injury was not intentional, but still sucks. Hope he returns. I highly doubt caps will comeback from this. (Cap fan)
Dirty Rags and dirty Caps! two scumbags who injure the best player of their opposition.
From a caps fan: I hope Crosby's okay. That was a bad hit.
Why ref said "After video replay we have a good goal" and then changed his decision?
Crosby is definitely the NHL equivalent of Tom Brady. I'm a caps fan, but to wish ill on a player is shameful
was intentional for sure. he didnt violently do it but sneakingly put the stick to the head ..plain as day ..
Where were you pens fans before Crosby? Bandwagon much!See, i can act like a butthurt loser too!
Why is so many empty seats in arena???
Why is so many empty seats in arena???
My heart sank when I saw the hit to the head. Anything but the head! I hope he comes back. He's been doing so well.
Hope Crosby is alright and gets back soon so I can resume booing him
Oh boy the comments
Fuckin hate it when players celebrate when the puck isn't even in the net lol like keep playing scrubs
I hope Crosby is okay he's the heart and soul of the Penguins
If you shoot the puck and it goes in the other teams net then that is a goal.
another road team win.
What's with all these away wins?
if the caps win on the road, they can win again... good luck to each team..
2:16 - Great save
They probably would have been swept if they hadn't injured Crosby. It seemed like Penguins had the Capitals number when Crosby was leading the team.
hoping for caps comeback
How do you choke a 2 goal lead in under a minute?...
what a game! last 2 mins was great!
Even if you don't like the guy, I hope he's okay
What a save from Fleury. The playoffs have had quite a few heart stoppers so far and more to come
Pens in 5 or 6. Crosby will be back with a purpose and we all know it. Just a matter of time. Caps almost choked again. Pens got game 4.
Easily one of the best playoff games I've seen in awhile, God I hope we get seven games
That was a filthy save by fleury I'm excited to see if my Rangers can play Pittsburgh again!😂
idk how people can be happy seeing someone get injured. especially the best player in the league. it's absurd.
Holtby woke up
I still don't get how a good goal on the ice can be reviewed and called a good goal, then be reviewed again and be no goal...like what magically changed in 30 seconds?
Hopefully career ending, head should've came all the way off
Niskanen's going to get banned from the NHL and life without parole because of they Crosby hit.
That hit on crosby was accidental. Nothing intentional.
The sound of Crosbys neck crack is delicious.
I edited because of a mistake
Annnnnnd YouTube is gone retarded again...
Twin Peaks has been the only scary movie in my life. Genial David Lynch knows everything about fear.
wow this is awesome very sad for what happened to Laura Palmer her dad was the Beast
Pointless, meaningless and boring as fuck!! Disgusting movie ever!!
When you started season 2 and you accidentally find out who killed laura😔
i seen this movie once as a kid n didnt get 2 c it all but when i got older i rented it, watched it twice n still am kinda sumwhat confussed. wtf was going on????
WHO THE HELL DISLIKED THIS VIDEO? SHAME ON YOU
So underrated tbh. It unfortunately didn't quite have the same bizarre, soapy atmosphere that the TV show had, but it works damn well as a tragic horror movie. Sheryl Lee is brilliant.
incredible trailer wow
that guy who liked Pie.
Love the show but this movie is something else.  Lynch killed it.
anyone know the song please
I love the music in this film
danielle colby brought me here might also watch razorback r.i.p bowie
this is literally the best ever!!!!!!!
Shameful that ignorant critics bashed this to hell upon release. This prequel movie is a masterpiece :-)
Holy crap I nearly soiled myself!
still creepy til this day! amazing show, good movie!
Did this come out after twin peaks or was it supposed to be watched before it all kicked off?
Weird movie!
I can't imagine anyone else directing a movie with a trailer like this.
YEAYYYY...... this video hit 1.2 million views😃 CONGRATULATIONS🎉
best youtuber Ever
Nice vid captain obvious

magmamusen? where are you?! when i click into your channel it doesnt appear!!!

Good idea! :DDD
I just watch most of them
They can just kill it to get inside...
I very like your video
Hi Captain obivious !!
you are the best  all off the guys 😀
I have an idea!!What if you put lever 2 block far from the door to control that door??
are you 7 year old?
how can you close it. when your inside?
How do you close the door when your in because if it is a big house than you could be in a different room and sleeping and someone could come in
LOVE YA MR OBCIOUS XD
Thats a really good idea!
what if we want to sleep when the door closed ? we cant get in without breaking blocks.
It looks nice but how are you going to sleep when the door is opened
hey magmamusen i see your videos  they are usefull because i also play minecraft but what i want is that why dont you put all your ideas in one big house. you should try creative mode. its really fun
if u want to sleep how to close the door
But they can kill you dog  😶
--and now, another successful fail for me. *lol*
wow mag.your building skills and brain is the world best.you can go to be a teacher on minecraft <3
at 2 million subs i want upgrade the island
What if a player or entity kills the dog?
But  they can kill your dog
5:47 well theres a way tomget in the house and to push the house they just break it but its nice
You can break block
You can vind in ik you break de block
dint think this through
ps how to sleep inside when dog secured the house
Why do you upload videos so long? it is like 2 weeks per video 😨😞😞😞
Great idea! ill totally use it!
You can open the chest by trapdoor
hey MagmaMusen can you do a face reaveal 1Millions subs like if you agree
3:10 Best quote from MagmaMuseum so far
make a how to make starter house
When I read the tittle it struck me as "how to make a working dog" bc dogs aren't working enough XD heheheh I luv this tbh tho :0
Handy and Stylish. Love your idea!!! #250likesforhim
Can you attack the dog? Somebody killed my dog when I did this.
Where is Kebab??? D:
How to make a dressing room😍😍
screw face reveal, please reveal the seed of your island!!
Please do a mine like wear you find diamonds and gold
Dude. You helped me out with a lot of my Minecraft maps I made. Thanks a lot dude. Keep this series up! 👍 👍 👍
the worst idea ever...
what if they kill the dog
Maybe the system would work better if you added a lead to control the dog better and a fence to attach the lead to in the house.
and what if they will kill the dog and the door will open?
if I will make Walls. What if they will use stone pickaxe or above and broke the iron door
that was some awesome video keep up the good work
lol that's not even that hard. Do you even know what  command block is? Haha
That's really cool
People can also kill the dog to get in too,
I like it butt how do you close the door whileyour inside
#StopTheCopy   #NO #COPY
I dealt the best home
Why r u never in creative plz be in at least ONE of your vids

may the fourth be with you all
May the fourth be with you! I'm excited for this
is that Yoda o the rock when Rey is trying with the light saber
Star Wars 8 the last Jedi looks good
Who is watching this today May 4th !!!!
may the force be with you this day .
may the 4th be with you
im so watching that!!!!!!
WHY SHOULD THE JEDI END WHY LUKE TELL US!!!
May the fourth be with you
Books? Books?! Star Wars doesn't have books or paper. It's a rule of the Star Wars universe.
May the 4th Be With You!!!
Happy May the Fourth. everyone who's watching this on Star Wars day
and people say rouge one is better then force awakens not neccessarily 100%  true....
Whos watching this because its May the 4th
Cams back here to say that I really want Vader to come out of now where and Solo to be a force ghost come on he deserves it! He is a jedi I don't care what you say, to me he is!!!    (John Williams is a real Jedi)
May the fourth be with you
May the 4th be with us.
Can't believe this movie has been out for 35 years now.
its rated sa for super awesonme
at 1:30 it is yoda.
May the 4th be with you!  :><:
MAY THE 4TH BE WITH YOU ALL!!
Is it only me but I swear the person saying the Jedi must end is Kylo not Luke... makes more sense if it was Kylo...
MAY THE 4TH BE WITH YOU!
Cant wait for this! Roll on december!
I liked but the 8 is the 9 and the 9 is the 8 movie
They should have published it today, because then there would be 10 thousand comments saying, 'May the 4th be with you'
I am so happy Mark has his voice sounding like Luke Skywalker.
May the 4th be with you.
#MayTheFourthBeWithYou
Watching the trailer again on #StarWarsDay May the fourth be with us.
May the 4th be with you!
0:46: Leia's Help me Obi-Wan sound, 0:51 Darth Vader breathe and Obi-Wan's (Ben Kenobi's) secuced by the darkside voice, 0:59 Yoda's surround us, bind us voice omg i can't believe it!
May the Fourth be with everyone!
Omg background voices Obi-Wan,Leia,Yoda's sound omg this movie will be so much bigger
Today was the first time I saw this trailer. Picked an honorary day to watch it. Happy Star Wars Day everyone. May the Fourth be with you.
Directed by Micheal bay
May the 4th be with you #StarWarsDay
Finally I think Disney pulled a con on the trailer as I think Vonn says the line "Its time for the Jedi to end" not Luke. If you listen closely it sounds more like Benito del Toro than Mark Hamill.
Will always love Star Wars but unfortunately the series has been feminized-dull, boring but beautiful to watch!
May the fourth be with you, everyone.
May the 4th Be With You.
I SWEAR IF ANYONE HURTS POE I WILL PERSONALLY CHOP OFF THEIR HANDS
May the 4th be with you, everyone!
May the 4th be with you.
The SJW is strong with this one
I believe that Rey is Obi - Wan's Uncle.  Deal with it.
Wow how did you see kylo again! he died! The star killer base got destroyed! And he exploded!
MAY THE 4TH BE WITH YOU
If poe's X-Wing Black One is destroyed in this movie I will be grabbing my stuff and walking out of the cinema
Why does the jedi order need to end
May the 4th be with you
This one looks better than the last one, which I didn't like very much.
Right now I'm more hyped to hear the music
0:59 ...And Yoda says something here but I can't understand what
Looks like an attack of the clones rip off D:<
Jar-Jar Binks is the last Jedi.
im going to tell myself that poe was running to finn
May the 4th be with you!
Christmas hype boyos!!
at 1:11 in the movie it looks like yoda in on the rocks on the ledge
The level of midi-chlorians is high in this one.
Finally Luke sees through lies of the jedi like his father before him.
Happy Star wars day! And *may the force be with you!*
VII and now VIII sicken me. What a horrific waste of so much story telling that could have been told.
if this the last star wars😱
Star Wars is even more epic when it is made by fans instead of its creators.
May the 4th be with you!
happy star wars day everyone ! may the fourth be with you
#Maythe4thbewithYou everyone!
Disney deserves to be castrated for what it's done
May the fourth be with you
I've watched this over 100th time. Let me know if you already pass my record.
May the fourth be with you
Luke is secretly training Rey the ways of the dark side until Rey realizes and becomes the last Jedi. 😱
May the 4th be with you, guys
"I'm right and everyone is wrong" Basically your opinion...
The arguments in the comments are cringe with this one
Is that the Bendu?
im surprised it isnt called "the first order strikes back"
Where's the George Lucas Special Edition trailer?

Yo who got dat beef donut?
I am not socialpath but sometimes I do get mad and  there are times I laugh
I only got one right  better call the doctor 😥
Not so squick!
This episode was lacking.
I thought Rhett was gonna talk about ear biscuits at 12:06
existential crisis while opening a pickle jar? hmm who does that remind me of Dan!   like if you get it
EYEBROWS ON FLEEK
LINK WHAT SORT OF FRAMES ARE THOSE
I guess I'm a sociopath.....
"The eyes are the window to whether you're a freakin' sociopath."  *I'M A FRICKEN' SOCIOPATH!!*
7:58 I love it when they do stuff like this like when they did the Will it Deep Fry episode with the world fair frying shop
Damn i stopped the video at the movement before Rhett said "aw you did it" and continued watching so it fit perfectly!
How bad is it that I got literally none of these right? :P
Ah I missed 1. I wasn't sure when I chose so I expected it.
Now these doofuses are encouraging people to self diagnose. Don't do this.
I Googled animals with human teeth about 3 years ago XD
are you ready? I guess.
Yo mikey hmu
Rhett always has the same hair
Do a video like will it figet spinner?
is it normal for me to pass this test?
boiled for safety
Alex's eyes remind me of putin somehow. Do you know if they happen to be related? ;)
8:30 Ellie is having an existential crisis.

I was born on my birthday

May the Fourth be with you
Animals with human teeth sort of creep me out so you don't have to worry about me Googling that. o.O
Rhett said on fleek defendtly a cool dad
I took their test way too seriously and got them wrong xD Aka if Rhett and Link ever make quizzes always go with the silliest option xD

May the 4th be with you👹👹👹

why did the chicken cross the road? cuz 789! why was 6 scared of 7? to get to the other side!  am i missing something?
Is it bad that I tried on all of the questions but only got one right?
I would love to have a dad like Rhett or Link
That face in the thumbnail makes link look like a molester     Or a sociopath
When the questions got harder I got them wrong because I didn't understand the words😂
How old is the video of Liz because he hair is long.
GUYS! Do "Will it Cake?" Use different ingredients for the flavor of the cake ;)
I'm a sociopath       Ok time to start the video...
Why can't they explain these big words before they do it ?
most people are
DAAAANNGG Rhett back at it again with the mustard sweatshirt

I think they tested the wrong person for sociopathy.
I got every single one wrong

Do you have a link to Where I can find that super pretty dress from princesses polly? 😍
julia's jacket what is it?
Coachella seems like it's just a social status thing now. Maybe I'm just envious of all the popular, attractive people though.
Remember to raves at your own risk you may never know you just might die
I was just really waiting for geo to say "welcome to your tape" sometime throughout the video
Drum n bass and jungle was built on ecstasy!
White people wear wear traditional Native American garb and it's cultural appropriation.....Kendrick Lamar wears 2 Asian outfits and it's dope?!?!?!  Wtf are you guys talking about?!
the man looks like the guy from toy story who takes woody
Ive noticed lately JK has been making more ad friendly content...
People wear the headdresses at Coachella because it's beautiful, not just to wear it. Lmao
damn bart knows a lot about the plur life. i'm personally a raver cuz im young (20) and he's right there's good vibes all around at raves
how come david finds it embarrassing when white people uses his culture, but when a black person appropiates asian culture hes fine with it ? just a thought i was having.
where i live we have this thing called oh fest and we have. if artists come and play 2 years ago we had Brendon Urie and last year we had kid ink this year it was Jesse McCartney
Where is Viet Lee? I need some potatoes yo!
I'm Native American and it's a sign of disrespect when a person who is not an actual chief wears the head dress.
Suggestion for JK News: 360 degree camera
All the white people made at David is hilarous😂😂😂
Is it Christiano Ronaldo?
when I think of Geo and festivals I think of warped tour
so kendrick wearing traditional chinese clothing is cool but white people wearing indian gear is cultural offensive....
Why do they keep thinking people as filipinos whyyyy!!! But when i heard ronaldo i lowkey thought of magpahanggang wakas😂💀
I would like for everybody to wear my country's traditional costume. It would be dope to see people hanging around with their freaking "pavas" on their head and shit.
FireFly boutta be lit
Julia whats wrong with wearing flowers on your head at coachella?
3:33 - 3:36 the definitely cut something offensive out loooool wish i knew what it was
The actual news starts at 3:40 😉
Coachella is a modern day version of Woodstock hence the near nude/hippie outfits.
Jk at choachella? those would b some interesting vlogs
we dress kike that cause we walk around with weed and molly
THATS WHERE FAZE BLAZIKENS PHONE IS
Sari???? I think tiff is confused lol
people are triggered over something david talked about for two seconds .... fyi those complaining are apart of the sensitive generation too lmao
Geo rockin that Hannah Baker  hair cut
Not everyone at coachella is high??
JK logic is complaining about white people appropriating other people's cultures and putting pictures of Vanessa Hudgens and Gigi Hadid as an example lmao
Oh wtf Julia is right there!
Thanks for recognizing us David! You know how we do.
So white people are gonna get mad at David for telling the truth? Damn.
LOL comment section is full of white tears
Tiff... you can find your phone even if he did shut it off so...he was fckd either way.
its just clothes, how is it wrong to dress a certain way even if it looks like  native American of Indian so if a native American put on a pair of khakis and a buttoned up shirt so would that offend an average American?
I would be so down to go to Coachella with the jk crew! You guys should have it as a fan prize contest :D
Just to let you guys know the guy who created Coachella supports conversion therapy for lgbtqia+ people. So if you're thinking of buying a ticket just know it's funding the ruining of someone's life
It seems like most religious and music festivals have become sex and drug fests.
Why'd you ruin your hair Geo. :(
there's stage coach not the same as weekend 1 or 2 but the equivalence of it
i'm a bad person for judging every single person who goes to coachella, for some reason it's just so fucking obnoxious
Indian clothes are worn by New Age people. They are modern hippies. It's not an Indian costume the way they wear it. They're new age hippies.
LOL Celo green with bleach cream haha
South Asians don't appreciate y'all wearing bindis or saris for cochella. Y'all are more than welcome to wear bindi and sari at indian weddings, diwali,holi etc. but no Cochella. xoxo
DUDE MY FRIENDS THE ONE WHO TACKLED HIM
2:14 HANNAH IS THAT YOU
The hippie clothing has to do with the start of Coachella because coachella was a branch off from woodstock
When white people do it it's cultural appropriation but when black people do it it's trend setters???? Aight
This just shows how old these guys are considering how out of the loop they are with things that involve us, lol.
the last part was epic
the good thing of having a cheap ass phone. no one will try to finnese it
I love Julia's jacket
Lately the comments section has become toxic.
6:00 kung fu kenny  They haven't listened to kendrick lamar's new album
Loooool at the comments. White people gets so pissed when they get told not cultural appropriate.
Seriously Bart? Coachella is not like that. i made no friends and went home to my hotel everyday. My friends are pretty hot and no one did anything slutty
Have these old people ever been to coachella? I didn't see people being slutty or cultural appropriation. We weren't "high as fuck" either. And I did VIP but hung out in GA a lot. No one was fucking. Im 19 btw.
My dads name was Reynaldo
Geo cut her hair again?! I thought you wanted to grow it out girl!
Dude cultural appropriation is sooooo fucking stupid if ur wearing because you like not because u want to offend someone then go ahead people are so FUCKING soft nowadays
When you wear jeans, business suit or polos then wouldn't be cultural appropriation too? Exactly
I'm half PakIstani and I couldn't give a flying fuck what people wear
White person wears something Indian it's a problem while a black man wears Chinese clothes no problem
Im from Australia. What the fuck is coachella?
so we're calling every single phone an iPhone now?
Hahah i ain't even mad at this guy 😂😂
The dude looks like he stole xmas
psytrance for molly and acid
Why is it that david complained about people wearing native american themed outfits, but didn't say anything when bart complimented kendrick lamar wearing an asian themed outfit
Smh, so many people in comment section don't know the history and what the head dress means.
Wearing head dresses without earning them is f*ed up
lmao, the picture
their ties are annoying, freaking make them tighter!
Could someone tell me what episode this is?
Pinks is great
Employee of the month with a hair transplant?
what a sad bunch of egotistical  pricks
The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end, your highness
Lol that self EoTM dude is so nervous
Call NINOOOOOO!!
narcissistic
You can tell the guy in black wanted to kill gordan just by his expression
Hows he know what a flip flop tastes like?
"It's fucking rancid!"XD
How many fucking wrinkles does Ramsay have on his forehead lol
Tastes like a flip flop...wtf did he try that???
Fkn kiss ass with the douche spikes for hair.
WHERES THE LAMB SAUUUCE!
what is he cutting in the background I always wonderd
I bet when he drinks he's an annoying wanker.
Unasked for nudity. Sexual assault.
I don't get how restaurant owners don't try their own food and then wonder why they're doing bad. Or food could ever come from the kitchen cold, especially to Ramsay.
"Pink's the new black" oh please you didn't plan to raise awareness for breast cancer
Wtf is Nino?  Legit have no idea what all these comments are about
tastes like Gandhi's flip fop
well, thats it for this restraunt...
shut up Ramsay. I've been to your burger place and your fries are nasty / stale..
not my proudest fap
hahahahhahahahaaaa!
At the end when Gordon made them both try it they looked at each other like, I don't think it's that bad.
"Gordon's gonna love our food." lol no chance in hell mate.
Employee of the Month, must be an American thing
his outro is so soggy
I hate how staged this show can be at times. Yeah, I'm sure they didn't scout out the Employee of the Month thing out well before shooting this scene.
Lol this is funny
that guy looks like a cock in the picture.
no wonder hes the only employee of the month.. he knew them sucks
I understand these guys might not be the smartest or best at what they do, but if anyone talked to me the way Ramsay talks to people, I'd fucking hit 'em. Square in the jaw.
How do these morons own a hotel but don't know how to do anything?
0:48 And the fucking cameraman zooms in on his ass. Legend
that's some next level dick sucking
WHERE'S THE LAMB SAUCE?
NIIIIINNNNNNNNOOOOOOOO!
lol the shoulder shrug at the end, great tip off xD
Stooges? Yet only allows 30 second ads 🤔
play the rest! i wanna see the drama not just the tasting
damn is this real?
three people two brain cells
what episode is this?
Gordon will be shooting some lamb sauce out of his donkey cock after he gets that lap dance
They sound like robots lol
FUCK YOU GORDON ,YOU SELFISH ,SHIT STIRRER , BULLY BASTERD, STOP INSULTING PEOPLE,
WHERE'S THE LAMB SAUCE
would not want a lap dance from that guy wtf
"I guarantee he's going to love it!" *2 minutes later* "Tastes like a donkeys cock"
Did he like the bread?
Are these new episodes that aren't on Hulu?
gordon shut up
what episode and season is this ?
HI IM NIIIIIINNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Stop swearing
Please mention the season and episode so we can find the whole video.
Kevin Clerico the bartender looking like Fredo Corleone
which episode is this?  anyone knows? PLEASE?
Nino Would Own This Much Better
WHICH EPISODE IS THIS?!?!?!
Can someone explain this Nino meme pls
Bunch of idiots
"The moment he tastes this food, it's going to put a smile on his face" *30 seconds later*  "THE FOOD TASTED LIKE A DIRTY FUNKY FLIP FLOP" Ol mate ditching his niggas when the going gets tough
I'd do that
Hey everyone, today I'm going to show you what when you attack the wrong lines...
this cant be real lmao!!!
Why are they posting clips of episodes that aired years ago?
Only Brits like this little bitch Ramsay can get away with being divas.  American men have to act like adults and be respectable.
I saw the title and thought of NIIIIIIINNNNNNOOOOOOO
2:38 vietnamese flashback
Don't you love it when the Employee of the month doesn't remember the Specials
Gordon Ramsey is a dick!
Whenever I hear someone say Gordon is really gonna love the food and be blown away, I'm just like  Boy, you have no fuckin idea how bad he's gonna destroy the food
That Employee of the Month looks like the guy from All Star
jaiden guided me here
"Honestly I've never tasted these in my life" YEAH RIGHT LOL 😂
Ehh they just need a better cook, better more modern interior ,and to organise their roles for their business.
Hate Gordon
when your teacher asks you to rate your group and you give yourself the best mark even though you did nothing
1:38 that gulp though
When Gordon Ramsay fucks: "" Let the dick do the work
Keep making these gordon, find it hilarious
F-rozen, I-nedible, N-asty, E-xcriment. That's my favorite kind of dining.
"Are the icecubes frozen?" "Yes" "Are you fucking kidding me?"
How did these guys get to be in charge of a business? They don't seem mature or intelligent. I don't get it.
Employee of the month award remindes me of Buddy from cake boss who nominated himself once.
thank you so much .
The Democrat Party lost America's first Civil War because they enslaved Black people.  Democrats will lose the second Civil War because they attempted to enslave our unborn progeny... 
Federal Government is TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL...Remember the American Revolution.
No surprises here.
This is why we need to get rid of the IRS as it is outlawing FREE SPEECH Totally rediculous This is the craziness we have to stand up and fight
So we learned something today... when someone films vertically things always go wrong.
Do not like this comment
Dude, I got it on camera...
Let's all just "sub" one another am I right!?
way to get to the point 18 seconds not to much not to little
How is this trending?
lol wow, he should've turned off the camera when the guy jumped down...but without it, it wouldn't have been funny! OMG his reaction to the fall after the guy's okay "dude, I got it on camera" lolol
did no one else notice the naked guy or woman in the green boat
dumbass whitepeople
Great friends there.....bro shouting he dead b4 he even hits the water lmao
What a dumb fuck!!
He should be dead he basically belly flopped 50 feet sooo...
This is a very badly titled suicide video.
"He's dead..." Not a single f*ck was given by this guy.
Someone assassinate the cameraman ffs!
Why is this trending, and not my video where I make the Sun??
why did this all of a sudden trend
Can't fix stupid
DISLIKE THE VIDEO. WE CAN MAKE IT HAVE MORE DISLIKES THAN LIKES. FUCK THE TRENDING ALGORITHM.
I have jumped off that bridge more than a few times...
I Cant Believe This Is On The Trending Tab         WHen Its From 2013
what's even more pathetic than this video is that people have time to comment their 2cent opinion.  Who gives.
I've jumped off this 😂
I think this video is trending because it was filmed vertically..
the real fail is you recording in portrit mode
4 year old video trending? Shut up people, the trending system is not broken.
LOL after the guy who filmed it says I got it on camera the guy who jumped said "YES!"
*SUICIDE IS BADASS*
I cant believe this video had under 6k views yesterday, and after being 3 years old, it randomly ends up on Trending and blows up to 240k views
Was this in Maine?
hold your phone horizontally
Person filming vertically is a bigger idiot than the guy who failed the jump.
I got it on caymra
Scrolling down looking for comments complaining about how atrocious it is that this was filmed in portrait mode.
Hey, at least he got it on camera!
thats gonna leave a bruise
Wow smart man
Where are stuff like this coming from it did not originate from YouTube or Reddit
can anybody spot the other fail?
Suicide is badass
Yay more shitty memes. Why is this trending?
White people
"You wanna know how I got these scars? I jumped off a bridge three years ago. Shit, what was I thinking?"
trending is trash
The guy filming and laughing is such a douche. Only one person there seemed to care he was alright. That's a good friend. Drop the others.
"I got it on camera!"   If only you could record the video FUCKING HORIZONTALLY
How is this and trending and WTF VERTICAL FILMING
There's always that dumbass kid who asks if ur alright when he clearly saw what just happened to him😂
How the hell did this video take 3 years to trend?
Is that Brownfield Bridge??
He could be on the Olympic dive team
"I got it on camera" wha are we in 2006?
Just as dumb as my videos.
Why is a three year old shit video trending.
Why is this trending now after 3 years?!?!?!
Same bridge they did that cool basketball dunk with the hanging hoop, whoops I was thinking hoops what I meant to say was dead body
I got up there once.... and that is exact reason why I pussed out.
Wow of corse the only video to trend from my state is a trash video.
How is this trending? #whatthetrump
can you guys give my channel some views please lol
Is the bridge alright?
3 YEARS AGO WTF
where is this on the Saco?
why is this on trending it is so old
Mom: Would you jump off a bridge if your friends told you to? Kid: Yeah! Mom: *shows video* Kid: omw
"he's dead" most realistic reaction
Yum that booty tho
So epic lol oh how we overuse epic these days!
oooooomaigis
0:03 *It was at this moment that he knew...* *He F*cked up !*
#thatsusmainersforya
"He's Dead"
Is he always at the same Subway station? If I ever go to NY I'm gonna  look for him!
Respect for you all!
Om gosh.....one of the best singers I've ever heard!!! I love this trio...they are amazing
Damn, I didn't want that harmony to end! CHILLS!
124 people got off at the wrong station
WOOOOOOOOOOWOWOWOWOWOWWO I HAVE NO WORDS. HE ALMOST SANG THIS AS GOOD AS SAM COOKE
omg so powerful and soulful
I bet that HUG he got from the Lady passing was worth a 1,000$$ #TrueSpirit
crazy how people just walk by like he not even there #Lostsouls
I am boohoo crying right now
its been a long time comin but I knoooow a "trains" gunna come :) beautiful Mike I hope you get to record more, all the best.
This may sound strange but I would love this played at my Funeral. I listen to this at least once a day.  You sound amazing and I would love to hear you sing.
0:08 gets me every god damn time. It hits my soul! I get goosebumps every time and damn near to tears. Beautiful!
I literally want to hug him oh my
Wow thats really good singing
I hope a change is gonna come for him, he deserves to be on the big stage
People like this don't have a pot to piss in with this much talent, meanwhile pop singers have millions of dollars. Pisses me the fuck off..
This made me cry. I'd give my left testicle to be able to do something this beautiful.
Oh when that girl hugged him... *feels*
OMG OMG OMG OMG....PHENOMENAL
I REALLY LOVE THAT GUY BUT THAT DRUMMER AND THE GUITAR ARE FAKE AS FUCK !
Saw him once in Union Square with just the guitar player. Beautiful voice
Sensational!!!  How can they all walk past him!!!!
omg this guy needs a record label!!
he would be awesome at a wedding
Holy shit.  I wish I could see him live.
me at the start of the video: "ok bunch of guys busking in a subway.." 5 seconds later: "well dang.."
The first word is veeeeeeeeeeery impressive
If he was good he wouldnt sing there.
I don't know how anyone could dislike this video...
Yo I just realised this is the 2000th video I've ever favourited. Pretty good video to land on that number not gonna lie.
I'd just on the floor and listen and listen and listen.
We need more of this man. The LOVE is real!!
That "I said brotha, help me please!" at 1:21 sounds so cool! I almost want to sample it and chop it up
So many people walking by.  How could you not stop?
...and at the end some else get the fucking views, damn
awesome!!!!!!!!!!
I'm sick of these bathroom singers in TV shows. This guy is a real talented singer. No ego. Just his heart and voice.
This is way better than what the gypsies play
If Justin burner can get internet famous but this guy can't then wtf is wrong with the world
Drummer was pretty cool. When the harmonies came in is what did it for me.
in the station like "Guess ima be late to work"
This could be a buskers anthem if he retitled it 'some change is gonna come'.
holy crap...he would win any of the Talent shows...imagine that voice in an auditorium with decent acoustics...or a studio recording...go for it man, you have the voice!  Thanks!
I'll probably just call in sick if I see this....
holly jebus fooking christ
wow amazing
How is this guy not touring the planet?!
could be John Witherspoon
Are you kidding me? He's fucking incredible
Great job. Best of luck to you sir! :)
Hell yeah, Phill
Love that Big Pun shirt
Photoshoped.
I wanna hear this!!1! give him a job pls
Get this man a recording studio so I can hear that soul even better.
You've got to be pretty fucking good to sound this way in a subway station on a cellphone
Wow. His voice leaves me speechless.
le reddit army is here.
I can not believe how good this guy is!! I'm in love with this song! Does anyone know anyone who is similar?
someone sign this man a record deal!
why is he still performing in the subway this man needs an album, a news story, a care package...something! lul
His voice is incredible, it's a shame that popular music is controlled by people who don't care for it.
that fat joe t shirt tho r.i.p
God... you are incredibly amazing! Wow.. So strong.. with much feelling..
Please get him into a booth!
Damn, that was good.  and yes, reddit.
Fucking beautiful
smooth as fuck
pfff this is so pure, this is soul, this is jazz, this is true music.
Wow,  was the first word to come out. Great voice, singing from the heart.
Surprise teared up...goosebumps!:) You're amazing Mike!
THIS IS AMAZING
Truly talented musicians, sad to see so many people walk past and not take a couple of minutes out of their day to appreciate real talent and beautiful music.
give these guys a recording contract
I might believe in god now.
77 people are actual pieces of shit.

Do a meet with Noriyaro
Wow, that was shit drifting. U suck.  here's a tip,  don't use a chaser
have you ever watched these clips and wondered what the lap tines would be if dudes weren't trying to drift?
*Why You didn't take Nicole to Japan???*
Wow drifting with mark wahlberg must be fine
*love your vids*
In future videos can you tell us about the tire Situation and how much they cost
WHO NEEDS G-BALLZ WHEN YOU HAVE SHIT ROLLING AROUND ON THE FLOOR! I HAVE SHIT THAT SLIDES ON MY DASH WHEN IM GETTING DEEP!
I know your not doing much bmx anymore but check this out my  7 year old daughter qualified for worlds to represent the United States of America in bmx https://www.gofundme.com/help-my-daughter-get-a-bmx-starting
Adam you need to see if you can find a suction cup for your go pro for some more angles that would be great keep up the great videos.
Do a walk around and show the cars in storage
weeeee were going in
10:08 whys there a guy in the woods

That poor R-33 :(
Kaspars? About what Kaspars the guy in the end of the video was talking about?
'' This part right here is soo much fun---  not again"
carry on good
Ur a beast, but  just an unlucky boy 😫
Love these Tokyo videos so pumped to have them every day
Are there any asians there? All i see is white boys
haha im a south african vlogger! just bought a supra shell and building my first .comp drift car. check it out
you should mount go pros around your car to get different angles
"Just casually eating twizzlers". Lol that's me
EVERYONE  PLEASE FOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM  EXALTEDROYALTYCARS for shout out
lol i feel like adam was bleeping out the swear words going man this SHITS annoying hahah
Do the footcam drifting pls! It'll be interesting to see actually.

Loving the videos! Why did you ask about South African vloggers? Just curious because I'm from South Africa and it would be sick to see you out here!!
how old are you? , ear you talking is like ear a 11 years old
... did i see a nori

South African Vlogger// Mr. Been Brown. He lives there but is also British..
3rd day on it and hitting it big boy style! Good on you Adam!
@adamlz can we see more of your Japan experience?
YOU ARE SHREDDING
i had no idea Matt Damon was into drifting lmfao....
can you get taylor to go behind you and record with the go pro so we can see what it looks like from the outside
pause at 7:51
hi Adam lz ,Lebo from south Africa and I like your vids a lot and I hope u keep up the good work and don't worry about togy u going up there .I hope I can get a shout out  and your south Africa views are watching
Loving the Japan videos but need more Japanese culture your videos are like half an hour of just drifting gets kinda boring
"Touching tips" is kinda homosexual. You just want to be next to each other side by side and compare. You don't need to do tip to tip thing Taylor. That doesn't even look cool man.
i feel like taylor should be there, he can drift. adam threw a bunch of money at drifting to force his skill's to drift. so unstylish. #nonnaturlaskillset
South African Vlogger, Boom!  Hey Adam, how can we help, wanna drift in South Africa? This isn't my personal YouTube channel, but I drift, vlog and get up to some cool adventures. Give me a shout. Cheers, Ricardo
I bet Nicole is bord.
The guy that Adam was in the car with seems super friendly and is a good drifter :)
loving the drift track videos
where is alexi
that poor r33
So much for Bmx. Outside views look better than helmet cam 24/7.
Deon is South African? It all makes sense now! xD
2end gear for life ;)
I'm not a vlogger but I am from South Africa :)
Your getting GOOD tho!
birdy is in japan too
Could you do a gopro chin mount please, the viewing experience would be better also it wouldn't mess with people like me that have ocd, great vids though.
That Yellow FD tho........
Tbh you should've just stayed in the states and made yourself look like less of a gaijin
#FeedBackTime   I would love if you would stop with the * peeps * when saying Fuck or something like that, it's annoying my ears.
Name of the song at the ending of the video? thanks!
Vlog outside of the tracks, like the places you visit and the people you meet.
Put the GoPro on the outside of the car. Like the roof or rearside. Thats some awesome footage!
CHEATER LZ !!!
LZ Drift now, no more BMX it seems 😟
Im a South African vlogger😃
What Toyota is that?
u drift like a grandmother
Adam hows your simulator coming along or is it complete and working XD
Lol that guy looks like bald matt damon
The amount of Aaron content is too much.
Taylor looks like he's slimmed down
booooooring
Adam if you see this try a little less hand brake and more throttle on entry around the north course long corner  flick it and clutch kick try no hand brake  keep up the great drift vids
Adam I miss the 240sx
Where the fuck is Alexi!!!!!
Where is alexi btw?
Im from South Africa!!!
your entries are so sloppy and sketchy lmao dont flick it if you're just gonna enter on the inside anyways
Yeah you need more gopros we need a outside view. just a inside view gets boring for this 25 minute videos
Before you leave Japan can you please to an hour long montage of all the cars that are there coz I saw a mad supra and ide like to see more than just jzx's
i like matt demon(ik its damon i wanna kill with demon cause he swear a lot)
When I saw that skyline, I thought it was Alexi, Would be awesome if you met him.
19:46 R.I.P FD
Arron reminds me of Matt Damon
My favorite baby phase was before they start walking lol after that it's complete mayhem 😂

I love your Vlogs
Your vlogs are the best!!! Make more!! :)
Love you Vlogs! I bet there's never a dull moment with Ryan LOL!
I love watching these type of videos!
wen my son was 3 years old that was de best time 😊
Oh my goodness!  Those baby pictures are Carter!
My parents tried for 13 years before they had me. Don't give up, guys! ❣️
9-12months was my favorite! He was so mobile and laughed a lot. Everything interested him and he got into so much!! So fun!
Hi Brittany!  I always enjoy your cleaning videos. Can you please tell me where both of your zipped up sweaters are from?  They are so cute!  Thanks!
My cousins baby had a mullet up until a month ago! It went all the way down his back.
6-9 months is my fave :)
I loved every stage of both of my babies. The hardest stage is the moving out stage.
Oh my god, love the video because I love cleaning/organising videos. But Baby Carter is just sooooo cute ☺️☺️ oh my goodness the smiles and raspberries are just so lovely. Thank you for sharing your vlog xx
When it comes for cleaning you inspire so so so much. I love the way you keep your home! Respect!
My favorite age for my baby so far has been 9 months! She's 11 months right now. Our oldest daughter(my step daughter) is 8. I really loved when she was 4 years old. That's when they start getting really independent!
I love you so much! This video didb't pop up to my subscribed section. I thought somehow i'd been unsubscribed from you :/ luckily it popped up on my home page though. anyways ilyyyyy
Please keep making these types of videos! I love them <3
Clean countertops are my thing. It improves my mood and motivation so much. Hoping I can keep on top of everything as well as you when my baby boy comes along ❤️
Loving your vlogs! thanks x
Britany, I am really happy for you! My cousin tried for 9 years.. In-vitro, medicine and what not... Now they have twins and a third one (she was not even planned!) <3
You guys are the best! I love watching your videos, but especially your vlogs! ❤️
I like the vlogs
The best stage for me is age 4-5 my daughter is 5 now and she is so funny. I sometimes miss the small cute little baby clothes tho.
luv when they're around 1-2 , they start to talk & walk & do all kinds of cute stuff !
6-15 months. They are still pretty content to hang out with you & they are just full of personality. 2 was ok. 3 is not so fun, 4-5 makes you wonder what you where thinking. But my 2 are so different.
12-18 mo was my fav! They are starting to walk and talk and are so sweet and helpful!
Thank you for sharing! My husband & I are trying & it does get frustrating - thank you for like sting your tips for us!
oh how i wish it was that easy... i have a few kids and after cleaning it only last for a few min... it easy with 1 kid... cant wait till my kids get older... but for now they help with the cleaning..
Our little ones have the same exact birthday! Love your channel! ❤️
peanut butter and eggs!! ewww Ryan
Whatever stage my kids are is my favorite! They are 4.5 and 3.... I think as they get older is easier on the mom. Congratulations on your beautiful family... Ryan is hilarious!
YOU GUYS ARE THE CUTEST LITTLE FAM OMG GOALLLS heheh sorry for caps love youuuu xoxox
love the video. You should do a video on how you organized every cabinet in your kitchen. Baby Carter is so adorable!
I love your videos and you always give the best advice. I'm the same as you, I do a lot of research on just about anything and you are making my life so much easier !
I think the best months are when they could crawl and sit up on they're own wish my baby could stay that small again now she's about 15 months and growing 😢😄
How do you look so flawless all the time 😍 I'm expecting my first and I look like a potato all the time
How on earth does she manage cleaning, staying put together, taking care of her family, youtube videos and a new born child?!! Would love to see a video on how you're a superwoman? (:
LOVE These vlogs ! You are the cutest family. You are such a great mother and wife Brittany ! Thanks for your videos! <3
Your doing great I love seeing you and your little fam - too too cute ❤️
The 3-6 month age is the cute cuddly stage, and then you fall More in love during the 1-2 year and 3-4 years...basically you keep falling in love with them on each stage lol ❤
love your vlogs!
Your round sunglasses are beautiful!!!!
Love your vlogs, they are so fun to watch and I love seeing Carter grow up! ❤️ But he is growing way too fast 😭
Ryan's having a pregnant woman's lunch. Completely odd and makes no sense😂
My favorite age group is around 6 months and up, but before 12 months. My daughter is 4 now and it is nice, but she still throws tantrums, so its hard, especially since I am prego!
whats the name of the light behind the tv and where can you buy it?
I've been loving these vlogs!!!
You're always so organized, it inspires me to do the same with my space! I'm just a little bit surprised that you run the dishwasher every night for a very small amount of dishes, that seems like a lot of water..
What's the name of the paint color in your kitchen?  I love that shade of gray.
I love the vlogs
Hi Brittany, I love watching your videos and so is my 4 year old lol You are just naturally so likable and have a beautiful family.  God bless, take care 😊
Keep it REAL.....highly doubt u "clean" with full fledge makeup and ur hair to the side.....comeon!!  love MeganLeigh (lavitademeg) now she keeps it 100% real n thats why we love her!
What size do you get the tank tops in?
My favorite age with my daughter was 6-8 months! Love your videos😺
I can only imagine how happy you must have been to find out you were pregnant! My husband and I have been trying for 15 months (I have PCOS) and whenever I find out I'm pregnant I'll probably fall apart haha.
Egg whites, pnut butter and banana??? Lmao That man and his culinary master piece and socks......they all speak for themselves! lol!! I'm happy for you guys!!
LOVVEEEE your vlogs! The length and content is just perfect!!
I'm LOVING these vlogs, you guys are the cutest ❤️  I was like if she hates Ryan's cup why would she link it, until I clicked on it Hahahaha too funny 😂
needed this. having a lazy morning 😂
You guys are too funny! Example of a good relationship right there😄 love the style of the vlog, gonna go clean my kitchen now 😆😅
You're amazing and so is Baby Carter!
Month after month with non baby is hard. We found out I was infertile and it took us 6 years to get our baby through IVF. He's 5 now and I adore him. My favourite age was probably about 2 when he was toddling about
I loved six to 10 months!!! Why does the baby stage only last one year 😭😭💕
the way ryan said delish 😂
Both of my children are 7 and 4 years old. I loved the baby stage but I really enjoyed when they were 1 and 2 years old.. I love what they would start talking and the things they saw were so cute and funny!
I love your vlogs so much! Please don't stop hahah
Holy shit that's me!!

is this the original meme ?????
at a funeral? nahh
I genuinely love the internet.
Is it okay to laugh?
If they were paid more, more people would probably become teachers. I think they should be paid more
id take 2000 a month if i had the amount of holidays teachers had
teachers in some parts of indonesia only make less than $200 / month :(
no they should not. and they should be paid on quality of work too.
Nope.  Do you think entrepreneurs should be taxed less? The people who do the most for society and take huge risks to get towards.
My school has bad teachers though
They do deserve a lot of money for their work but if we pay them a regular amount or more people will become teachers for the money not the job itself
lol so who does more work a teacher or a mechanic?? i only make 976 after tax
on the flip side it's a monday-friday gig, plenty of holidays off, and they get the whole summer off. They physically don't work as many hours throughout the year as other professions.
GOOD ONES: YES. BRAINWASHED ONES: NO.
teachers is our parents too !!
Teachers also only work 9 months out of the year. On a rate basis, they make a fair amount
They should be paid less.
more taxes seems like a great idea. Pay teachers more
Easy NO THEY DO NOT! Most teachers are a bunch of assholes towards their students. And some of them don't respect the students
I made it through 5 years of college, got a degree, passed a highly selective national exam to get certified, I started teaching in 2006 and I now get 2000€ a month, more or less. Ladies and Gents, welcome to France 😒
My mom has been a special ed teacher in the same school district for 16 years. She has never received a raise. Thanks, South Dakota...
lol more than 1k$ per week. In Russia teachers get less than 1k$ per month.
I myself want to be a teacher and even though the pay is so low, I still want to do it. Just the thought of being able to help kids learn and being able to help people grow is really what motivates me
I hate my teacher it seems like she works for free
I think there needs to be stricter standards for people to become teachers and I think because of having stricter standards they should get significant raises
I believe that after doctors, teachers should be the next highest paid people.
I live in Latvia. Minimum salary here is 380 eur and some teachers are earning as low as 500 eur a month.
This is honestly just devastating. Very sad. I hardly know anybody that wants to go into education because it's such a low paid, under valued profession.
You know what that means less money everyone else will be making because of taxes
Meanwhile bitches on welfare get payed a similar amount for doing absolutely nothing...
not surprising considering many scientists are paid much less
I think teachers in US get good amount of money if you compare it to the teachers all around the world like teachers get around $800 in turkey.
Why shouldnt they be paid more? This video is pointless and I'm pretty sure everyone thinks they should be paid more.
School funding is anchored to property prices. Want a six-figure teaching job? Move somewhere where homes start at $1 million.
This is why I stopped wanting to be a teacher because I know the pay sucks and I'd just struggle a lot
School the way it is set up now is outdated and no longer relevant. By the time the kids learn from the text books information has all ready made them obsolete.
THEY DESERVE WAY MORE!!
Good teachers get paid more with SCHOOL CHOICE! The problem is bad teachers have tenure, and unions won't fire them.
some teachers work hard and with passion and should be rewarded some don't.
The worse part about my teacher buying school supplies is they end up getting lost or stolen.
I've had some really good teachers who I think definitely deserve more, but most of my teachers have been disgusting pieces of crap that don't deserve a single benefit of dollar
Not saying I dont believe teachers should be paid more, but I think we should acknowledge that they only work 75% of the year
haha! Nope.
It all depends what they teach and to what level, like a home ec teacher shouldnt get paid the same as someone who teaches advance science to seniors
They get paid to much up in Canada
NAHHH FAK THESE HOES
GIVE OUR TEACHERS A BETTER SALARY!!!! THEY DESERVE IT MORE THAN ANYONE!!!
Come be a teacher in Canada.
Teachers should be paid with the thought that they have taught a pupil that could possibly change the world or be know throughout the world
I have teachers who inspire and encourage. They are not only teachers, but friends and advisors.  The teacher makes all the difference in how I do in school. Teachers should earn a lot of money, they are amazing.
Teachers should only be paid more if they deserve it. Better teachers with a sense of passion should get more money, otherwise we'd be promoting lazy teaching.
I think teachers should be paid from $75,000-$100,000
all my teachers are bitches they can be fired thanks
I feel like giving all the teachers in my school money now.
I don't know why but I think teachers in our country don't care about their students.
Lol American problems
Why should they make more if they don't even prepare us for our future careers? All I learned in high school was useless information.
Well for starters, how about you stop overpaying school administrators $100k California?
Bro, thats ur country. Singapore teachers are being paid $4,000 per month and i appreciate them but at the same time im so jelous that their rich😄😧😐
Teaching as a job in general should be paid more, but some of the teachers I've had are so incompetent there is no way they deserve to be paid more.
If they're anything like my teachers then no.
My mother was a teacher and me and my sister lived paycheck to paycheck. She puts in a lot of work and I don't think people realize that. They need to be getting they coin.
Teachers should be teaching kids that BuzzFeed is racist cancer
They work half the year. Summer+ vacation time in between. If they worked the full the salary would double
Actually they get paid more than that my cousin started her new job as a teacher but she gets 45000$
and they get paid even less in private schools :(
and they get paid even less in private schools :(
I think teachers should have more money I thought every year in total they get 5,000,000 dollars 😢
Teachers are paid what they're worth.  It's a supply and demand market.  If it weren't so easy to become a teacher and it was a more specialized field they would make more.
I'll teach for $500 a week. They make 4 times the amount as me. So yes they are being over paid.  Why don't they just tax the parents more and me not at all since I have no kids?
Spent $500 on school supplies?  I wish.  I've spent over $2,000 (and the school year isn't over yet).
How you gon pay the people that literally shape the minds of our children such a small amount of money? That seems shady to me
teachers work so hard to get the job and we (not all) just don't care about school. and they don't even get paid that much, even YouTube's get paid more then them.
If teachers got paid more, they might be able to afford to live in Cali.  I want to be a teacher and I though, "Wow I should teach in California then.  Oh, but  I couldn't afford to live there."
if they do their job then yes pay them more.
I think they should get paid a little more! I know they made us for what we are, but think about the Goverment to.. if they have to pay them than there won't be as much good education for us!
Working hard in college to become the greatest teacher I can be!
I was so shocked about the first death and who it was lol jk.

Truth will be here forever.
My childhood heroes are all retiring. Tmac and Iverson was heartbreaking, now all the other legends :( actually makes me feel old and sad.
Who cares? You ain't LeBron
Isaiah Thomas "The Tooth"
we'll miss TRUTH one of the best small fowards to ever play
When i saw "tribute to paul pierce" i thought what oh ok paul pierce died. Rip.   But when i click oh just a retirement..
I feel sad that Ray Allen wasn't in this video
Dude is so underrated!! What a great career PP #TheTruth
Man that means there are only Dirk, Jason Terry, and Vince left of the pre 2000 era of basket ball;(
Time to hang my Celtic PP jersey to the wall.Extreme love for  the T R U T H.
156 people gave this a thumbs down. Haters should keep their hate to themselves. Nobody cares lol
Yo where is ray allen at ... i thought he'd say something here
Interesting how Ray wasn't there... But that's none of my business
end of the kobe and pual pierce era they will be missed
Happy retirement to The Truth Paul Pierce T.T
who the fuck is cutting onions right now
Just wondering where is the link to Scalabrine's tribute video???
Don't go man, just come back.
Wow they really hate Ray Allen
Fuck Pierce and that bitch ass Garnett, never liked'em
1:56 the goat right there
1:49 had me bawling
#ThankYouTruth
Music at the beginning? Gives off that 'He Got Game' feel
never forget in 2001 playoffs Alan Iverson and Paul Perice going at eachother...crazy times
RIP paul :(
Pierce, Garnet, Allen, you guys were the best the Celtics ever had!!!!
I can't imagine what happened when Vince Carter announces his retirement, the last 1998 class
WTF! I thought he died and i search the Internet! crazy... this much the guys I knew... Classic! one of the best player again retired...
this made me cry I love Paul so much
wow, paul pierce just made one of the biggest trash talkers in nba history cry. that means something
When the goat scalabrine is in your tribute video it's something special
THANK YOU PAUL FROM ALL BOSTON CELTICS FANS.
kobe totally knew who knew the pickup game he's just trying to nice
Always loved to hate him.
Why are you crying his not dead 💀
where Ray Allen at?
They are talking like he just died. wtf is with this video? I was hoping some highlights.
Pierce made me a basketball fan again☘️
He got out played by a real veteran.  Iso Joe.
Beautiful video.  Got a little dusty in the theater seeing KG start to tear up like that, you can feel how close they are.
He Left his blood sweat and tears on the floor. No doubt about that. Ra Sha Jayhawk..... K....uuuuuuu!
Where was ray allen?
they making it seem like he died😂
dude was too young to die. RIP paul pierce.
Y'all act like he died or something

Gotta love K.G. shout to the truth we love u.
Tell me why my dumbass thought he died 😂
Thx god I got Paul pierce in my NBA live mobile line up
PIERCE > COBY TBH
thank you Paul
D. Green you'll never get the truths type of respect.
Only if only The Sixers drafted him second overall instead of Larry Hughes, that team would've been unstoppable (they were amazing without him at that time, just imagine with him).
but he aint kobe
Heard this song 1 second ago and damn now it's my fave
If Lana and Abel can be a couple, my life would be completely totally utterly extremely completed.
it's official  the weeknd is by far my most favorite artist ever
So many views on a lyric video
Soon good. These two just compliment each other very well.
I FUCKING CANT SDJFHAJKSDGHDFJG
The dislikes are from multiple accounts of Justin Bieber.
This is the first song that I don't like from Lana. No offense just my opinion, but it doesn't mean I don't like her.  I wonder if Lana and Nicki Minaj does a collab. :D Is it possible harhar.
When The Weeknd sings, "yeah" at 1:18 :)
Just can't stop thinking at my girl right now .This song is eargasm <3
My two favorite singer the weenknd and lana del rey <3  Now I'm crazy about this two :o
Digging all the brand new Lana fans acting like they've been around since the beginning.
Who else has come because of BTS?
my favourites 💕 lana and the weeknd
I'm in love
I like this song ☺wow......?
I want more duets together!! With them possibilities are endless!
Where the fuck is Iggy Pop?
"Hey, it's Selena, Selena Gomez. This one is about the witch who stole my love. Lana, welcome to your tape"
i can't get rid of this song😢❤this song is fire🔥
I would say this isn't really the weekends fortè
i just hate it.
also i bet takeoff from migoz super thrilled. lol
Eae Pessoal Suave
There must be ppl who really cum hearing this song "takeee offf take offf take of all ure clothes" ☺️ music these days🙃
LIKE YES THE I LOVE IT
"they say only the good die young that just ain't right cause we're having too much fun"
The part when Lana sings "take off, take off all your clothes" reminds me to Without You, in the part of "hello, hello. C-can you hear me now?"
have nothing to say ,it is life,not only a song
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS
fuck, why do i hate it so much? i've never disliked a lana song :(
Blue skys and lemonade forever
who is upchirch?
ive played this song so much and im hyping it SOOO HARD
I just wanna see you shine cause I know you are a Stargirl ...
Two of the sexiest voices in my opinion. If some dude sang to me like how The Weeknd sounds here...ooh boy 😘
if this is the official "audio" i cant imagine the video
Get off my woman
This is so good! Definitely Born to Die album vibes but with the added dimension time gives :)
Perfecto!!!
How did they get on top of the Hollywood sign?! but pretty cool
http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7777011/artist-dominate-2017-vote-poll  Vote for Lana baby
that goddess voice, never heard a voice so mesmerizing.
this makes me wanna fall in love and dance on the H of the hollywood sign
hypnotizing you can calm downl snakes with your voice,i'm not a snake,but my anger vanish at the sound of your voice
Lana's "saddest" songs don't make me as "sad" as this one. i'm alone...
they should make an album together
This song is so beautiful ♥
0:45 that was a kiss?
adeus fulano
where's the video!?
this song is so perfect
Even though they are saying lust for life, I hear lust for love, keeps us alive. I think it is more fitting.
first time time listing: meh that's a shitty song  second time: it's not that bad tho third time: that's a good song i'm diggin' it  forth time : nigguh that shit is hella dope
The part where lana sings 'take off, take, take off all your clothes, take off, take off' SOUNDS SO FAMILIAR AND IT KEEPS BUGGING ME AM I THE ONLY ONE???
who came for THE WEEKND
Lana and Weeknd are gonna fuck and suck my ass.
That smile at the end it was the best part.
She's so awesome!!!
-keeps us alive-
I knew it was future barry
The guy holding the philosopher stone looks ripped but barry is lanky af
I knew when Savitar said "I'm the Future Flash!"...
It's not that big a deal I lost my fucking jordans cause I thought it was Ronnie
Do you get to become the flash with that ring??
Is 2024 Barry gonna become savitar ?
Why can't Savitar kill Tracy himself?
how come the only one that was ok was hr he actually benefited form it in 2024
"You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"
i shouldve put monies on savitar
Do u think that might be time remnant Barry from ss2 that died
I am so angry that Barry is Sav. Not cool!
I'm so glad Savitar's Barry, I've been wanting to see Barry meet his evil self since Season 2.
yesss predicted correctly
All I want to know is who built this suit...I mean I know Who built the red suit???....HHmmmmmmm
10:08 this is not Barry..
I wonder if he still have his speed without the armor... Probably
So Rents new lady is going to get wacked in the series finale right?
Disappointing. :-(
It reminds me of Danny Phantom when he had to fight his future self, even the names Danny and Barry look alike
Raising more quetions than answers isn't the mark of a good twist, it's the mark of a Lindelof twist.
i want one ring
yay I was rigt
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become a villian
Is it possible that Savitar/Barry Allen is from a different earth?
I know it's not gonna happen but I want Iris to die...such an annoying character
please explain the difference between the series until now S3E20 with the comics
I honestly thought he might be the blue beetle. SMH
So....how was Barry the first speedster of all time??????????????
Best Theory I read was that Barry takes the V9 serum to go back in time to save Iris. The Serum turns him evil just like Trajectory and the suit prevents him from disintegrating from running.
I'd love a ring dude
I guessed it and was told it was silly because Barry would never kill Iris. Well well well
Can I please have the flash ring
They told Savitar was the first speed star ever existed, now how is that!?
Excited for savitar's explanation
He said Micah and my heart jumped
I really dont think Savitar is the future Barry we met last episode. I liked that future Barry :( I think Savitar is a Barry from a time where a younger Barry did not come and get the team back together.
How can Killer Frost see Savitar when she couldn't see him at the start of the year?
flash ring !!!!wooow
Why does ice powers make Caitlin evil
I still think Bruce Wayne is Savitar
Hi ! corporation Anybody   identify one's better than this result ?% . .
it is future Barry Allen
When I looked at this episode I got mindf*cked so hard hahah..
what is better? emo Barry or two face Barry
I've not fully read the comics but speedsters don't age?
need..that...ring
I thought savitar was supossed to be a buff guy wtf
"You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"
I wish i had placed some bets.I was telling everybody this for months!
How to defeat Savitar: Barry has to kill himself. Simple.
i knew it all the long
yes but why does he want to kill Iris does she take him to the cleaners when they divorce take the kids away from him?
"However long they survive" Jesus. savage!
I actually thought Barry becomes Savitar by killing him. The story I thought this series was getting some material from the Armageddon 2001 event. Referencing the Monarch origin and his psychotic break.
Actually, Espresso has a relatively low caffeine contend compared to other types of coffee ;)
that armor thing when opens gives a much better effect than iron man had ever given . Awesome though i was shocked that it was barry and grant also played it nicely
there's a bigger chance of me winning that flash ring than cisco actually creating it in the show
Thanks for the video! For me, the most confusing part is that Future Barry kills Iris? Like ... what heck?
Am I the only one that likes flashes haircut from last week? The future flashes look wasn't that bad
Do you think Cisco will really lose his arms?
Charlie, do you think Future Barry's message to Professor Stein in Legends of Tomorrow had anything to do with him being Savitar?
How was the team ( Tracey Brand sketch ) able to see Savitar in the factory scene surely they weren't supposed to cause they aren't speedsters
ON THIS VIDEO!!!!!
I knew it was Barry
I won the bet thanks to you
I would love to see Eobard geeking out while meeting Brand.
Agents of SHIELD is way better than The Flash this season, this show sucks! But it gets you views...pathetic lol.
Is it still a reveal if everyone already knew what was gonna happen?
Your so cool
So does that mean Barry is obsessed with megatron? or michael bay? or both?
now im a bit confused savitar said that he lived barrys life before he was savitar the was there another savitar or what? its so confusing.
cheers mate for these videos so good

Not even skipping the two and a half minute ad just to further support family friendly Francis.
Fucking Family Time
Over 6 minutes on  ONE incident...yawn.
Some of these are a little extreme. Maybe its just me, but I wouldn't think twice about half the shit that goes on in these videos. I'd simply move on.
that truck at the start can move
can someone cut that stuff?
RIP clutch, @6:44
All the Riders in these vids are pussies .. just looking for trouble!  while on their super fast bikes -.- PUSSIES
I don't see the point in to start chaseing the truck ?????
7:00 Yamaha Dtr 125!! What I ride woo woo 👌
that first dude has more balls than I do I won't fuck with trucker they will gang up on you and they are way bigger than you lol
Several of these illustrate how bad bike riders behave. Enjoy your eventual road rash.
Almost everyone in this video should quit riding immediately.
A lot of these video's should be called Stupid, Crazy & Angry People Vs everyone else on the road
Kids on bikes with anger issues
I love how these loser motorcycle driver narrate how they back out of fights... u were never going to fight.
MANY BIKERS WILL SAY BAD WORDS AND BIKER WILL RUN LIKE DOG
First dudes a bitch. All that pull over shit and then runs when he does.
fuck you bikers tell him to stop so he does you chicken out then like a bitch look for a license plate like you don't bend yours up to not be read. tea pot calling the kettle black..... chump
From a road safety point of view, i think a lot of these bike riders need a re-test, & go looking for an argument !!
so this is all the idiot drivers in the world? i drive a bike myself and would nevef react like these guys. they are the ones instigating all their own shit
so you try to pull him over for a fight, he pulls over then u ride off???
I would love to run into one of you dickheads! I'd run your ass over then I'd shove that Go Pro down your throat you piece of shit!
Yo the first clip is near Fresno I can tell by the water park that's lit I live there 😂
That's in Fresno I know that because of the water park I used to go there a lot
Then he throws gallon of water out his window we both know m8 that was pish
Biker looks for plate on back of the Kenworth when Semis aren't needed to have one on the back lol
First of semis have front license plates not rear ones , second that was a piss jug not a water bottle 😂😂😂
3:38 theres no possible way he threw a gallon of water i didnt see any water but if there was then whoops
an idiot on a bike.
what a dick.  playing with the truck. right or wrong he should just let it go. why keep on? the truck pulled over. he shit his pants. then wants to take licence plate... another punk with a camera
Any biker that points and says "pull over bitch and fight" runs away like a coward because they know they would lose.
Some bikers are like small annoying wasps on the road
Third video I think it is, is definitely the bikers's fault
The first guy is dumber than a box of rocks
The dude in the first video is straight pussy 😂 why tell somebody to pull over and fight , but wait until he stops and then dip out ? Straight bitch made lmfao
dude in first video is a straight up pussy.  don't ride a bike if you can't put back your word up ya fuckn loser
at 7:17 the driver had the right to honk at him because he was sitting next to the car, yet the driver still should have let him in.
i like the sound at the first one
im not saying i hate the the motorcyclist but trying to go against a truck is very dangerous...
What were you trying to accomplish? you are afraid to fight. you make other bikers look like pussies
I don't know why but the rapid moving hand gestures are the funniest thing to me.
on the first one the street biker probably kept going because he didn't want to get his ass wooped by a trucker
what i wouldve done is shot his tires and make a run for it
Was the truck driver driving for swift if they were that could explain all of this
(Entro) *WHADDA LOVELY DAY*
Rip my ears in the 1st clip :/
Be nice if they just cut the Audio for number one
You mean Stupid, Crazy & Angry Bikers vs People?
Also at 6:54 also is he so drunk that he doesn't let anyone else say that to him
At 6:42 why did he say that is he drunk!?!
That bitch had thought he was lowkey getting away (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Now I see what bikers go through.
The last one filming is the real piece of shit... You're far away, the guy in the car didn't even see you behind those cars and you could've shift lanes... The fuck...?
If this is all your driving you're just an asshole with anger problems who doesn't know he's wrong. Bad driver not drivers. a little driving etiquette won't kill you...
I hate to break it to you dude but I don't think that was a gallon of water. that was a trucker bomb. AKA trucker piss
The first biker seems to have some mental issues or be paranoid. He is the one who can't get over it.
I'm sorry but the last 2 videos were completely retarded
I recognized that highway and the water park on the right.  "is that Fresno?"  look at the top left of the screen and see 559.  "yeah that's Fresno"
bikers need an angry management class.
Most of these idiots with go pros think they are old bill.They over react and give bikers a bad name
Some of them are just unjustified madness... For exemple the last one could just not have see him, no need of giving the finger... Sometimes i just dont get it
To much sissybikers herer who try to provocate other peoples.
Is ur intro krieg from borderlands 2? its sounds so much like him
So any one notice that the bikers weren't obeying the law ether. Especially the guy on the enduro in the U.K.
i love watching these vids!! half the time its the biker making a damn fool out of themself
I like it how on the first clip the lorry thinks he can out run a sports bike lol😂😂😂😂
you can find one on my channel, Idiot Driver Near Miss
i like your channel and i want you to continue. but please do more clips instead of half of the video one clip to get the 10 minute mark ^^ would be appreciated
Truckers by law are suppose to stay on the left lane.  Is this video made in europe or something? dif lawS?
Fresno ca people truck car bike all the same idiot
this is all fake for view s
sorry but some of these bikers are at fault some think they are always in the right but they're not
fuckers on bikes think they could do anything
If you think this is Angry people, you should ride here in Colombia, not even close
the first chase was crazy!
Is that first clip in Fresno California
angry truck driver
truck plates are on thw front bumper not back. plus your the one fucking with him. you wanted him to pull over and he did and you ran like a bitch......
Did the first part really need to be that long?
Should have called it “BIKER VS BLUE TRUCK (HALF OF THE VIDEO) ＆ SOME OTHER STUFF”
Slow down and let the A hole pass ........  the best defense is to avoid the conflict.
100% of these : get the fuck over it
THAT WAS A WASTE OF 14 MINUTES OF LIFE !!!!
Would have it been so hard to have a narrator who knows anything about areoplanes and/ or this one in particular?
I Hate Donald Trump
I Hate you Trump because you are a murderer MOTHAFUCKER!!!!!! 😬😈😠
I Hate This Video!! AND I HATE YOU DONALD TRUMP 😈😈😈😬😬😠😠😠
That's MY President! God bless you sir! #Blacks4Trump!
The way president Trump enters and exits the plane is so graceful
GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP AND GOD BLESS AMERICA !  MAGA  !
THIS GUY IS MORE GOOFY THEN GOOFY ...
NUT JOB IN THE HOUSE ...
It is not Donald Trump's plane; it is we the people's. Thank you.
I love HIS admiration of our military ... He respects them so much where Obama faked it
You can mark my word that this is a ONE TERM PRESIDENT.
Let's let them wait for a bit before my make my grand entrance
Ian H. He has been lying from the get go. If you believe a Wall will be built between Mexico and the USA you will never see it in you lifetime.
Try walking in his shoes. He's really working hard for the American People in spite of all the misrepresentations by the lying media. He is not a lying politician.
He made everyone wait soooo long after the plane landed...why?
where the TV verison ep 23

OMG Barry's face!  "Like I told you from the beginning, I am the future flash"
It was a perfect scene delivery. Though, I would have chosen a better place than a street for a reveal like that
We thought savitar said:I am the future,Barry. While actually he said:I'm the future Barry!!
Savitar is so fast he needs the suit damnn😏😜
Wtf why would Barry kill Iris and WHY would he turn evil
This was such a powerful moment. Look at how things change.
Yo what is Savitar is a version of Barry who did not create Flashpoint, and he is mad at this Barry for saving his mother and creating flashpoint? That makes sense
Can someone plz tell me why Barry would kill iris
You either die a hero, or live long enough to become the villan
I would have prefered him to be Wally, would make more sense and would explain why wally is that shocked...
I love savitar but I wanna know why future Barry wants to kill Iris 🤔maby to trick Barry so he will not know
How and Why ? I've missed many episodes I guess
Thanks for spoiling the episode by putting it in the title and thumbnail you dick head, for that yondu dies at the end of guardians of the galaxy (it's been released for a while where I live)
Remember in 2x21 when the Speed Force reprimanded Barry trying to change the timeline ? What if this Barry was a punishment for creating Flashpoint ?
I was hoping Savitar was one of the Power Rangers bad guys.
its like obito all over again
2:34 looks like ronnie
anyone know the soundtrack music in this video ?
Anyone know what episode he told barry he was the future flash?
The flash isn't on netflix?
Wait so Barry caused his own pain that turned him into Savitar? I hate time travel.
How many times can I say I told you so
Completely irrelevant, the actor who played Wally West is in Dance Academy
wow it's so hard to imagine Barry as an evil guy.
Thanks for the spoiler.
I love how sinister savitar looks, he reminds me of the guy who became the green goblin in the amazing spider man with electro and idk but he really does I love it
Who else has seen this for the thousandth time
He looks like that zuko character from avatar
like i told u i am the future BATMAN
i got spoiled thx
Did anyone notice the side of  Barry's face it gave me the goosebumps
some explain me, I don't get it, this is Barry from 2024? other people said savitar is a time remanent.
Wow!!! Spoiler in Title of this video. Thanks for broken my surprise and reaction.
Goooseeebumps
Am I the only one curious about savitar looks alike, tobey maguire when play peter as black spidey😂😂 the hair, the outfits 😂😂 SAME
Killer Frost is helping the flash, she told him who savitar is...
Why I got pissed off when he revealed himself?
I liked this reveal and all those small clues. I just wished this happened earlier this season, episode 14 or something. It would give more time to explore future Barry's backstory and motivation.
I love how everyone is screaming ''I told you so'' about Savitar being future Barry like it was some sort of amazing deduction in the first place lol.
So he DID become the fastest man alive!
worth waiting to see who is savitar is.......   best episode till date in this  season
Barry killed his own wife
So predictable, just like arrow
thanks for putting up videos with spoilers in the title the day after the episode airs you dense cunt
WHY DID HE KILL IRIS THEN?????
this was the dumbest thing they've ever done
Fucking retards, don't post the seasons biggest reveal on your channel, and if you do, don't say what the twist is about. It's disrespectful to those that haven't seen it 😳
I was shocked when I found out
but why isnt he taller.emo barry was taller...
Holy shit, I need that Flash/Savitar theme music
makes sense
this is pretty cool... hope to see season 4 without Savitar in it.... GO TEAM FLASH
did you have to put it in the title and the thumbnail f u
So all the time he hasn't been saying "I am the future, Flash",  but "I am the Future-Flash" ?
i love that scar that Savitar Barry has it makes him look badass
I think that savitar is the blue flash because in the comics he goes back to fix things and ends up killing his younger self and others he loved
FUCK THIS CHANNEL AND ITS STUPID ASS THUMBNAIL AND VIDEO TITLE THAT SPOILED THE EPISODE FOR ME!!!!!!!
"Like I told you from the beginning, I am not HR, Eddie Thawne, Ronnie Raymond, or Dante Ramon, I am the Future Flash" *music sounds*
asshole move to put spoilers in the thumbnail and title lile seriously some of us had to wait a day to watch because we have jobs thanks asshats
savitar story is combined with the one of future  flash...  savitar isnt barry in comics and neither is he blue....   but future flash is...!!
3x2 revers flash to Barry "Now who's the villain flash! now who's the villain
It's about time
so does this mean barry's immortal? I mean he barely ages at all.
Don't worry flash your suit needs the window's 10 update to be like savitar's
I want to see savitar Barry talk to zoom and reverse flash and he go like was up SLOW POKE
What happened to Barry's face
I would like to let you know its fucked up to spoil a whole damn season in the title 1 damn day after the episode aired... I appreciate that. Lol
Cisco: Barry do you love yourself? Barry: I'm not going to answer that!
Really? you put that on the title? what if someone have not seen that episode yet? ffs think before act!!!
That stuff on his face is the scars of the burns he got from running with that speed.
see this is the important use of commas. i am the future, flash and i am the future flash
Nice video title - I taped it and was going to watch the episode tonight. Can't even ignore it as it's on my YouTube home page. Thanks for spoiling everything.
Since When Was Freddy Krueger In The Flash. Literally
oh hell noo
Idk why but Savitar (barry) looks like ghetto ass freddy krueger....😂😂😂
Now Barry, YOU ARE THE VILLAIN!
I KNEW IT AND CALLED IT! I knew it was gonna be Future Flash, Who else Would it Be?
Fuck you for spoiling this!!! also i paused the video so it doesnt count as a view
The video on my channel will make your day guaranteed laugh.
why am I watching this.. I'm a Pokemon.
Who came here because It was #1 Trending
I don't know, but something about this story seems flawed and fabricated.
Omg thats cray
that's a good one alright
that kid is a legend
Graham Norton is my spirit animal "Does talking to them not drive you insane?" "No, I love it too much" "...Okay, Orla"
The main botty boy Graham.
Amy Schumer will probably steal that
well...he's not wrong.....
what was the name of the town or state she said on the red chair? i need to look it up and read if it's really true.
well I mean, he ain't wrong😏
i'm sure it's a fake story, no teacher will tell 5-6 y.o children that PNG is known for cannibalism let alone trying to explain the concept of cannibalism to them.
Give it a while and Amy Schumer will steal that joke too.
Watch now as Amy steals her joke and makes it worse
Orla > Amy Schumer
Wow, I live in Ireland.
Watch out Orla, Amh shumar is provably gonna steal that joke
adf. ly/1mQ7ao
Meanwhile in America, their children couldn't find their own country on a map. .
Don't you hate it when the title of the video spoils the punchline?
oh my God that's hilarious look at the size of Amy Schumer what a heifer
Next week little Jimmy will bring in his half eaten sister for show and tell
"See Amy? THAT'S comedy...."
I'm a simple man; I see Amy Schumer, I hit dislike.
Why is this numero uno on trending
irish people are hilarious
Amy Schumer is a fat disgusting pig!
FINALLY A GOOD NON AWKWARD STORY
😆type 111 after u subbed me for a sub # I have a live count for my subs
Amy looked HORRIBLE
I'd hate if my six year olds teacher was teaching the class about cannibalism! What an irrelevant, inappropriate and disturbing topic for the teacher to discuss with her class.
Kinda... Kinda ruined it with that title.
Would have been funnier if the title hadn't spoiled it.
individual I guess  truly  hanhsome$  advance  :)
That kid will go far in life!!
And in that moment we all knew... Amy is gonna steal that joke.
I needed subtitles, but listened to it a second time and i got it.  Good one.
Give that kid a medal
smart kid, he can read between the lines.
I'm glad a 6 year know about lesbians but it shocking that he know "that"  nsfw part human eating human, we know what they're eating at.
They DON'T eat humans in Papau New Guinea. if teach your pupils that, you bloody misinforming them
I hope she was joking when saying people in Papua new guinea are cannibals, thats completely false
At first I thought it read; "Cannabis and lesbians". Either way, I wanted to hear more!!
Help - I have a 7 page paper due tonight and I'm trapped in a Graham Norton wormhole
I saw the title, I click
"Hey kids, did you know Papa New Guinea is famous for eating people? Does anyone know what we call a human who eats another human?".  That is one messed up primary school teacher!
Finally a good funny story with good delivery that doesn't involve crapping themselves or puking on a grandma or smthg
To me the bigger part of that story was that the teacher was teaching a room of 5/6 year olds what cannibalism is 😨😨
Random person tells a funny story in 1:30 min better than Amy does an entire Netflix show.
next time amy is on this show she will need a couch of her own.
THAT NEVER HAPPENED!
Great story, but you have to ask why we are teaching 6 year olds about cannibalism? Lol
Any butthurt citizens of Papua New Guinea in the comments section?
Guess they forgot to add text or some kind of outro card to the end of this vid?lol
Is it just me, or does the irish accent really sound that sexy?
wait... why they didn't ask her how did he know that?😵
Is it just me or is cannibalism a bit heavy topic for five to six year olds...
this story makes me horrified and sad...what are children learning!
the kid's not wrong, the do eat each other
technically .....
Had to turn up the volume for this one
I thought they were called Cannibals
that's an awkwardly well informed 6 years old kid right there
Her shirt matches the couch
He isn't wrong, is he XD
Schumer will steal that story.
Anyone putting what order they came in the comments are tragic
Kid isn't wrong.
I bet her got some weird spelling like Saoirse
well in fairness, we kinda do eat people...out
came third :D
Real or fake....?
Real or fake....?
I guess she got sick of hearing cheesy wedding vows *cough* lies *cough* that they will break in 15 years when they are bored of each other.
looool nooo wayyy that's hilarious!!!
that's some season of abundance
Something is wrong with this people. Why she didn't stopped talking? What type of person just ignores that and continues to talk?
I was a little confused at the title, never heard that as a different puking term.
i can smell it
Wtf! I would have at least walked of to the side so I'm not right in front of the bride and groom while vomiting
she sure hates sharing. she is banging the groom and the thought of them two sharing him just made her puke.
Hahaha that's what you get for getting a bitch to do a mans job LMFAOOOO she will remember that for ever!
ahh Women ministers. i just love them
"I promise not to eat you..."
I thought they didnt allow porn on youtube
It's funnier the 15th time.
0:09 hahahahah
its their family tradition, that why the braid didnt react, its all good guys dont worry
What a great run through memory lane.
Step 1 read my username... Step 2 read step 1 again. Repeat as necessary.
The bride's speech was so nauseating the minister couldn't help herself.
At least she turned and didn't get it on the bride.
"i promise to be your biggest advocate and your best friend"  that minister could literally smell the bullshit coming out her mouth.
HAHAHAHAHAHA
Pregnant?   surely not by the groom...
Yellow rain,  some stay dry and others feel the pain.
Did she Fuke? Or is it Purt?
The second time watching it you can really see the world of hurt she's in before spewing hahaha.
I was so excited to hear her shit herself, but that's just the force of the vomit/air breaching her mouth. Still good tho!
Who WOULDN'T puke when looking at that fat bitch?
I bet she had to vomit while listening to that fat cow....
wanna bet she was at the bachelorette party?
What a nasty woman
That bitch just kept talking...wtf?
Offtopic: The woman holding the flowers is gorgeous. I'm in love.
And the morbidly obeast "bride" just keeps talking like the minister didn't just puke? There's a gal I'd want to marry!
Bridesmaid: Can I offer you a bouquet in this trying time?
I was hoping *'Chunks'* was the best man!
Found my new ringtone
The more I watch it, the funnier it gets LMFAO
Slightly off topic, but does anyone know if reddit.com is a fun website to visit?
If I was having to marry a fat cow like that I'd throw up too.
wow the one holding the flowers is a bombshell
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
This is disgusting. If I'm paying a camera man the insane costs to film my wedding I want him to at least face track the person who is ruining my wedding by vomiting at the forefront.
LMAOOOOOOOOOOO
Did she shit herself?
I love the fart sound that preceeds the vomit. Ahh the simple things.
Lol they will always remember this part
my thoughts exactly
hahahahahahaha

14:24 That jump scare!!! I got such a fright!!!
Thes boy attac on basel and ali in clash royal
your the bestyoutuber
Which of these movies are you looking forward to most?
YESSSSSSS LOBOOOOOOOO how didn't i know about this earlier? why am i most hyped about this one? and gotham sirens
If I was a director I would make a justice League trilogy reboot with these members superman batman, flash, green ladern, Martian manhunter, hauckgirl wonder woman and villains as secret society, amazo,and darkseid
I heard Shazam was canned
Teen titans is not in the plan.They already burned cyborg and slade.Batman movie should have the Dick Grayson as Robin and finally the human bat as villain.
"Just don't make the suit green, or animated!" -Wade Wilson Sorry Wade, but it's going to happen again.
That Batman film needs Red Hood
justice league war and superman vs elite was one of the best animated movie of dc so i love to see them on big screen one day.
bruh, rock is cooking
Super hero movies are so so so so so overplayed and boring. Why not just come up with something original with actual good dialogue
if they don't get JL right they should quit making DC movies.
once these movies come out dc will have the upper hand in the movies considering that they are making movies for villians and not just superheroes unlike marvel
I hope Idris Elba will be chosen for John Stewart
I just hope at least one of them will have some color on screen.
So which one was supposed to blow my mind?  So far the DC movies has been crap, of all these only Lobo & The Batman is anything that I even remotely look forwards to
Batgirl is already confirmed with Josh Whedon as instructor.
seriously ? tired of seeing the rock , he's in way too many movies , give someone new with the role 😠
I want to see a teen titans movie
they need to make a Martian Manhunter movie
lol give the main man a movie
I'm Super Sad That Ezra Miller is playing Flash that is a big reason that makes me hate the movie.
Is it me or does the new flash suit suck and make Ezra miller look like a woman
can't wait to see cyborg solo film as for shazam why is that even a character any more.
You guys forgot the Batgirl movie and the Nightwing movie! Those are also upcoming movies in the DCEU! Avengers Director, Joss Whedon is going to be directing Batgirl!
you forgot to mention Joss Whedon's "Batgirl"
movies that are going to blow every one away - "we heard it's a disaster. we are hoping that it's not". yeah good reason to think it's going to blow everyone away
you forget about Nightwing
Regarding the Flash-it wont work on the big screen because they're doing the same stupid thing that Smallville did with Superman. The guy who plays the Flash now is way better than the brooder who's been shown on BvsS.
Until they get rid of Zach Snyder and figure out how to make a decent DC movie, these will all suck
hey..dude... can I copy your assignment? "sure mate just change a little bit.."
will smith is bigger than affleck
The less Ben the better
marvel puts hulk in films with the other because paramount owns the rights to solo hulk movies dc has all there characters
barry is much more faster
Black Adam not bald actually
Get Adam Copeland (Edge) to play Lobo...he is perfect for that character
DC's got some cool stuff..... but Marvel is just better.
So many Marvel dick suckers in comments section  haha fuck off
I can't remember the last time I hated a movie as much as Suicide Squad. Oh, wait, yes I can - Batman v Superman...
Someday Deathstroke will get his own movie. Someday...
The movie's action and cgi scenes are spot on good, they just make shitty scripts and terrible story telling for their movies, its such a shame because i want dc to rival marvel.
i want Ryan Reynolds to play the new green lantern considering he played both versions of dead-pool redeeming the characters movie appearance, i want him to do the same to Hal Jordan
Dc.... Falling faster than Marvel is making boxoffice.
Justice League might be worth watching, and it might not. However, the two that I actually want to see is The Flash and Black Adam.
They should have Keanu Reeves as John Constantine again.
Jason momo is LOBO hes ok as aqua man but if they kill him off in the sequel it will add emotional depth and then he can return as lobo the role he was born to play.
DC shitshow will bankrupt WB.
dc should make a league of assasins tv series. Along with a batman family series
Ben Affleck is Batman but Christian bale is always dark knight....
i still wonder why warner bros doesn't come up with batman's sons aka the robins tho... they could be the goofing off part to compete with marvel's
Wonder Woman is gonna save DC
I'm only interested in the flash
yet there is still no grant gustin flash in a movie...
Why not use the T.V. flash character and put HIM on screen instead?
Looper, your music choice is repetitive, annoying, and is the same in every video. Please change this.
Can't find Cyborg on IMDB. :( or Dark Universe or Lobo
Wasn't the shazam movie scrapped due to script issues?And John Stewart is not a fan favorite in the comics. He virtually has zero story. He is only famous because of the Justice League animation.
am i the ONLY one that rolled their eyes when he said man of steel 2 rofl
All of these movies will be horrible. DC sucks
wonder woman looks really good can't wait to see it I think they should bring hawkman and hawkgirl in to it
Thumbnail says these movies will blow everyone. Is this guaranteed? Because I'll pre-purchase tickets right now. I'd just rather be first in line.
this is going to be a awesome movies
ehhh we shal see, it almost impossible to surpas The Dark Knight or the whole Nolen trilogy for that matter.
In comics I prefer DC Over Marvel, however when it comes to movies, Marvel is crushing DC Like 1,000,000 times over. DC Movies have been a disaster after The Dark Knight trilogy
will smith is hot and famous but i dont like him as deadshot
I dont know why but I feel uncomfortable with Ezra Miller as Flash. I prefer Grant Gustin...
...not! lol
Pardon my french but as much as I love DC they need to get their shit together and blow people away with epic movies!!!
It all sounds great... except for the Lobo idea.
I HATE when they call him Shazam...  His name was, is and always will be Captain Marvel!!!!
Anybody else worried about a Deadshot movie with Will Smith being in his early-mid 50's by the time it actually rolls around?
I hope in suicide squad we get characters like killer frost and if we do get killer frost is played by Danielle Panabaker
Red Hood would have probably saved DC....easily
so who do you want to play Billy in Shazam
Non of these movies blew my mind
They should use one of the kids from stranger things
The Constantine TV show was so good, I really hope it comes back
we want arrow
John Cena would be perfect actor for Shazam.
Ok let's be honest.. Marvel blows DC outta the fucking water in every way.
9:57 Ahhh... Twilight Lobo.
4K Grafik... Megaa

I got a potato on Google images (when searching gaming console)  by using Reddit
Look at r/funny and r/comics to find prime examples.
I actually reached Top #1 on reddit. once... easy peasy. Wish I got payed for it.
very interesting
If Reddit is the 11th popular in America I'm guessing pornhub is 1st
how can this be fixed though? cause its a failure in the base of reddit?!!?!?
unfortunately so many top comments there are shit irrelevant jokes having very little to do with the OP.
R/politics is a ugly place. It's headline porn
Reddit is so ridiculously stupid. Its just a hotbed for trolls and censorship. No wonder it attracts so many dumb people.
i'll take 1 strong with a side of more strong pls
Real LPT is always in the comments!
why the fuck are you buying account syou can make for free?
Getting fame by spending money? Looks like many people don't know shit about how the rap game came up ;)
Wow, I'm flabbergasted.  I thought investigative journalism was long dead.  Well done.
proof of CTR (shariablue) and hillshills.
This helps to explain why Reddit politics is so poor.
so people follow the herd mentality and don't read, not surprising
"people  argue that reddit is just a website"  no they dont.
aka fake news
I came here from reddit
I though I was the only one. Reddit was so nice to begin with. It feels empty lately.
Extremely interesting research. Thank you.  The answer is damn simple. They need to remove the voting system. I've been saying that for years.
I do think media needs to take more of a response to the none read articles of headlines, too many headlines are out of place with the content. I do think this should be a factor within this.
reddit is currently the #5 social media site in the world
Getting your news by reading Reddit headlines--well THAT obviously makes you a well-informed induhvidual!  Sheesh.
"one small nug" top kek
check out my fcartoons! some of them are now and some are old
If you had to click on the link posted before voting on it, reddit would instantly improve.
the guy selling reddit accounts @ 4:00 says "straws" not "strongs"
Great and informative video....very good experiment!
Of course it can be bought - especially on the big subreddits. This shouldn't discount Reddit though. Some smaller, niche reddits can be very helpful and informative.
On that note, why in the heck do people believe everything they read? I like to verify or see things for myself.
Russian trolls everywhere.
Who cares. Im no reddit fag.
Pretty obvious to anyone familiar with r/politics or r/t_d. Its a huge sham
It's so weird seeing all these Reddit references in the Youtube comments section.
bots came out for this one
How long was the period you gave Reddit to respond?
DV the spammers? I thought DV was for knee-jerk reactions vs my confirmation bias.
Iran and Russia have a huge propaganda in the site against the usa and some stupid American believe what they say
very hand horizon city Japanese comment employ museum fade.
People who down voted are probably redits staff .. Or maybe they keep oompaloompas
Did I watch this video from reddit because you bought upvotes ?
CTR figured this shit out more than a year ago
i just realized how we will save out future generation thank me later america,
5:45 Tbh, most people just read the comments, you get the main theme of the article without having to read it, and usually commentors point out fallacies and truths
Reddit helped bernie, bernie stole votes from clinton, clinton lost to trump, therefore reddit created Trump
Reddit is for fags
I think they just tried to game me into reading an entire Forbe's article!
one of the scummiest companies on earth, the CEO is a total piece of shit who censors anything that doesn't fit the narrative of whoever filled his pockets this week
Save us God Emperor Trump
if yoo want to poost in noose subreditt, you need more stronk
Nice advice and offer
swag good video shame more people don't truly know this
One way to distinguish this news is fake or not. Aliens.
+1 if you are here from reddit
The Liberals and SJW are actually doing the work for our Emperor Trump. Just Imagine, Trump using their technology and Algorithm to suppress liberal and democrat's speech. Oh yeah !
Just like everything else great in the world, the capitalists find a way to fuck it all up for everyone.
wow great now everyone has the scape goat they wanted for why [insert person or event here]  happened or did not happen on reddit
So this is how these Trumpian supporters get their facts for pizzagate (fake) "news". Hmmm, interesting.
When will this 100% façade ever end? EVERYTHING IS FAKE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH
please guys someone tell me where i can buy some reddit accounts ?? cheap like this guys ??
its the content that matters. not the votes.
lol. Spez needs to step his ass down, but nope this shit has been going on for years.
their system is more like. Upvote fake trendy news, downvote anything that doesn't fit the popular agenda.  upvote stupid joke comments downvote any opinions that aren't cookie cutter
I'm simply not interested in your opinion
Same thing with YouTube comments... everything on the internet is manipulatable if you want to put in the effort.
So you're saying that I have the power to skew news with a few lines of python using the Reddit API and textblob(to upvote/downvote negative/positive comments using sentiment analysis.
how much did all the likes on this video cost you guys?
Phil, you must do some audiobooks, your voice makes me calm and happy. #NoHomo
ha! if you go to that fake UK posting people were shitting all over the article for its errors and calling it out to be fake at the time.
Dude figured out how to be a Karma Whore on Reddit. Congladurations, you've blown the top off this story kiddo! See you in the big leagues buster!
Reddit is a fucking joke
And this is why a healthy dose of skepticism is helpful. Just don't overdo it, right?
NO ... Can it be? Black DDK :O 5:34
No wonder Russia is so popular on worldnews
WE DID IT REDDIT!
MESSAGE FROM QATAR TO JANET: WE WANT OUT MONEY BACK!!!
she is a gold digger bitch. But to be fair I would want that 500 mil too . that would set me up for life
shut your mouth butch
divorcing from a billionaire after having a baby lol we all know why $$$$
Please come to San Diego<3!
They are middle age ,but still talk like typical siblings.  So cute.  "stop making fun of your sister weight Randy"
Top scammer

She's so sweet!
Missin Michael a lot after this
CONGRATULATIONS Janet on the birth of your BEAUTIFUL baby girl<3!  May God bless you both, may she bring you many, many years of love and joy<3!  Lots of love and hugs<3.
Wow, Randy is an asshole.
I bet all the siblings sound really similar cos her voice reminds me of MJ so much
Does she have issues with her nose too?
I am so happy for her. she is such a strong woman. love you Janet!
the wrong jackson died. go to hell you gold-digging baby talking waste of space.
Janet sounds more like Micheal than he ever did,congrats on the baby and glad your happy
Shut the fuck up. Entitled, rich bitch. Fuck you and your baby.
hopefully your baby doesn't see past Superbowls
No worries honey... the weight will drop off, and you'll always have your precious child! ♡ God's got your back. All the best with the tour, love and prayers.
Janet. J. what  Woman X peace
What's wrong with your faaaace?
Please be quiet randy thank you 🤐😆😆😆😆😆😆😂that's was funny 😂
Looks like she ate the Jackson 5...well technically she probably ate 3 of them.
finesse Queen of the year
We all go through things in life....yes, even superstars. Good to see her coming back. She sounds so much like Michael (a little eerie).
She's a fuckin gold digger. Got separated with her husband the moment she could get as much as possible out of him.
"Now I ain't saying she's a gold digger..."
who's gonna take care of that baby you love so much while your on Tour ?
kill yourself Janet
tanned Philippino chick lol plop she is
im so fat i better lay down to take this picture
i wish people where smarter i hate sharing this world with this gross amount of money
i was 100% sure they will divorce someday. wasn't obvious ? i mean we all know what divorce get you over there
she sucks is she even relevant.thats all they do is have a. baby with billionares selma hayek is another gold digger.life is so easy only so many days u can lay around and do nothing all day lay down miss irrelevant
Janet, please! come to Spain!! 💕
she finessed that dude for so much cash
Divorce laws favoring women are discriminatory and should be revised.
she is out of date
Look at these crazy Madonna stans who voted down on this video. They claim their fave is so great, yet they spend their time trolling Janet Jackson. Pay attention to your fave if you think she's so great.
She has that be quite money.
She kinda sounds like Charlie the Unicorn.
Damn Janet, you still looking good after all these years.
what fans bro
If it's in court it's not in 'Gods' hands it's in the lawyers hands surely?
Very rude the way you spoke to Randy ... Always a bitch ...
Please go back into retirement. No one wants this.
It's the pleasure principal. Lol
Bruh what if this is Michael in disguise
Bruh, she sounds so much like Michael
You sound like Michael.
Janet has such a soothing voice. We love you Penny!!! 😌
Spoken like a true Synagogue of Satan Zionist Jew puppet.
The biggest marriage scam of all time. $500,000,000 about to be in her bank account.
that voice reminds me of someone i miss very much
So @janet now you're ain't muslim anymore? You know in Islam there is no such as thing call prenup
What a fat fuckin cow! Back to your hole
"More than a few" 😂 Randy crazy
Sounds like MJ
Thought you were a Muslim?
State of world = politics for you  (so it is lol)
52?!? She looks like a teenager, I bet she's drinking her son's blood.
Fuck you  bitch thief
I love you Janet! Life love and health be with you. I had a crush on you ever since good times!  Congratulations to your new born son! Have a safe tour. Forever your Fan Gina!   💯😎
There's a difference between hustling/grinding to get your money and getting money by scamming people #janthescammer #foh
Miss u Janet!!! From One of your biggest FANS, of course!!! Still playing NO SLEEP, I love that song ✋
Thank you Janet for keeping it real. You are amazing have always been and will always be. Enjoy motherhood and this new journey your fans cannot wait to see you on your tour

Janet is still beautiful

Not sure that the brands the women have gone to is the right brand for them eg charlotte
I use to think this was real 😂😂😂😂
carmella  is crazy
They building towards Charlotte vs. Natalya at Summerslam?
Nataylia is big pig
you all know it's fake right?
why aj Lee is left wwe
Many may hate Charlotte, but she is the best diva of her generation.
The moment when Tamina forget that she teamed up with Naomi #Team_Bad 😉
I'll miss Mickie, but getting rid of the toxic was worth it.. If Carmella can improve and show she can hang with the other 4 (tamina is...) the division will be better than the 2014 nxt women's division
Ladies, ladies, no need go fight. There's enough of me for all of you
The women's division is the best thing on Smackdown Live right now.
There's No Captain On There Team That's Why They Carmella Song
WWE please tone down your RACISM and let Naomi have a Long Title reign PLEASE she is an All round Great Woman Wrestler Stop with the White Power
Natalya Stabbed Becky In Back So Many Times Too At Money In Bank And In Tag Team Match Too That's Why She Did What She Did
Lol fake as fook seen less coriography at a Michael Jackson show
I Can't See Naomi as a Champ... Tamina is Never Been a Champ , She Deserves to Be a Champion
and then they hug, are they ok?
so fricking messed up, how could they possibly do that to eachother
I'd eat Carmella all day... and all night... til tomorrow morning.
carmella is like the add one out of the three.😂😂
Charlotte flair has big shows legs
I like the heelssssa
Is tamina heel or face???
Smackdown & RAW Are "Sucks" nothink now Without : Nikki Bella / aksana & more ..
Charollete face?
wow this wwe vidoe is #11 trending vidoe
Charlotte should go to raw !
You know your over rated when you get pinned & lose to my  #BubbleGumPrincess  Carmella  #HaveANiceDay
Charlotte is best than all  .  She is queen.
Sister Abigail >  Smackdown divas
I don't like naomi as a heel it was better was face
This is Awesome
please fire Natalia she sucks
Where's nikki bella
Why did Tamina attacked Naomi, I thought they were friends??
James ellsworth is freaking bad i mean...he acts liked that but hus weak wtf my dad can 1v1 you you freak your not even strong
Go to 0:40, how Natalya (how u spell it) glide on the ring?
Natalya is such a terrible heel. She needs to learn something from charlotte or carmela.
Y'all know these ladies are friends when the curtain drops, right?
I have the shoes that Ellsworth had
naomi had her reign now it's time for an actual woman wrestler to get that title.
I wish they can use chairs but now is pg😧
Is this gonna be another PCB vs BAD...🤔
carmella is just an aj.lee wannabe
They will get theirs
Smackdown Women Division > Raw Women Division
I want to hug Becky
smackdown women's division is better
that state island squad just need brazzers not wwe
Elsworth is so weak we could all take him down
I wonder if this means that Charlotte is turning face. I would really like to see that.
Look how far Naomi has come as a wrestler. With just a little more mic work, she could be one of the best to ever do it   #FeelTheGlow #NaoMob #HolyTrinity
They should make an, I don't know how to name it... a "Legacy" match? Between Natalya (Nephew of Bret Hart), Tamina (Daughter of Jimmy Snuka) and Charlotte (Daughter of Ric Flair :v) What do you think?
Carmella and Ellsworth are fresh😎
Carmella for women's championship ????
Announcer: She should have join them... like Durant did with the warriors Me: He did not!!😂
NATTIE SUCKS AND CARMELLA TOO SO HERE THIS    HEELS: NATALYA CARMELLA TAMINA EVA MARIE    FACE: NIKKI BELLA CHARLOTTE NAOMI BECKY LYNCH   AND IS THERE ANY OTHER WOMEN FROM SMACKDOWN WHO A HEEL OR A FACE.................
so is becky a heel or face
Shield Women 😂
Ellsworth gets a front row seat to watch women wrestle
Natalya,Tamina,and Carmella are bully's I hate bully's  so much!!!!!!
LOL Tamina and Naomi use to be a team and never turned on each other but now they're fighting 😂
Once nicki Bella returns that welcoming committee will be toast
Ellsworth started off as a joke, and he still is one. That's all he'll ever be. The fact that he is still in the WWE surprises me.
Ellsworth should join women wrestling
I am waiting to see tamina Carmella Natalya vs Charlotte Naomi Becky
BECKY ARE THE BEST
Lana Becky lynch Naomi and Charlotte vs Natalya Carmella Tamina and Ellsworth
Love Naomi but The Welcoming Committee is giving me life. I can't wait to see next week's Smackdown
James Ellsworth the new SmackDown Live Women's Champion!
Charlotte is a wimp on RAW. Charlotte is a master on SMACKDOWN. LIKE IF U AGREE!
I miss all the superstars that were in Smackdown.😭😰
tamina is so fat she cant fit in a tractor
I'm going to un subscribe if you guys keep on putting Carmella i will un subscribe but if you and kick her out  I'll bring all my friends to subscribe to you
Well Ellsworth just made the biggest mistake of his life since Ambrose moved to Raw there's no going back now
We need MORE female competitors. WWE needs to realize in order to keep the Women's division accerlation they need as many superstars as the men get not just for multi feuds but different charactets
2:23 when tamina broke up with Naomi
Becky's the real boss
i love becky face or heel
finally becky lynch does the right thing
This is Not Becky this is Aloy
So they got the shittiest wrestlers and turned them into a "welcoming committee"
Charlotte is saving SD
if you donate half of what you launder for the drug cartels, you could end world hunger Wells Fargo. Shame on you
I wrote an update in the description, if anyone is interested how this clip first became viral.
his wife was apparently using the toilet & that's how the kiddos had time to get into the room - if you look closely, her pants aren't all the way up!
It would reprise if it doesn't. ... xo
don't apologize for having a family.
typical WMAF family
Pause.. im just rewatched it the mother literally dragged the one in yellow on her side... she ran like she was going to get a beating from her husband for not watching the door. WTF!
not sure if wife or nany.. probably wife becuase the baby says something in Korean. but that wife was so freaked out she dragged the EFF out of those poor kids. omg image that important?
This is sexist as fuck. He should be in prison for holding such a misogynistic mind set.
The funniest thing I've seen since Donald Trump was elected President of the USA
love this family,
Don't Korea. :-)
Beautiful Family !!!  Stay happy forever, as always !!!
Anyone else feel like he's a careless/ bad father for not turning around? Also I seriously doubted she was the mom, she looks like a maid/ Nanny. I know I'm not the only one who thought this
I couldn't stop laughing, I loved this, it was so funny...
Life happens!
I lost it when the second baby came rolling in and then the mom this was great
This is hilarious!XD
>800 thumbs down?  maybe from trump people...
I have only one thing to say to this.   And that's:     LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
👍🏼👍🏼 Kudos for keeping focused through the commotion in the background
Lol the mom coming in like special forces
That was great! I needed this, this morning,lol. Wondering who's kids they were.
The respawn rate on these kids is out of control.
The second baby sealed the deal for me! The reporter was so close to losin it! XD
Love it. We need more of this....
Hahaha, I laughed to tear out at the first watching! 😂😂😂
love how she walks in like hey guys it's ME,! IT'S ME TIME IT'S ME!
People already started making parody of this
Why is this so offensive?
The wife's reaction is more dramatic than the kids TBH
I live for the baby's entrance.
That is his wife folks, not maid.
LOL the way she walks in, PARTY'S OVER BITCHES
Is that woman a Nanny or the Wife?
That's his wife lmfao. Look him up you racist dumb fucks
"OMG WHY DO PEOPLE SHE'S THE NANNY? RAAAAAAACIST!!!!!!"  stfu who cares? btw asian isn't a race so to stereotype that in the first place and to connect it to a racist comment is just false
she hit that corner fast as hell 😂
I like it when the wife comes in: matrix kung fu slide, grabs both kids and out>> Funny.
This comment section makes me lose faith in humanity. Can't we just enjoy the video? So what if she's the mum or nanny? IT'S NOT IMPORTANT FOR FUCKS SAKE!!
are his kids part Asian?  wtf is wrong with him?
LAUGHED SO HARD I CRIED!😂
Come on BBC, GIVE THIS DAD THE JOB !!!  HE TRULY DESERVES IT !!!
Look at the scared nanny. Robert Kelly is a racist abusing his children and their nanny.
The mom runs in as if there was an apocalypse going on XD
LOL he put hes hand on the kid like "STOP EXISTING PLEASE"
That little girl walked in like a BOSS. Literally zero fucks given.
Couldn't handle a real white woman dude? Instead you had to let your genetics get riced?
Couldn't handle a real white woman dude?
He should have locked the door before Broadcasting.
LOL HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
Attend to messege plz
The first girl just 2pac walked up in there.
That moment the dad tries to hand off the kid in the face gets me 😂😂😂😂
Still killing me. That has to be one of the most perfectly funny moments I've ever seen.
😂 I love how the lil girl enters the room
Fake news. )
Alic renovations
That nanny looks as illegal as she is funny.
Gosu fans will like this comment.
0:04 and then 0:21 LMAO
I hope they got the belt after the interview was over
I like that it cuts back to the studio briefly then they realize fuck it, this is much funnier
OMG, my husband and I are laughing so hard! Love it how she bursts in and grabs the kids, like ninja style! LOL
I SWEAR THIS IS STRAIGHT OUT OF A SITCOM
Yo maybe original video poster should, like, disable comments for this video
The moment when she close the door!!
This situation exposed this guy is a stuck up douche. Just laugh, make light of it and move on ya old fag.
This would only be more perfect if he got up with no pants on.
Hahhahah that was great
That's hilarious 😂😂😂
The mom had to straight pull off a Get Out challenge to pounce on her kids.
The kids are so cute
Seriously, the way she slides through the door at :20 like Cosmo Kramer . . . . ...priceless, truly an A-B moment.
Lol I remember when this video had only 215 views.
disgusting white pig
Hope he doesn't lose his job because of his kids! His kids and wife are so so awesome! hahaha
it was a pity children. they very roughly pushed
I bet he didn't stand up because he didn't wear pants

Make a roller coasters
I have seen kan show this
The thing turns to make a sensor so, when the driver is about to hit something the senors in the big box will light up so, he knows when to turn.
that 'new Ferrari' is a FXX just saying
That gigantic screen is a radar so you can dive it. Btw KAN has a super cool youtube Channel so sue to him

they should make rc things a reality, like make a controller where it would follow the vehicle while driving the command center!
your joking right? the best kind of kid is the quiet kind xD, I have no room to speak cause I'm the noisiest kid ever
luap and durfs golf course
Squid it turns so it can sense things it's made by kan gaming and the turning is for the radar so when something is near is spears on the controllers radar screen

Try building a teleported!

Just saying but your mum's a bit of a dickhead. She parked in the family parking space even though she was by herself. I mean c'mon just find a normal space and have a little walk
0:34seconds you can see his dad has an e-cig.

DEJI FAMILY
The best prank pulled in this video is between you and your barber fam
Larry is real.
can definitely hear the inspiration from san cisco/ bastille etc those bands he listens to it comes out so much more in this song
this calls for a poptart
This is such a blatant rip off of blackbird! Same key, same notes, same fingering, just moved around a tiny bit. Embarrassing!
Thought this was blackbird by the Beatles when it first started😂😂
Larry is real
I admit that when he screamed, I got an orgasm Only Harry can do that.
you are the best person in all over the world 😭❤
Brilliant!!!
i get a brandi carlile vibe and i love it
Did anyone else get a Blackbird vibe from the beginning of the song?
This song is so good except for when he shouts "sweet creature" multiple times. Ruins it tbh. Still really good though ❤️
One Direction: "Take me home" Harry Styles: "You take me home"
so good!! <3
Rly good song Harry but i rly dont care how your back looks
bro i don't even have to tell you anything you know.💖💖💖💖
he is my sweet baby if yaa think that too  say sweet baby
Feels!!! ❤️ proud of u Harry Styles... :') you've come a long way around!! Proud of u man!! ❤️❤️
different! you make feel when I listen to your songs like I live in another planet. .. another world ..... my world!
Lyrics is so beautiful. This is art
The guitar sound gave me beatles vibes😍❤
harry i love it the song is so cute and the tune is amazing congrats great work ❤
THE SCREAM AT 2:26 GETS ME EVERYTIME I FEEL THE EMOTIONS AND POWER FROM IT
I love you so much Harry
Reminds me of black bird by the Beatles :) I love this
THE MUSIC, HIS VOICE, THE LYRICS, EVERYTHING GOES TOGETHER SO WELL MAKING SUCH A CALM SONG THAT BECAME MY FAVORITE IN THE VERY FIRST PLAY
THE BEST WAY TO LISTEN THIS SONG IS TO LAY IN THE GRASS IN THE SILENT ENVIRONMENT BY LOOKING AT THE SKY AND THINKING ABOUT HARRY STYLES😍😍😍 sorry for my english
You Bring me home.
lovely song
sounded like "blackbird" in the beginning :)
This music is so beautiful, honestly. It's Harry's world and he's such a wonderful artist. Hope the best for you xxx
Did I save this song or did this song saved me
I'm not even a pop fan and I'm already in love with this album
I like this more than sign of the times 😍
ME ENCANTO ME ENCANTO ME ENCANTO
check this http://bluenik.com/sou
This reminds me of blackbird ( by the beatles ) so much . Love the song <3
DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THAT DROP OF WATER ROLLING DOWN HIS BACK!!!!!!!
I don't like this one
do you see this DROP dripping down his BACK so slowwwwwly? mesmerizing
who cares who this is about? lets just enjoy the song!!!
Sign of the times, Sweet creature, Slow hands.......     Best plan to kill a girl.😍
I just noticed that one drop of water moving down his body repeatedly and the pink water is moving too! 😳😍👏🏻
This would have been a perfect song to put into 13 reasons why
Beautiful <3
this makes me cry so hard, im so so so so proud of him. such beautiful songs.
"What do ya do Harry"  "Um.. I work in a bakery"  NOT ANYMORE FUCK . He's come so far I'm drowning in my own tears.
harry not beautif he is perfect
He is the best among the boys😘😘😘
This has just ruined all of his fame
HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO HANDLE THIS. I CANT. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. OMG YASS HARRY
Man who's this Don Thrilla guy?
somehow when he just starts singing at the start it reminds me of olivia
Harry Styles: the best voice of One Direction
OH i love this so much. cant stop listening :)

Jimmy you have made my life and so many others lives better. I wish all the best to you beautiful family.
im happy that the baby is being taken care of and all seems well.  now if only everyone could get the prompt and immediate care that a millionaire celebrity got, that would really be something
Touching until he went into the Argument from Pity fallacy.
My brother lost his first baby girl due to some kind of hole in her heart. She got to be 2 months before she passed. It's really sad when that stuff happens.
6:04 is that ant? from fighttips haha
I have ToF and am so happy that this video is getting the attention it deserves!
I am sorry that you had to deal will this
Yes, we agree, but people who truly run this country probably never will.
Bless you Jimmy.
I subscribed because of this video
Well said. Unfortunately Trump is about to screw up health care even worse.
Using his son to promote a political agenda. I am tired of paying for other people's free stuff.
"Did someone call a wahbulance?"
Reminded me of forest gump .He must be a millionaire .
this was a really big eye opener. I hope that your boy is alright!
With tears in my eyes..prayers, love, and hugs for family, friends, and fans.
God bless that child
Clearly the GOP didn't see this video.
That's why you need to be Canadian
This monologue was beautiful. reminded me of Craig ferguson's monologues when he eulogized his parents and talked about his addictions. People should go watch those monologues on Youtube
Maybe if his wife wasn't doing COKE while she was pregnant the kid wouldn't be all f'd up!!😹
...another example of why affordable health care matters.
How has this video for 8000 dislike :(
This started out being a touching story and I'm happy everything turned out great for the Kimmel family. But, he should have just stopped there and not made it political.
me:* crying in the corner* that was soooo beautiful
sad seeing him use his sons birth defect as a way to push his anti trump propaganda
It would be so nice if Billy saw his dad seeing this of the future
This speech should be repeated before a joint session of congress.
I cried through this entire video. Jimmy Thank God your babyboy is okay Money means NOTHING Without your health And all the money in the world Cant prevent Things like this from happening 🙏❤
"The greatest Country in the world? You are kidding. All great countrys are in Europe. We have almost  free insurance.
its upsetting, but i am sure there is more to the whole issue with medicare. nobody wants anyone to die.
What a beautiful family glad everything worked out. This was just beautiful.
Oh my God, You are great, admirable inside and outside. Sorry your son have to go through so much. Congratulations that your son is doing well now. You simply rock. Wish you great days ahead.
Free healthcare in Kuwait and no taxes :)
jimmy kimmel, you are a douch bag for using your sons medical problem to push your own liberal political agenda.
God bless you and your family! ❤
Congratulations on your sons good health now Jimmy! But give this comment a like if you watched this video under 100 views!
I'm sure you can afford to pay for your kids medical bills, Jimmy. You're a dirtbag. Quit using your son as a leveraging tool to push your agenda you twit.
Jimmy we so appreciate you shared your beautiful son's success outcome Thank God he is doing well.
there are 8k dislikes? what is wrong with people?
Teared up and I don't even like kids.  Because: Humanity
You know, it was good. Sad story, terrible what happened to your child. And then you turned the story to go political.. Shame on you.
That "Not here" was a real tear jerker 😭
Horrible thing to go through.
this paid dumbass blaming his president...jeez don t use your child to manipulate people and make false claims. don t let the corporate elite deceive you all. #DoYourOwnResearch
People who disliked are Trump supporters
Because I had to wait for the ad to end. Thumbs down. Welcome to the real world, brother!
Well said, and thank God everything came out well. I understand what he went through and how it feels. Great video. He has made me laugh in the past, today he made me cry!
*FAKE TEARS!!!!!*
this is the first time that i see you crying jemmy, you made me sad but you are really amazing and great person in the world i just hope a good and most healthy life for you and your family as well.
To the people that disliked this video       🖕
HAve we forgotten he came from "The Man Show"?
Jimmy, wish you and your family, especially little Billy, all the best!
It's sad to see how many dislikes this video has. If you disliked, you have no heart.
I'm glad he's ok
new world order
anyone else thought of widowmaker?
God bless your baby ❤️
I got the exakt same Heartdesease and made it healthy to 35 years now. Don´t worry, best wishes to Billy from Germany
So incredibly happy that things are going well. Best of luck with the upcoming procedures. God bless!
Haha thanks god that happen to you jimmy.. I hope your son dies hahaha
Has the U.S government ever throught of doing  A UK style NHS service  that would mean that everyone would get treat regardless what money you have
What's with the dislikes? That's exactly why I never gave af about the american flag.
Damn I just want to give a hug to Jimmy and his family and all the people he called out.
the 7k that disliked this are midevil longshanks supporters
to the idiots saying "its not free is paid for through taxes" have a long think about your military budget and who pays for it.

Don't like the trailer. But I'll watch the movie then decide if I hate it because I'm finally mature enough to do so. Yay for me.
haha this! is the exactly the same story i'm having with my wife xD
it's the origin story of Pakistani Denzel
god damn the acting is horrible
This actually looks interesting.
I hope Anupam Kher has a bigger role..his name is not in the trailer though.
Movie looks promising and this guy Kumail is funny AF
Bo burnam at 2:00
Is that about his real life?
Aziz Ansari won't be happy with this.
Holy fuck this is a bollywood story - but in Hollywood BUT WITH A  PAKISTHANI. Barry Allen, you fucked up.
he needs more product in his hair
This looks more like a netflix rental than anything else; the lack of star power really is evident from the trailer. That being said, it still looks semi-decent.
Trust me Pakis are not this good.
This is the plot of 90% of the bollywood movies
what is the name of the songs in the trailer?
Looks interesting with a well written desi character in a Hollywood movie.
Well since it has Scumlims in this move I will never watch it. Probably a part of the Scumlim brotherhood
Third sexiest men in the world and they get this guy to play us in the romcom lead??!!...fuck it we'll take it as long as my Indian friends are butt-hurt ;)  the best hing its got Ray Romano
This one looks interesting.
Yesssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ASIAN! LEADING! MAN! Yesssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Muslims who leave the evil Islam tend to be awesome human beings!!!!! Hail Kumail, the atheist who left the evil Islam!!!!
Where is Gilfoyle.....??
We must love foreigners, we must love asians, latinos, fat people, gays, lesbians, transgenders, midgets, cripples, islamists. And if we dont we're all a bunch of misogynist racist fascists haters. So sick of it.
The CEO of PiperChat is a pretty eligible bachelor.

21:46 *The Big Sick* FuII~Movie ( plus.google.com/u/0/+cinematrix21/posts/6hwKg6B2uHT )
I saw the whole movie
Looks like the Patel documentary
I see that Bo Burnham cameo...
one those movies when the plot is great and authentic but most of the audience got big stick up in their assholes so they can't really enjoy it...
Pakistanis look like indians sans the accent.
I can't wait to see this, looks like just my kind of movie
Even though I don't agree with liberals, and am a conservative, I still found this movie trailer extremely funny! 😂
A.K.A My Big Fat Pakistani Wedding
i found it funny! Kumail's Conan Interview were fantastic and hilarious too.
Kumail Nanjiani! Yay! Oh and doesn't Nanjiani sound Italien? Or is it just me!?
Hey Bo Burnham's in this, not bad, still wont watch it though
I like it, looks like a good movie, atleast they are giving other people a chance to shine
We get it, white people are bad.
I hoped it was (a big virus killed humanity and a few survivors trying to stay alive) movie after reading the title :/
Fuck this movie.

I'm from the Philippines
can I get one of the female puppy because my puppy is all alone pls can I get one
I adore how she almost instantly realized Eldad, that you were there to rescue them all. After a few puppies, she gets up for you to retrieve the rest. <3 You are an angel sir. A true light hearted spirit. :)
They sold them and made money bustards
Hi guys I lost my dog she's a female boxer can you guys plz look for her contact me please
Thank god that the puppies were safe
so which camera crew member plans to take the dog home?
The puppies are just to cute
The puppies are so adorable awwww
That is so cool
how could you dislike this m8
Please tell me the pups won't be separated from the mother
The puppy are So qute and the mother dog is also qute Al animals are qute
who can possibly dislike this?
I only watched half of the video because I knew if I watched all of it is end up crying but I almost cried at the end
HALF OF THOSE DOGS NAMES WERE MINE AND MY FRIENDS DOGS NAMES
The power goes out when it storms in Hollywood, that can't be good? :D  You guys are doing an awesome job <3
Im atleast happy to see that there are people trying to help abandoned dogs and that they go so far without giving up
this channel never fails to make me smile and die of fangirl of how cute the dogs are.  anyone else?

The dog was like you trying to help me?
Me And My sister worked hard to get $10 each so we can donate soon
I hate how people dislike these videos it makes me mad THEY JUST SAVED ANIMALS lives I almost cry when I watch this.

Thank you for the work you do! Thank you for sharing it with us:)
I live in the U.K.? How do I donate. These people are amazing. They deserve a reward
Her face when he took the first puppy made me cry. It's obvious how much she cares about them.
Domesticated, probably dumped by the owner. Mix mom, who knows what else the pups are.
They are absolute Legends!
can I adopt even I'm far away?? I'm from Philippines
Well my dog gave birth while standing infront of me
Thank you!!!
There seriously can't be any other people on earth that spread so much joy to man and animal alike than you people. Thankyou.

if your watching on the 4th of may go downmay the forth be with you.
Waiting for the Kickstarter campaign for Abbey Road/Empire Strikes Back.
For the rest of my life, when I hear any songs from Sgt. Pepper, I'm going to sing these lyrics.
¡Forever BEATLES! ¡Happy  May 4th. force be with you!
love you, guys! :)
This is Star Wars and The Beatles having a baby I've never pictured somwthing like that, but now that I have it, it's just freaking georgeous well-done awesomeness.
Malwarebytes is blocking your site as malicious - what's the story?
The empire obviously knows... they are trying to capture her.  This is retarded.  And sacrilege to both the Beatles and Star Wars.
Whoever did this should get unlimited public funding.
"No. I...am the Walrus."
THIS IS THE ****BEST****!!!!
I have no words. There's no words to describe how awesome this and how well performed. None. <3
I heard this on the radio morning program Walton & Johnson, and I am Just happy I came. It doesn't get any better than this.
Absolutely brilliant!!!!!
Osm!!! Love this!!!!!
OMG this is the best thing ever.
Pretty good lol, check it out. Full Album available :D
This is pretty good soundtrack for today.
Amazing! Got to Listen to the entire Album! I used to listen to my big brother's Sgt Peppers vinyl album without permission all the time LOL!!!! Brilliant parody
Props go out to Hotair.com for posting this... and the entire album!  Quite literally one of the best things I have ever seen!
This is nothing short of brilliant!  Incredible job guys!!!
PURE AWESOMENESS!!!!
This is the reason no one will ever understand white people!
For once, I  find something before it explodes and goes viral. This is  excellent work.
Watched it at 2x speed. At that speed, the first song sounds it should be on MST3K with the visuals.
Cute, but nothing special. Mad magazine used to do musical parodies of movies all the time.
Whoever Downvotes this is a loser. Straight up.
This is like Weird Al-caliber. Just amazing.
They held a Mark Hamil look alike contest in 1978. The winner portrayed him in ESB and ROTJ. #Luke is dead (btw this is phenomenal) 
Bob & Tom brought me here. May the Fourth be with you.
Bravo boys and girls............take a well deserved bow!
I feel like I just watched the movie again for the first time. Such eager anticipation for each new scene and song. Wow y'all really nailed it. Fantastic genre mashup. Thank you !
Awesome happy May 4 from Chile!!!!!
I love how Vader gets the tune to the sweetest sounding song of needing help from your friends 😂😂
To make this perfect, it needs to be performed by the Fab Faux live.
Awesome, perfect
Going viral - you heard it here first folks.
Perfect for Star Wars day XD
Two things I adore The Beatles and Star Wars :)
Best thing in the world
finding this is the best thing to happen to me this year.
This was amazingly well done! Bravo
This is possibly the greatest thing in the history of things.
this is amazing.
This is awesome! Good job, OP!
That Ringo voice is so close to perfection that I found myself wondering, just for a second, "could that be HIM?". :D
Anyone else know straight away it was Beatles Sargent Peppers lonely hart club band?
Pretty stupid
i love the BB-8tles
This is amazing. Download the album for free link is in the description. So so good.
This is the best in youtube for years. OMG, absolutely brilliant. Thanks for doing this
Thank you for making this video.  My life is now complete.  [disintegrates in a pile of ashes]
This is genius, fabulous and has me singing. xoxox you guys are amazing.
Just download the album. Going to listen to it on the way to work. Thanks for the album gents.
this is the best thing i have ever seen
This made my day. Thank you. May the Force be with you.
This is now on NPR. I imagine it'll start blowing up soon
This is awful
So GOOD!!!!!!!
It's nice to see you uploading music again :D congratz on all the hits though "learn to spell" will always be my favourite.
One of the best films of all time + One of the best albums of all time? Fuck it, I'm gonna spend my evening watching this.
fuck me this is done so well!
Heeh! ;P by Tinja&Markku :D
Amazing. Just when I had given up on Youtube. Something like this pops up.
I love Vader's entrance. It makes the entire video worth watching!
Most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well.
Tomorrow, we'll make this viral. I hope against hope it doesn't go quite yet today...  May the 4th be with you!
Sheer Brilliance!  Outstanding, 5/5
It's...so....beautiful
Wonderfully amazing job.  Looking forward to listen and enjoying all of the songs on the album.
the beatles+star wars what a great mix for a music and cinema history
This album is a hit
What, no Falcon Loot Smuggler (Smuggler! Smuggler!)...?
Downloading this before Apple Corps and Disney respond with their usual amount of extreme copyright butthurt.
Star Wars AND The Beatles?!! I'm sold
This is brilliant. Simply amazing!! :D
Marry me. Have my children. On toast. For this is the thing the Internet was invented for.
That's best thing since 1977.
This is amazing.
I want those plans in my glove
U DID A better job than Beyo,nce &  Christina Aguilera.

YUSSSSSSS I'll get the Medium Version of the Intous pro 😄 Im soooo excited 😊
One has to say, the web design in 90s to early 2000s was truly diverse back then.
Whereas my web teacher in 2000 said we'd all be watching TV on the internet. We all thought that was ludicrous :P
I love jQuery :3
Jaymes Nelson no. sculptris and blender are 3d sculpting programs that  you can download for free. as far as I am aware adobe does not have a 3d  sculpting program
I knew it was a sponsored video before I opened it and was disappointed to find that I was correct...
im surprised how informative this video turned out despite being  sponsored. great job at not just guiding us through wix's interface.  that would be lame
Web design has changed a lot since the 90's and early 2000's :P
Damn, i came for HTML and CSS. I just left wix, to learn REAL web development.
Wix sounds like a synonym for Fap in German
I'm not even trying to make a website I'm just bored
learning how to make websites using wix is like learning how to code using scratch; WAAY too basic
Never clicked your videos that much fast!                33
Step 1 - Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Flash, or PHP. Step 2 - Build the website!
I thought you will teach us lessons of html, php and javascript ...
I prefer hand coding over a WYSIWYG

I  really like your videos because, you are very clear about everything  you show and tell. I have watched many videos but not like yours. Thank  you for shearing your awesome idea's
Bro, completely forgot about your channel omg. Slaps forehead Glad I've rediscovered  you!
your voice is one of the most awesome ones I've ever heard. Enjoy every video you make!
Thanks a lot Tavis, another great and useful series.  By the way, which text editor did you use in this tutorial??
what operating system are you using? Mac, Linux or Windows?
So glad you decided to do it. Looking forward to seeing them all.
So glad you decided to do it. Looking forward to seeing them all.
I love you're channel man ! I just wanna ask if there is gonna be a  video where you show how to deploy a website host it and update the  content when needed it :) Thnx again !
+DevTips This video is THE best video on the entire design process...and  THE best dev channel on YouTube! The "boring" parts are the most  essential and what people like us are looking for. I'm anticipating Part  2!
Awesome video Travis! I decided to make my own short clips of stuff  being created in codepen, and I've learned a lot from you. Just wanted  to say thank you!
Do you mean prospective employers (instead of perspective)
What company do you use for web hosting?
I would like to have sticker you've got on monitor.  :) Can you upload PSD?
Another first-class premium tutorial about to be served up.  Thanks for all of your effort.
Your channel logo is not sassy enough

Yanique is a real down to earth person, I don't care if she did surgery or not her personality is great so far.

A me alone think them interviewers yah need fi find another occupation? 🙄 Caan bother. Kmt.

What's with the yankee swag that every Jamaican female personality taking on. Everyone woman in Jamaica trying to be like their favorite American reality TV personality, it's not attractive.
Awesome interview. .you guys really stay on target even tho most of the questions Yanique try divert from it but you ppl on it  Kimmie we love you
I strongly believe that this interview is not professional the magnum host Should never commenting on a judge on the show like she wanted to start a conflict again. not acceptable
nightly fix no biscuits turn table short curuit #1Go
but yanique is just who she is down to earth.thats just basically her personna.

Awesome work! I used to always watch Star wars lego stop-motion videos when I was really into legos 6-8 years ago
That was great! You did an awesome job of storytelling also!
this video made my day, please make more of it !
This is my favourite Lego video so far!!!!!!!!
Hey this was REALLY good. The lack of dialogue and still being coherent gave it quite the charm. Good job. Hope to see more. Keep improving.
Good try, dood. Keep practicing, you'll only get better. :-)
what about the background music? this needs ambient music
This should be canon
I liked the ending
Nice work! And not one cameras shadow...Michael Bay take notes!
Very good! MOAR!!

target taste test featuring lotion and lamps

5:53: "Woah! What a different direction that this went in!" -Rhett Mclaughlin 2017
Pls like if you want to see guess the shoe from the shadow please
I am a photojournalist and was hired by the innocence project to take photos of a man released from prison after 13 years. It's was an amazing opportunity and experience.
"When and doubt throw a chicken out" link 2k17
can u do will it sand wich or will it sasage
Simply balanced fruit snacks are legit
I just jealised that Link looks like the comedian Jimmy Carr..  😱
can you start blogs plz??????
"Taste Test" You copped out on the lamp and moisturizer guys. If you're not above eating tree bark and lipstick you can handle a little wood varnish and lotion.
I almost spit out my drink at "But I don't know what's in it. Could be bodies!"
Will it boil for safety? Will it omelet? Will it Hat?
what are you talking about. Target is a name brand.
Isn't it amazing how the the human brain doesn't notice the second the
It upsets me they didn't turn the lamps on
Heyyyy, you can't fool us, guys. You already used that picture of Link for another thumbnail.
It's amazing how mad I get when listening to someone chew their food, yet I continue to watch.
Does anybody remember when they did this with walmart
WAIT they didn't taste the lotion, REDO THE VIDEO AND TASTE IT
I thought he was saying it smelled like an ant 😂
i recently took a break from this channel and just now came back to it. i am so happy i came back to it and am very happy. this channel is one i can always count on to make me happy
diGORINO like a boss
I was eating Target brand potato chips while watching this video
Omg when Link blew on his bite of tuna fish for no reason I was like YES I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT DOES THAT hahahah
the end is near
When he said the lotion smelled like an Aunt I thought he was talking about the insect
Walmart and Kroger comparison
"This is a milky business deal " wow man there married 
pls mute their mics when they're chewing...
Pause at 6:10 Link drinks out of Rhett's straw and Rhett doesn't notice
FRUUUUUUUUUUUUIT SNAAAAAAAAAAAAX
I would be the best at this! I've been to target too many times.
The fact that they oaid $280 for a lamp thet they didn't turn on.
Welch's was so obvious
I like simply balanced better than welches
who would win in a fight tho
i went to target to buy mens clothe and the selection is garbage.....yall suck😲
I LOVE THE TARGET FRUIT CHEWS!!!! (It's a healthy addiction 😆)
You guys mixed the Target brand and Welches brand on the fruit snacks...
Fruit is for losers, hahahahaha.
woooo!!!! olathe kansas!!! i work there :)
You guys should try baby foot peel
Pizza is better without or with light marinara
oh so the secret is the one that taste worse is from target
I love target so much
DO THE SPICY NOODLE CHALLENGE PLEASE
Jergens for that Jergen
its probobally a fish bone
Link can eat anything but when he sees an olive he goes crazy lol!!!
How have I never noticed that they change the picture in the background accordingly to the topic of every video
please don't give us the answers because we like to play along
WILL IT SLIME!!!!!!!!
WILL IT SLIME!!!!!!!!
Love the video !!!
REMEMBER ALEX FROM TARGET
you guys r gonna say im lying but when they were eating the gummies i could smell it😐
I am doing a livestream on my musically account. go follow me, @ballerstar583
i have a riddle for u. a man asks a girl how old she is. she says in 2 years,  will be double the age i was 5 years ago. how old is she? - can anyone find the answer? - dont cheat and look it up though
I work at target and my name is Alex. no joke. Alex from target watches rhett and link.
I was hoping you guys would taste the lotion.
*F R U I T  S N A C K S*
I feel like rhett and link are running out of fresh ideas
Do walmart or has that already been done?
"Two Guys.. Two bottles of lotion" Rhett 2017
When in doubt throw a chicken out
your wrong we have Aldi in America it's all over
"Of coarse I dont know whats in it... Could be bodies" Link 2017
you should do a will it orio
link sounded like me poopy butthole when he said the name of the game
Archer Farms>>>> DiGiorno on taste. I've never tasted a frozen pizza so bad as DiGiorno. Even Jack's brand is better.
When in doubt throw a chicken out!
me and my friends actually did this, expect with Wal-mart. xD
Trader Joe's taste test!
Its a taste test and they didn't taste the lamp or lotion.
Someone needs to edit a video exclusively of their eating sounds.
I wish they could do a Wegmans brand taste test. They have the best generic brand stuff.
Close your eyes at 9:40 and listen to the audio. It gets a whole different meaning
You guys WOULD call it 'Jerjens' you can't pronounce Gif properly after all.
I was kinda expecting them to eat the lotion lol
should have done it blindfolded
"Two guys, 2 bottles of lotion."   Mm hmm. I'm just going to leave that right here. lol
omg Link... "this one smells like a grandma..this one smells like an aunt." in reference to lotion...wtf haha
He drank out of Rhett's straw for the protein powder
This is a taste test but they had lamps and lotion
Chicken of the sea bruh
Hahaha, Bra Cosmo first plays Mfundi Vundla on his staff (fire them all) before agreeing to give them the overtime payment.

This is very good advice for anyone who works for a non-profit.  Thank you SO much for posting this video!
What the FUCK is this bullshit?
Giving in return to society can be achieved in a much better way thru CSR activities instead joining an NGO (directly). Work what you're passionate about, give something back to society thru CSR.
I wanna remember you that these people lives into the meadle of the shit, what this video dont made you feel conform. Its really terrible
Just ask FIFA, Non-profits are great!!!
Thanks or this video. Looks like I won't be applying to any NGOs.
This video was very insightful, thank you
They quit because they dont know what they want with their life.
how does one make a living by working for non-profit companies?
I'm too lazy to do anything , no motivation at all t.t maybe I'll try doing volunteer work at an old folks home nearby this coming December 
We need more philosophical/political topics covered by Slavoj Zizek! :D
Very helpful video thanks!  It's important to have your boundaries and not try to do everything
Be weary of charity, lest you do more harm with open arms, then with closed fists.

this is great!

Ya'll have no standards, intentionally raping bad and being as random as can be but yet "thats fire" "keep going" "it's lit". You guys call anything good, thats why so many trash artist get so overhyped up.
Nigga did you just say Texas is my home L
This is fire🔥🔥🔥
This is too accurate 😂😂
i thought u were chris travis
I keep coming back to this i can't believe how identical they sounds
he killed it but not to much on him he has fire music oopps I touched him and my hand burned
hey guys maybe he took them incase something bad or anything would of happened because at least they nit in the house evertime mainly they are but still its their dad
i support wverbody i just think its wrong all i dont like is that cody and emma crying it make me sad{
even her name is a blessing 🌹 🌹 I'm happy for you and your children!!  😇 I hope you gain full custody! And have a peaceful loving recovery 🌹🌹🌹
but think about the kids they love daddy0five
Tim colon your a cool guy
it"s called ... PRAYING FOR THOSE PAVE THE WAY FOR A BIGHT FURTURE.  Just think God Knows ALL Hearts.
if i was her i would be upset!!!!   she is not even upset.    omg  . she  cant even speak about basic motherly instinst.   very  passive.
455 people beat their kids for no reasons
Yesssss!!! This is so awesome to hear. I did my part and flagged every video I could before they all disappeared, justice is being served!
Why didn't she know anything about this and file charges a long time ago??????
This is a perfect Mother's day gift just to have her children back. I'm so happy for her!
I bet you Cody and Emma want to see his dad
why did she (the real mother) lost the costudy of them in the first place?  we all hate daddyofive and rightfully so, but doesnt seem like many people are asking if this woman will be a proper mom... just asking!
I like my girls bbw ;)
"Coda and Emmy"
i was smiling when she was talking like that about her kids.  She truly wants the best for them. Cody and Emma just like Ryan Alex and Jake need a lot of a fix. Due time, due time.
Wait so why were Cody and Emma in daddyofive possession in the first place?
I only found out about this after all the videos for removed. is there anyway I can watch any coz I want to see how bad they are??
Finally, some good news from YouTube.
I am so glad that things are going in a positive direction for you. I saw the original content and was greatly disturbed at how your children were treated. Thank you as well, Tim, for helping her. You're a saint.
Does anyone know why she didn't have custody in the first place? And how the dad was deemed the "better" parent and got to keep Cody and Emma for so long?
What about Jake,Cody And Alex?Any opinions guys. ?
I just started youtube and saw all this drama.Dont know shit about what's happening
Now they can have a normal life with no cameras in their faces
Why didnt they edit this or simply re record it when she was in a better state of mind? (((10.2)))
*When I first clicked on this and heard the start of the video I thought this was a parody of the DaddyOfive apology video.*
I really hope she gets the help need it for her to keep her kids... That is a great job you have done Tim, good look on the rest of the case
But she DID throw the kids away, and without her throwing them away like she did, NONE of this would ever have happened. Those kids are scarred for life, no matter how much they improve.
how come she DIDN'T have custody in the first place??????????????
This made me so happy❤️ how lovely it is to reunite with actual LOVED ones💕
the real question is why did Rose have her kids this whole time is pretty hard for a MAN to get custody over a woman so whats the real story with this lady?????
IS SHE RETARDED
please take care of those children. please they deserve a happy childhood and a safe and loving environment
it's creepy how this tim conlon guy has orchestrated this to get advertising for himself. that said, I'm glad the children are going to be in a less traumatizing situation.
#suejoysparklebs i might hire you to sue joysparklebs for stalking
we did it. we fucking did it. lets throw a fucking party. im not even kidding i will have a party :P
Well we just saved pointless child's
i'd like to get the other three helped now, too. put Mike and Heather behind bars and get the poor kids the mental help they need. they'll grow up to be abusers or even killers otherwise.
Please sue you tube and daddy o five parents for punitive damages!!!!!!!!!!
All the respect in the world for you rose!
This jerk using this situation as advertisement is not cool. I hate people like this. Look at him with his banner and phone number.
faith in humanity has been restored. :)
She looks tired.
It's so good to hear those two kids are out of that awful home situation. I first heard it from Philip DeFranco's YouTube channel.  I hope the other 3 kids get the help they need as well.
so happy that she has the kids back is there anything we can do to show our support or help her in any way so she can keep the kids
To me this looks fake-no hate
one video cannot prove a case
Three to go!! #daddyoprison
Ima get hate but idc is anyone else but me still on team DO5 and still supportive and want them to get cody and emma back so they can live a nice life and go to disney? Plz someone get on my side before i get hate
How is possible that a mother could lose custody over her kids? She must have been a shitty parent herself. I feel so much for the two little ones. Their dad is a loser and the mother looks like another dead end.
This is a mom who needs an award
now it's time for her to make the videos ripping cody and make some MONEY like this lawyer in posting this vid
She looks like Emma!
Hi hate that red head I can tell she lied
Mr. Conlon, I appreciate you. You and rose are such beautiful human beings.
The guy on her left has dollar signs in his eyes. $$$
if that were me in front of that camera id be looking every where but the camera id be shaking my leg at 100 miles per hour id stutter go blank, its uncomfortable when you're not used to it
i feel bad for the rest of their siblings that either might get put with their grandparents or stay with them
Why didn't she have custody in the first place ? I mean not to be sexist but I would have my kids at least 50/50 of the time if not full
Listen I am not a fan of DO5 but for a mother to not had custody of her kids in the first place means for was never fit to be a mother.
Lol we all know why she wanted custody of them kids for, she wanted that big pay check that comes with them.
goodluck on raising them now ROFL
damn she thiCC
everyone that gets mad about the "they just act" thing watch keemstar interview daddyothree that clears the thing.
Good for you Rose! :) I'm glad that the kids are safe! I hope we can do the same for the other three as well.
my heart is happy now.
Great that they are away from those two "parents".  But lets be clear, the community is going to be watching out for these kids for a LONG time. We sense anything fishy with the mother, we will react the same way.
I didn't know what's her bitch face wasn't their real mother. Who the fuck is she to curse and yell at someone's else's kid like that?
This some bull shit 😂😂💯
This is all bullshit
Just found out that you took this case for free. You are an amazing man for helping out. You have earned mine, and many others, respect.
lol this bitch looks like a parent who would beat there kids also so
Why are they recording this on a camera like from 2005.

I don't understand why these girls hangout with these douchebags. Says a lot about them.
LMAO HOW CAN YOU TRASH HARRIS's lebrons like that. I would love to see someone trash qias shoes so hard. that would be a hilarious prank.
You should've asked Sintb to do it for you.
Qias is still salty from last year playoffs when golden state blew a 3-1 lead, thts why he messed with Harris shoes
Dude going to be fucked if he tries cleaning them
Yoo ask Ahmed where he got em jeans
QIAS the type of guy to fart in a toilet and flush it
QIAS the type of guy to tell a grocery cart "don't let these people push you around"

So saying that all lives matter is "douchbag" behaviour?      Y tho?
the most douchebag part of this video is the thought that saying all lives matter is some how douchey. this is why this video is making hardly any hits
Ezigbo Anuofia of life.
Younger Will Ferrel anyone?
2010s needs a giant beard
Gotta love a trending video that I actually enjoy! I would also add that 1950s and 1980s douchebags made a comeback in 2010s too ;)
the 60s one seems a bit new-wave/Tears For Fears look
All of these douchebags can spray my rear entrance with their daddy juices.
Please, make a female version! 2010 would be the duckface selfie queen and her counterpart - the angry feminist with red lips, glasses and a bun :D
The hair is out of frame for half the bloody video.
2010 douche wants muslim jihadists to enter country. It's the most poisonous of them all
50/60s look I don't think qualifies but the rest especially 2010 hits the nail on the head.
Mark Wahlberg isn't that bad
Wow you really do pull off being a douche bag well. I hated each evolution equally, good job.
The man bun?  You guys frikkin NAILED it.  I thought you were going to go for the stereotypical hippie in 60's but instead you went for the rockabilly which is definitely a more of a 60's thing than people realize.
So glad to have found this channel on Trending, you really deserve it! 😀
The 90s glorious 90s
90s style , he looks like Bart baker.
Only 40's kids will remember this...😑(kill me)
this guy looks way too much like bart baker
1950s douchebag could get it tbh.  and lmao @ ~all lives matter~ at the end!
omg this video is gold
The only thing wrong with this video is that it implies that only black lives matter and all lives don't matter at the end, way to make a supposed comedy skit political you fucking regressives
i wanna hit this guy
0:22 OMG can you lick pussy like that!
i look just like this lad  Like if you're the same
top-notch douchebag
How is this trending?
The 80s one is just a preppy kid
MFW his last words are a truth-bomb. :/  MFW it's heartening to know SJW will appear in future History of Douchebag vids :]
dbags...or fuccboi? lel
Hope there's gonna be ,,Evolution of Slut Style'' as well!
A complete douchebag, congrats! And the statement in the end, really douchey, what a well thought-out video! Great acting skills.
80s douche is straight up matthew glave in the wedding singer, i love it smhhhh that's grade A top choice meat!
I'll be honest, these don't really start to get douchey until the 90s.
I get that he was trying to pull the douchebag off, but the very last comment was actually true
Can anyone tell me what song this is?
When you look like a douchebag to start, all these styles are easy to pull off.
and he was hooking up with girls with the 2010s propaganda
The 80's perfectly suits him
What's that 60s haircut called
This had me dying laughing. I think that the 90s and 2000 are tied for biggest douchebag
the 60s style looks actually nice, remembers me of Albert Camus
50's douche bag looks good haters welcome.
Tunnel snakes rule
VDOS?! if you watch the video you'll get it ;)

Hey guys you're the best I can't stop watching your  clips like the get a shout out mobbsie101
sounds like united has put themselves in a very bad situation here lately. CEO might want to start looking for a job at McDonald's, as a server.
They knew what to expect with United, and still chose to fly it. No empathy for their misfortune.
If anyone is interested in ready-made wedding speeches the greatest success that ive ever had was by using the Talking Template Bundle (i found it on google) definately the best course i've followed.
Got their asses beat united style
United again??
That's not chum?
For some reason, I don't believe these people. More to it than they are telling.
will united go down that's what matters if not its all for nothing.
If you have somebody lying on your assign seats, you just call a flight attendant to deal with this problem. When you are up in the air you can move to another seat if it is available.
*United we stand; divided we FALL.*
United is cancer
When it rains for United, it pours.
Again...???
Here we go..........again..............for the second time
United is on a roll
Has anyone considered that United wants to go bankrupt and fail intentionally for some hidden cause?
Damn I might fly United just so I can sue them for some dumb shit, or at least make the news lol
so united actually showed some restraint
United might as well just close up shop lol
I will literally never fly on United ever again. Delta, Jetblue, and Southwest are all good options.
Never flying United after this crap. Airports are enough hassle as it is
united is screwing up royally
Not really gonna blame united for this one
United is meme machine!
what's going on with united? Everyone was upset when the president put a flight ban for 7 countries over seas but can't protest the injustice here at home!?
United: How many times do we have to teach you a lesson old man?
not going to sit there and argue with you. Comply or get off.
guess they weren't "diverse" enough.
Do we need cameras in planes too?
Back at it again
Damn united back at again removing people from planes
What's so good about flying in the front?
I think united gets turned on imagining those numbers disappear from their bank account. Because if they keep on doing this there going to have nothing left
Waa now United has a bad rap so EVERYONE wants to accuse them of shit. Probably needed the money for their wedding. 99% of the shit on news is faux. Gtfo here u dumb cunts!!
UNITED...against the customers
Awww shit I'm taking United in June!!! Wish me luck everybody!!!
If you book and fly with United after seeing the doctor get abused by this company...you get what you deserve.
United Airlines is really trying to lose their money here
Would much rather fly allah uakbar airlines...
Three strikes, and you're out, United.  Don't screw up again...
I find it complete bullshit that this channel and other company's still get paid through youtube while youtubers dont
I'm definitely not pro united after that whole doctor thing, but this stuff happens all the time on almost any airline...   overbooking is a very common practice, because they assume that not everyone will show up
I was just at the airport and there was no one in line for United for ANYTHING
They just can't do anything right, can they?
Who's surprised?
I'm on united on this story the guy was in the wrong
As Abraham Lincon once said "United we stand, United will fall." United we stand meaning that we stand on United because they are always overbooked.
Who's gonna believe united at this point tbh
I refuse to fly United Airlines.
How long till someone sues United
So they were trying to get upgraded seats for free? I'm sure there were seats behind them they could have easily moved to. I'm sure they were just trying to take advantage of recent united airlines problems.
Damn don't fly with united they don't care if your a doctor or on your way to your wedding they will kick you ass off the plane for nothing 😂
Man United is shit
I am not sure if I believe the couple. Just take your assigned seats.
Fly The friendly skies. ha! Getting thrown off planes
Houston is not a bad place for honey moon
We are not amused.
How strange they skip past their assigned seats all the way to the first row with more room.
It's easy. STOP FLYING UNITED.
United part two
Yeah, but what if what United is claiming is true? Do we just blindly hate on them because of the controversy they've been known for, and let further customers abuse the system?
This is RIDICULOUS #neverflyingunited
RIP united 2017
Sorry I have been writing about the wrong incident, I was under the impression that the man sleeping in their seats had been issued with a ticket for that seat.
"Kicked off" Literally?
So close to 1738...
Just wake the guy up! Who falls asleep on someone else's seat?
I don't know if I belive this
HOW LONG UNTIL YOU PEOPLE STOP BITCHING LIKE A BUNCH OF PUSSIES?
I mean how many L's can one company take?
Plants by competing entities that have a lot to win shorting United stock over the next year?  Maybe.  Hit United while they're wounded and keep the anti-United sentiment flowing.
Today I paid more to fly another airlines just to void United.
UNITED FUCKIN SUCKS
United Airlines will file for bankruptcy very soon.... Idiots!
lmao united taking so many L's lately
they should have just gotten a flight attendant to ask the dude to move. not just go do what they want without their permission. everyone has to follow SOPs
United: For the price of two seats, miss your trip to Costa Rica for free!
Nothing much surprises me any longer.  Gold & Silver, Google: House Joint Resolution (HJR 192)
btw this is what the bible means when it says come out of babylon. do not have any dealings with these pagan affairs
OMG! For so long I had this epiphany and this is why Yahwah wouldn't allow me to obtain such status! God is good...
I'm just curious as to where you got this information. Is it online where I can find it?  This is so shocking.
You broke it all the way down!!
very good video. but where is the list of what churches can and cannot do?
OOPs 501C3 is an agreement that the church will inform the IRS of their revenues...and their members revenues...
Can you post a quick link or the form numer
So 501c3 status is like hush money. Interesting!
How can I find out if a church is 501c3 before I join them?
For number 31. Promote or encourage alternative healthcare (herbs, vitamind, etc). Are you talking about Holistic medicine?
Not only "churches" that are using 501c3 , but ALSO any "not-for-profit-organization", or charity group that is supporting or joining this "TAX-BRAKE", is also joining the BEAST SATANIC SYSTEM or NWO.
They teach that a slave ship is our Messiah, and The father is a Wooden/Stone Entity. Smfh
Truth about relationship man and womans personal favour.
This is when the church will go underground & a pastor will only speak his/her true feelings & thoughts to small groups of trusted members.
I am totally shocked.  We Christian's need to do out research.  Lack of knowledge is dangerous.
GREAT VIDEO ACH, SHALOM.
A MEN!! I Love the truth!  I knew something was wrong with the church when I started to learn more at home then what I was getting in the church!!!
Does Christian yoga count and having new members take personality test?
Hi TruthUnveiled 777, good info!   Where did  you get the info for the church need to apply listing and the list for the 56 restrictions which the church would be under with the 501c3!
thank you so much for your time and research put into these videos.   can anyone reccommend a good church that speaks the truth around the DFW area in Texas? Thank you and God Bless
Yup they are, go to kim and mikes ex jw website. A whoole lot of info
So does this mean the pastor must pay their members who go out to preach to the public and who help clean and build churches they are employees
I was wondering about that....I understood churches to be automatically tax exempt and were for years and years.
How do you know if a church is a 5013c church?
imagine that, it is illegal to use the bible to refute catholic doctrine!
People Steeple=obelisk=phallus of the sun god Baal
Even if they don't seem to be bringing all these stipulations to bear yet, I'm sure they will.
#staywideawake he's the same age as me our eyes are open
talk about the 501c4 and how will 501c4 benefit the people of the world???????
Separation of church and state is clearly being neglected here...
i actually never knew this about 5013c but i googled 5013c and new world order and apparently this has been known by MANY which surprised the heck out of me! another evil piece to their freemason puzzle
I'm waiting to see what product you push soon.
This is the most agreeable comment section i've ever seen and i'm loving it!👍👍Glad, and it's good to see everyone on the same page.
Wow! No wonder those tv preachers spew sugarcoated lies! They basically can't even tell the truth! I wouldn't be under that restriction. Just proves what people will do for money
Ok..good info..but I can't handle the names you are calling Jesus Christ.  What the heck is this?
is there prof tha the Jehovah's witnesses are a port of this 501c3
like i said you EDOMITES go to the book of OBADIAH TO LEARN YOUR FUTURE
THIS MEANS NOTHING TO A ISRAELITE. A ISRAELITE IS GOING TO PREACH THE TRUTH NO MATTER WHAT. SO THIS IS BULL CRAP TO A BELIEVER
LISTEN THE CHURH IS THE  PEOPLES NOT NO BUILDING
IF YOUR IN A CHURCH IN THIS DAY YOUR IN THE WRONG PLACE. YOU ARE WORSHIPPING THE DEVIL AND DONT EVEN REALIZE IT. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT KIND OF PAPERS THEY HAD TO SIGN
IF YOU ARE A SOCALL WHITE PERSON YOUR BIBLICAL NAME IS EDOMITE. YOUR A EDOMITE AND TO LEARN WHAT YOUR FUTURE HOLD IS TO GO TO THE BOOK OF OBADIAH IN OUR HOLYBOOKS
YOUR FOUNDING fATHERS  WERE THE DEVIL. THEY DONT GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH GOD ARE HIS PEOPLES THE ISRAELITES. WHOM YOUR DIRTY FF HAD IN SLAVERY
hey great video i always told my mom it was a scam church that is but most ppl dont want to accept they are beign fooled its easier to fool p than to tell them they are beign fooled.  shalom
we the people are the church, Yahuah our father Yahushuah our brother our lord. if we are the church as a people we should be tax exempt, only atheist should pay tax lol...
hey chris, can you or anyone on here tell me what day the sabbath day is. is it on saturday or sunday?:/
of course flat earth is banned in this satanics temples
Truth, do an update of Hillary Clinton campaign.
ARREST THE ELITE NOW!!
this  is  why I'm  7th  day  Adventist. This is bad!
like the snake mr olsteen?
Its the churches who stood up to the British. This is why LBJ illegally started the 501 c3 crap.
great video, thanks!
This is why my moms pastor broke away from the  AG church . If you have a church it is mandatory you have this or you cant have a church bank account  or u woll have to pay tax .
+Truthunveiled777 Have you ever heard of Christian Cultural Center, which I found out is private but still pays taxes?
Chris, You did a wonderful/great service for the people of Yahuah today...shalom
Question? how do I find out if my church is 501c3
Caesar is just taking back what is Caesar's anyway.
Good video thanks
Already knew this,,, very old news to me,,, that's why I "came out of her"  years ago.
EASY- stop labeling your group as a church.... just a group of people getting together to worship.  use someones barn, or garage.
So I'm a bit confused. The church I go to is 501c3. They break many rules on that 56 item list of No Go subjects. How do they retain there 501c3?
https://www.amazon.com/RACE-DEMONS-REFINED-Alliance-Brotherhood-ebook/dp/B009TZRISY?ie=UTF8&ref_=rdr_ext_sb_ti_hist_1
dezion by the government  tax system of churches  a man cannot serve two masters god  or mam om
Truth do a video on the Swiss tunnel opening
Demons are the one that make people do magic

17:30 Mason you have to turn your back to the ball but lesson learned
Mason did a great job playing up
mason you played amazing for 11u i know 12u players that are not as good as you
Go sub to my you tube Bryson Lawson trying to get 100 subs
what is the new team name
rawling is the best in my opinion and the gloves are cheaper at the outlet
I think that mason is older than me but I play 12 u
IMO: You should play with the team you committed to (basketball) Not fair to the coach and team mates. Especially to a team he doesn't normally play for. Should of went with Wilson glove. HA
I am 13 and I play on a majors team and something mason can work on is more power and faster hands on his swing.
He's really good at baseball
You guys are still in basketball?
Baseball *greater than sign* Basketball.
If he gets new basketball shoes get Jordan's or nikes
When Mason Shoots the b ball tell him to tilt his feet
Not to sound rude but your son is really bad
Are you allowed to charge the mound in this league
Awesome video I really like it lot it was cool
Mason is good at baseball
like your vids
Masons a stud.
What team is that he is playing with
you guys rock you are my favorite youtubers
he played good with that team
Dear Mason Bevos Wear Your Slip Sneakers in The Family House

TheBevos you guys are awesome!
Good offspeed pitches!
YOOO THEIR BASKETBALL TEAM IS TRASH LOL 56-10 AT2:24

Was mason playing catcher the 3rd game
Mason was looking very good out there in 11U you couldn't tell he was the young one!
Also mason is the best at baseball
Hi can i have shoutout for my instgram love your vids you should make murch
That glove is a catchers glove
your videos are so good
Mason pretty much as good as most of the players on my higher school team
Can I get a like for my bday
To help mason squeeze he's glove he should use a batting glove.It helps me
I'm a 11 year old travel player I played up in league last year it's easy to switch
These pitchers stink ( I'm 11 so I'm their age so I can say that)
I love you'll keep doing the good work.
I saw one of your guys older vids. It was the AAA championship one. After like 5 minutes of watching I immediately subscribed. These guys deserve well over 1mil on YouTube. I also play baseball as well.
I have a brother named mason
Tell Mason that he can take a bigger lead-of because when he holds his hand out he has a lot of extra space great tournament
your videos are amazing and mason is so good
Awesome vid

I played the strikers before last year actually
Please make another Shopping for basketball shoes I really enjoyed that vid!!!
Love the video
Straight outta Compton.  Did you go to the Watts Towers?
I think you are going to see a subscriber jump on your Route 66 quest!
You said 3 times that it was not really Compton, yet you put that in the title. CLICKBAIT! The ballgame was on April 19. What a loser you are.
OH ERIC, Bad place to park!! Not worth leaving JAX there alone in Compton! Thought you were staying at a friends property.
Great Video!!
while eric was at the dodger game, jax was kicking it with some skank hoes from compton
And your video shows why cities put up no overnite parking signs
I envy your life!!  Thank you for sharing
Omg!!  scared me at first!!...then I just lost it...to damn funny!!!  That Jax is a hoot ;)  Seriously you guys crack me up! Safe travels :)
thats on netflix i think u will like it alot
Haha!! A little tipsy at the end there huh Eric??
As Jax would say, if this van's a rockin, don't come knocking!
lucky dog, gettin to Dodger blueland...and SEE REAL Major League Baseball!!..not that stuff shown in Seattle where the pitchers don't bat...lol..looks like ya got some pretty primo seats, too!!
I'm ratting you out to the Mariners!  Safe travels from Anacortes.
I stealth van camp to avoid places like this.  Although in all honesty it didn't seem as bad at night as would be expected.  loved the video. ..keep it up;)
hey eric, when you get around the chicago area in june/ july, message me, il meet up with you downtown, and treat you to an Italian beef, and an Italian lemonade on taylor street...
That freaking place is scary. I got my serpintine belt cut off in Compton. But they struck out. I carry a spare, and was out of there in 15 minutes. Never to return. It is a cesspool.
Eric!!! I love your videos!!! My girlfriend & I watch you all the time!!! Next time you are in NJ Turkey Swamp Area we would like to take you out for a great steak dinner!!!! Safe travels!!!!  Shorefoot
Hahaha Jax has a good time while dad is away! Loved the nachos bowl. Very cool!
Congrats on the 100K!!!  Now DRIVE!
You got me! When you went to the RV and there was music, I thought something bad had or was about to happen. Compton s a pretty rough place, right? Glad that you and Jax made it through the night okay :)
it makes me sick to see how those idiots live you seen my van Eric I'm pretty clean and stealthy about it
If we do not see a video in the next couple of daysRIP Eric :)
I would give u double thumbs up for your "buzz" :-) but there is no double thumbs up. U're funny when u celebrate. Celebrate more, life's short dude :-)
Compton is not part of America.People like that need to be in government programs not on our streets.
Looks like California to me. You're not safe till your in Red Bluff.
You are so cute with your buddy Jax
Eric you better roll with you Glock if you are in Compton
Hi Eric -- just found your vids and love your travels. Of course, Jax is the main star!  Keep on having the best life and enjoy. But seriously, Compton? Be safe, get outa Compton.
I can't believe you stayed there overnight. That place was disgusting. The staged party clip with Jax was hella funny, though.
LOL at the JAX listening to California love! He is WEST SIDE.
Alarms and security cameras won't be of much help really.  The best option is to avoid the area.
people who empty black tanks in the streets have to be mentally ill.
You just have a knack for making good videos. You are loveable. How is Jax weight loss??? I was hoping you would inspire me to help my 15 & 1/2 yr old obese dog, who is actually smaller than Jax.
please get stabbed while youre there.
lol that cat is funny  great video Eric
love the drunken ending. enjoying  the full Compton experience
I've never seen Dodgers stadium from the inside before.  Very cool!  Love me some baseball!
eric was this the game that the dodgers came back in the bottom of the 9th inning?
Let me get this straight...$11 to $13 plus bucks for a beer?!?!?! Talk about highway robbery.
Dude, Compton is A VERY BAD AREA! You do not belong there. You and your rv are not safe there especially at night. Your video is misleading and might make some older middle class rver think it is an OK place to park.
DON'T go to Compton!!!!  It's MUCH worse than you episode in Eureka CA!!!  RUN!!!!
I can't believe those prices.  I'll watch the game on TV.
That was really interesting thanks Eric, that has me in meditation and reflection seeing that. Seeing the stadium was equally interesting another interesting, educational, entertaining video.
Straight into Compton.
compton is the worse city for bondocking! that place is a blood bath
how many 13 dollar beers does it take to get drunk? haha
Was drunk af by the end of the video lmao.
haha I think you had maybe one to many to drink at the end.
You should've stayed on Redondo Beach Blvd. you were in the borderlines of Gardena/Compton
stay out of Compton Eric, extremely bad idea....I have driven that street a million times for work, bad bad idea....
These people are surviving the best they can. They do not have garbage service there.
your a lot braver man than I am lol. I drive a truck to Los Angeles every week, and I won't stay in Compton.  Just sayin
You will not blend in you are white! Get your butt outta there! Your life depends on it.
I like the part where he drank beer and ate junk food. I'd like to see more of that.
If you headed through Las Vegas on you next video and need some tips or a place to boondock send me a message.
Jax was running from that Dodger Blue like he was a Giants Fan... the Horror!
Fun and very interesting! Love the ending! Made me think of Garfield!
I like watching your videos
I tell you what, if you get drunk at the Dodgers Stadium you will certainly leave there broke as well. lol
I have to assume you never saw the movie"straight outta Compton"! Glad your outta there.
LOL.... camping in Compton.... You ain't from around here are ya....
If your heading east down I-10 checkout the dinosaurs in Cabazon then go to the Palm Springs tram, you can google both.
eric. come upto ventura. win co's free parking over nite.  love to meet you.
"Just let it happen." With a cat?! Yeah, right! Fun vid. Thanks, Eric.
haah your so sozzled in this one good for you having fun : thats whats life is all about
People not keeping the streets clean should be asked to move on.
Jax is a Mariners fan! So funny!
RV camping in Compton, OMG!  Be very careful.
You are in a very bad area and you need to leave now. No joke.
Wow what a junk yard.... no wonder so many cities ban RVs.....I'm amazed the don't do something about it.
lol You party animal Jax!!
I wouldn't even slow down in Compton. Actually, I wouldn't be in Compton, to slow down. Just when I thought you finally had your head screwed on tight. I'm kinda surprised you'd make such a foolish choice.
Are those prices of beer the April Fools joke? Those are Insane prices!
I think Jax was saying "Don't leave me"!
Peace of mind? I feel it was very irresponsible to boondock in that particular location. Not cool E not cool.
I'de like to make a formal and respectful request for slightly longer videos, please.
Lmao PAC playing with jax chillin like a villain
Sad to say that those RVs are part of the reason California doesn't welcome RV'ers.  and Yay - go Mariners (they are so bad this year it's so sad)
Eric said it's quiet there, I say fuck that, Its Compton Get the hell out of there!!!!
$13 for a beer, what highway robbery and people but it? Compton is a bad area of LA. I wouldn't stay there overnight in fact I wouldn't drive through it. By the way Compton is a separate city, not part of LA.
Compton. ..are you crazy.!? safe..yeah right.
they say the city of Compton is a city of punks............only takes a minute to pop the trunk!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love jj he physical and he's an all around player and I love dion waiters he was big for us and it's waiters county lol
rose to the spurs .
Heat could get more cap space up to 60 mil if we let go of chris bosh who we are still waiting on because of health
Paul George
I'm here because I saw derrick rose and the bucks
Derrick rose, antetekounmpo holy shit
waiters would be dope on the jazz if they keep Hayward
I also like Gay at pelican , wizards,OKC, Houston
I would like to see Hayward going to new Orleans or Washington
There's no way JJ and Dion leavin, Heat is family. #Culture
fuck nooo,  Milwaukee needs to stay away from Rose
KD to CLEVELAND !!!
Heat should resign Waiters and JJ for sure!
i would say re-sign johnson and waiters, but they're gonna cost too much we need to put our money into Gordon Hayward and then try to trade for Paul George
Um....there was a report saying Rudy Gay might opt in because he got injured and knows he probably won't get as much money if he opts in. So I think he opts in and stays in Sacramento.
it will be funny if heyward go to Golden State with KD draymond Curry and Klay lol.
cp3 should join hayward and paul george and he will win a championship.
I really think that Derrick Rose should go to the Spurs
I'd LOVE TO SEE GEORGE HILL ON THE BUCKS
If the knicks give max money to George hill im gonna kill myself.
I'd be ok with Rudy Gay and Blake Griffin on the Thunder
you should have talk about OJ Mayo
Gordon Hayward won't leave the Jazz
Rose should stay only if the knicks do not get a better pg
I pray to god jj doesnt do a ring chase and join the warriors
Johnson is great but I'd rather have Waiters. From a heat fan.
Should the Heat resign Waiters and Johnson?  HELL YES!
I hope Hayward and hill stay in Utah
Your right on point with Rudy Gay
I'm a heat fan and I would love both Waiters and James Johnson back. They offer a drive and kick game not many guys offer and I'd love to see us regroup and build off this past season.
Jazz fan here, and Hill is a must stay, otherwise, we would have an unstable offense with a ok-ish PG spot.
Jazz should sign d Williams and paul milsap
What about Otto porter
Yes as a Heat fan I do think the heat should resign both Dion Waiters and James Johnson
Miami would be the 2nd best place for Hayward.  Imagine Hayward, Dragic, Whiteside, and Dion Waiters?! Look out for this!!!
Dion said he wants to get Miami a championship. As a fan that's very far away but Dion should stay.
What about Otto porter
Like if u think d rose to spurs
WE WANT JAMES JOHNSON AND DION WAITERS TO stay
what about Chris Paul
Derrik Rose has got to come to the Bucks!!!!!!! 🌹
I want James Johnson and Dion Waiters on the Heat again
Officially starting on Saturday Click subscribe and notification bell
I kinda want millsap or a young guard like lowry or derozan so there can be a big 3 in utah
lowry simmons and embiid would be NASTY
D ROSE IS GONNA LEAVE AND AS A KINCKS FAN I HOPE
keep rose he is a beast
Kyle Lowry always pointing me!!!
As a knicks fan if we resign rose im shooting myself
he should go to the blazers
JAAAAMES JOOOOHNSOON AND DION WAITERS HAVE TO STAY!
If bucks get d.rose it will be really helpful for them because despite the injury of his rose can still score 20p in 20-30 minutes and help a team take some easy points
Curry might go to the hornets
Derrick Rose could Teach the Greek to be clutch
James Johnson must stay
I don't want Lowry and DeRozen to get separated. I think they compliment each other very well.
yes want them back
The Jazz should try to get Millsap back and trade Derrick Favors. Let Hill go and try to get CP3 to the Jazz or another point guard
We need johnson and waiters
i would like both james and doin to stay
As a Bucks fan i like D Rose but we would be better off not getting him to much of a injury factor bad enough that Jabari is always injured.
D rose needs to go but he's not the problem ITS PHIL JACKSON
hayward would be great in the east  honestly
I actually AM curious what JaVale will do. He's finally found a home with Golden State but you have to wonder if someone will offer him more than what the Warriors can.
I'm a Heat fan
James Johnson is a beast, his talent is definitely there he jus needs to really breakout & I definitely want Waiters back.. Pat Riley would be a fool to let them both go
as a heat fan I want both James and Dion back but also want the heat to try and get Hayward in miami
i really hope dion and james johnson both stay in Miami... PLZZZ
We need Johnson and waiters on the heat
D Rose to the Mavs
love James Jonson
hell no rose should go to the Buck's the Knicks should sign George hill
Dion and Johnson Stay #HeatLifer
Dion and Johnson Stay #HeatLifer
D-Wait & JJ both are staying with heat...
I'm not a Knicks fan, I'm a drose fan, but I don't want him in New York.. it's too toxic and the upper management makes ridiculous decisions. Please, go to the Bucks for the love of god.
Jrue Holiday back to the Sixers  Who's with me
Paul George the biggest one missed
My boy James Johnson has to stay with the Heat!😭😭
I do want Rose back, but thisvteam is so disfunctional that I prefer him going somewhere else where he could succeed
Hope D.Rose go to bucks and pelicans
James and dion need to come back we don't need a superstar these 2 are so great #heatnation
I think Millsap or even Monroe would be a great addition for the Wizards. Gortat with his slow ass offers nothing offensively and get bullied on the defensive end.
The yezzys look dirty on the bottom but I thought they were new
It's like when you go camping and you need a fire going you just burn your shoes
https://www.gofundme.com/kcs-jordan-fund PLEASE FUND
I like Chance and Anthony but this video is fake. Jake was clearly in on it because on his vlogs he got those shoes days ago and that would make sense since the bottoms are dirty. Do ACTUAL pranks
I know this video is kinda fake, but can we compare Jake's reaction to burning a pair of shoes and Stan's reaction to destroying his car :(
HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANTHONY
Happy BDay mannnnn!! (Anthony)     -Adam
Those were lit😂😂
That was so fake how could he not see the brow bottoms
idk but they said the yeezys were brand knew but they looked dirty from the bottom🤷🏻‍♀️ anyways I still love all in team 10!!!😽
Burning even just the box is hurting my soul
check out my vids and subscribe for 10 years of good luck😎
fake Pablo Merch
what about brohions or ohians
they were acting the whole thing tho........
Yo I know were team ten house is
This video is staged cause he had his yeezys already they were worn so he pretended as if they barely came in the mail & the sole is like black cause they are used so I guess it could've been better
Me when I see the title "that's not a prank... that's murder"
But he used the shoes before
It's not fair there his new ones
just jocking
im never subscribing and im telling my friends not too
Ya need a new intro and outro
can I get more subscribers for my birthday
OMG me and Anthony have the same b-day
Who named your fans?
if that was jake he would burn the real yezzy's
Look at the bottom of the shoes it's fake
Happy birthday Anthony xxxx
Jake look behind your red motorcycle picture there's another mavrick
already 20 on trending
MAY 4TH IS ANTHONY'S B-DAY!! HAPPY B-DAY
You still burnt the box I would've kept the box forever just to keep my zeezys in
Okay but Ray is also a snack 😍😛
Why almost everyday
Chanthions merch soon???
Ur guys are awesome!
Very YEasy to burn
This Anthony dumbass kept on pointing the phone towards the box when chance was trying to switch them up. He was pissing me off.
Chance you like Tessa and she likes you. Get on with it
who cares he has like 40 billion pairs of shoes and he's rich so... like if u agree
Do a normal vlog not just pranks
that was a set up prank because the bottom of the yeezes where dirty but I'm still a jake pauler
At least they do real pranks
LOL this is so planned . The only ones who believe this is real are all the 12-13 year old fan's. Bottom shoes are dirty and omg that acting is the worst.
why would you pay 2k$ for some used shoes?!?😑
Lol they burned some white converses
Can somebody please take away the acetone from the team 10 house?!??😂
Its funny that jake wore those yeezys 4 days ago at the disney awards thing and that the sole on the yeezys was black due to use, fake your pranks better i would say...
jake paul could buy so many of those they are the cheapest yeezys to be released
revenge is sweat
Noooo you should call us brohios
I'm sorry that I said I hate u guys  I thought it was real because I saw the middle of the video and then wrote this
sorry i thought those were kadens
Wow jake ur a really bad actor and and to think that you are on a Disney chanel show
They are kades
Good acting.
those weren't his kaden let him borrow those
U have a black thing on ur camera
this prank is fake look aat the bottom of the yezzys (used)
ur dumb for putting is yeezys on fire
y'all need to make your vlogs longer
Hey watch my new video :) share n subscribe
is it just me orrrrr do you guys not like the fandom name either? lol
ULTRA WHITE LMAO ITS TRI WHITE

You know you big when you make Googles main page congratulations.
out of curiosity, and maybe this has already been explained, but what is this money going toward that everyone is donating? and/or why are people doing it?
Do not care for the drunk videos. Sorry......
Can you say   " WASTED ".
This was probably your most fun high drinking, low betting video you've done yet.  :)  If you are in Vegas May 23 - 25th, I'll try to catch you at one of the casinos.  I'm going for my birthday.
Had some beers while watching, it felt like I was there partying with you guys. Awesome.
So funny..love your gambling style...enthusiasm mostly..
Brian why aren't you using your players card?  Continuing to watch now.
there is a telephone number for your gaming addiction  this is pathetic  making YouTube videos on gambling   what a waste for YouTube   encouraging people to gamble   u make me sick
Great to see you both having so much fun whilst making this video for us all to watch. Yes Marco is cute but you are HOT Brian. Besos
Do you ever run into VegasLowRoller when you're out at the casinos?  How is he in person?
It was great to finally see Marco. :)

What a good sport lmao
If you look closely you can see the white devils fangs and forked tongues as theyre cackling. 
Sounds more like a rape scene by a maniac than a laughter :D
Insanity. I love it! ha

A bass, lol
Why were they cutting her off? That was the best interview ever.

The Roses in the Guns was so symbolic as o what the world is dealing with today! There's so much hate and controversy... Just put the guns and hate down and live a little. Spread life, not death.

It was so much fun filming this Blippi video on the ranch!
Excited to see how the movie is going to come out. Casey you once said to me "its not the equipment its how you use it"
vlog is back. good edit
First off that music mix was the best!!! Secondly, how awesome is that natural light in So-Cal?! This video has me itching to back to Cali!
For a second I thought Casey was gonna be a guest on the H3 Podcast and I got really excited
The new time lapse b-roll, wit the slow to real time and then the camera pickup is dope!
that beach boys music though!
Since u call this the real reality (comparing to tv) how about instead of calling them season 1.2 3... winter 2017.. spring 2017....
Samsung is smart. They know these videos are ads just like the one that will air on TV
Hey Casey ! What happen to the big Samsung S8 Comercial
New lesson learned; location, location, location.
Awesome you shared this with will! Seems like a good dude
Casey your camera is GH5?
But he still gets first class on a regular plane... lol
If this vlog was filmed with those Samsung camera-phones, it could be the commercial. (Well, a 14 minute one...)
Palm Springs is an awesome place to visit I have been their 4 or more times and it was amazing each time.

I wish I had even just a vestige of the life you live. Not easy to chase your dreams; giving up on mine. Congrats man. That's freakin awesome.

Why do so many helicopter pilots turn transgender, be carful Casey.
"It's not the equipment, it's how you use it". Well it does it really apply when the way you use it is infinitely more expensive than your actual equipment?

This is why I want you make a company that is super successful and at the same time be able to Vlog my day. Daily.
Taht dude looked liked he was on some major cocaine
And here is the very first Trailer for "The Dark Tower".
Sorry. But where is Eddie?
Awesome video
Anyone notice the reference to The Shining?
looks awesome
are they fucking kidding me ? WHAT...THE...FUCK...IS...THIS..SHIT ?!
I get older, they... stay the same age.
"You'll like earth - a lot"  Such riveting dialogue, that they had to stop the music. Riveting.
Aw HELL YES!!
HEIMDALL OPEN THE BIFROST!
this is a bad trailer it makes the movie seem like another generic movie you'll forgot right after watching I hope I'm wrong and it's good though
Idris what grunty name.
wtf! he fought against walter?!?!?! walter make him sleep with just move a few finger, then leave him at beach. yea its the end of 1. book.  fuck you movie! ı bet you gonne kill walter end of the movie.
Better not fuck this up Hollywood!!
I was looking forward to Roland and jakes epic trip through the mountains,jakes poem of the truth,sucks.
Idris (the moaning annoying bastard) Elba
0:43 the Overlook hotel from The Shining
All the butthurt racists...sigh
Press "thumbs up" if you believe I should read the book before seeing this movie.
FINALLY some black heroes to hell with James Bond this is way better
oh look! its Matthew McConaughey playing Matthew McConaughey...again
"LAST ACTION HERO" a kid pulls a hero out of one world and into present day NY.
The music is from For a Few Dollars More
FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE watch song
Looks Epic, the way he loads his gun on 2:17 is HELLA!!!
187 lockdown the gunman
Sheesh I thought it looked pretty cool seeing as how I haven't read the books then I look at the comments and WhaBAM instant tomfoolery... It can't be THAT bad can it?
So Paul Reubens is playing Al Simmons in the new Spawn right?  C'mon guys you gotta commit here!
Pretty much a standard forgettable  summer movie. Thats a shame.
Another shitty adaptation.
looks like hopsin in the thumbnail
i don't kill with my gun,I kill with my heart😃😃😃
"Its you .... you're a gun slinger right?"  "No....... I'm the real James Bond!"
I know this was supposed to be based off of some beloved book but it doesn't really look like anything special. It just looks like another one of those throwaway movies that comes out in January.
He's not supposed to be black. This is a character created by the legendary Stephen King, you cannot implant your SJW bullshit here
I do not aim with my hand :)
seriosly ? this is atrocious. There are infinite worlds and there are doors to them. And the dark tower reigns over those world. Like a rose. I will scream "fuck you" if they ruin this.
looks great...   I don't know why but every time a movie is a based on a book... every readers say the movie is shit... glad I don't read much... I can enjoy the movies
I'm super excited to see this new version of Roland's quest for the tower.  I hope this is going to be rated R, because the books are in my opinion.
Miscast ... That is not Roland. Another book destroying piece of crap.
GOOD FUCKING MORNING! IT'S MUTHA FUCKING SHAKE TIME! GODDAMNIT!!
Best ADC ever!
I'm not a racist at all. But to respect material they should have remembered that the inspiration for the gunslinger was Clint Eastwood for Gods sake!
This is shit >:(
john wick vs the gunslinger ha. but no this movie looks really good. unique concept.
My reaction to the trailer relates to the comments.  You white people are so predictable.  Especially when you get insecure.
looks so awesome!
Epicness, thy name is Idris Elba.
You know why he's black? 'Cause it's a DARK tower movie....     Heh, get it?
the hotel from The Shining has a little cameo at 0:43
Well this is gonna suck.
LOL 2017 SHIT for Faggot generation!!! WTF is with the same type of trailers YAWN and the Harry Potter music....coz its a book get it, LOL -
next black panther from marvel  will be played by brad pitt, oh I forgot it is only racist when whites do it....btw I am not white so fuck off
this is bullshit roland is white not black
How could u possibly dislike this trailer?
name of the end song its the best part of all trailer haah
Another english twat putting on an america accent .......
IT'S HIGHNOON!!!
why the fuck a black actor?
Already love it !!!!! Finally something new !!!!
The one movie were they replace a white character with a black character and the internet goes crazy. Thousands of other movies whitewashing, but this can't be accepted. Lol the world today
Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice here goes you black-washing. A white character turned back because FUCK YOU this is the SJW age now.
This looks like it might be an interesting movie!  However, this is nothing like the Dark Tower, and that is what I am upset about! (and I am someone who has read all of the novels!)
Needs a Trailer with a blues rendition of Hey Jude playing.
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what is the end credit song title?
Too epic even for a Trilogy.
@0:43 you see the real Overlook Hotel from The Shining.
combines two of my favourite things; Idris Elba being badass and revolvers.
I'm definitely reading the books O.O  this looks awsm
Not sure if ill be able to see Matthew M. as an antagonist.... but worth a try I guess.
Yeehooo! this looks good!
0:32 hotel from "the shining"?
Where's the hat?
Always thought of Roland as at least 50, old dude, all used an abused by the land and the life. This guy doesn't look a day over 40.
LOL - the music - seriously?
am i suppose to be excited for this
Hey  pal! ! every Anybody  identify one's better  this videq  omg...
Death alwayz, winz
looks like a really good film. Shame that we've seen everything in the trailer...
loved how Stephen King universe is slowly developing ... hoping for more of his works :*
this looks shit.
1:53 damn... wish COD could reload that fast
The kid in me wants to see this
How can i find the music box name?? pls help searching it for 9 years
The Trump Tower. Coming August
the kid destroys it. even Idris Elba can't help here
As a huge fan of the books I have got to say . . . this looks like shit
Of course he can see everything, hes heimdall.
May your days be long on this Earth.
the last line of the trailer = guns dont kill people, people kill people
Was the Roland white in book? Am i wrong?
Trailer wasn't that great until the end
I will absolutely watch this movie. Idris Elba's amazing acting and Mattew McConaughey's creepy old man poltergeist voice. This movie has won my heart!! So happy to see Elba in a star role!
Matthew McConaughey is a good actor 👍
the type of movie that make us desperate for sequel.
maybe i am t he only one who found the trailer "BORING"
Ennio Morricone soundtrack from For a Few Dollars More, anyone?
Damn we finally get a Black héroe
They use OST from 'For a few dollars more'. Nice Touch.
Allright . Allright . Allright
Q. where does he get his bullets?
Must be real freaky for actual therapists when an earthquake happens in a session with a guy who claims he's Zeus or something
Where's the Man in Black String?!
The Dark Tower In Name Only.
no one noticed that tune from For A Few Dollars More?
Damn! That was good.
the men in black doing his best  T-bag impression lol
This is just an excuse for Idris Elba to do cool gun loading things
I honestly should just stop watching trailers... This spoiled so much. God damn it.
THIS GUY IS A COMBINATION BETWEEN  WESLEY SNIPES & DENZEL WASHINGTON REALLY BAD ASS...
who else is watching this just for McConaughey
i wait it for a long time, and my dream comes true. it will be on the screen.
388 people have forgotten the face of their fathers...
Looks awful
Never read the book but this does look pretty awesome
The Gunslinger vs John Wick, who do you think would win?
"I kill with my heart"..... would've loved it if he had ended that with a ".....huh?"
Makes me cry. I don't know why.
oh my god. mr.king would love it
yeah I don't get the hype surrounding this movie...this looks like the type of movie that came out in 2005 with all the cringe and immature movies
PLEASE let this be more _"Shawshank"_ and less _"Mangler"_. 🙏🏻  (*Side Note*: The trailer isn't quite what I was expecting, however, it surely doesn't disappoint.)
The kid was say he saw a Blackman..The counseling answer it.."Will Smith'
he got ban from siege coz of hax now he's protecting the dark tower and use hax :V
Idris Elba auditioning for James Bond role here
Looks like trash. Elba isnt suited to be Roland plain and easy. Adapting the books isnt impossible  because they said the same damn thing to Lord of the Rings.
this guy have haki.. usopp better watchout
Am I the only one who thinks...       Nothing.
Is that Heimdall? Oh Come On Man!
for a few dollars more the musical pocket watch  tune \m/ ..Brilliant tune adaptation :)
anyone know the name of the original background tune of the trailer? it was a fairly popular 90s track... cant seem to remember!
THIS IS SO FKING COOL
He is like devil. No he is wore.He is Matthew McConaughey..
great cast, i mean, Matthew mcconaughey? idris elba? definitely looks promising to me.
Im calling it right now, the boy is Matthew McConaugheys son
how poor forehead challenge plenty protective vs gentle.
where is 19?
ghost rider friend ...
"We fix everything with war and guns are cool" the movie
the gate to asgard is unguarded!!! thor must be pissed.
Alright, alright, alriiiight... Apocalypse at the black tower tonight...
alright alright alright
The last 40 seconds definitely saved this trailer.
This looks like Time Bandits -- 90s xtreme version.
You better get back and protect Asgard wtf.
my fav writer and my fav book. bring it on. hell of movie excitement at peak. Thanks makers or producers for making this epic venture.
Wonderful things happen when you give Luther guns. Real fancy gun-slingerin there Detective chief inspector :)
Elba is such a badass dude
"I do not kill with my gun, I kill with my- *bullet hits a bird instead* DAMNIT!"
All I know is the #Michael #Whelan book covers are to coolest paintings and this tower looks a little meh so far. I'm sure it will be a great movie though.
I kill with my heart in batman voice
Idris Elda will should play as John Stewart, the black-skinned green lantern.
I think they made a mistake trying to put all of it into one movie
Music is the theme from For a Few Dollars More. Also yeah, The Shining reference.
I kill with my heart ...that's cheesy as fuck....i bet you this is the only scene that's watchable in the whole thing
why can't Hollywood do Stephen King properly? :(
The thumbnail looks like the greatest nba player

You are so pretty and I love the sound of your voice !!!
I'm based in Hove. Message me if you need anything!
I'm so excited for you about moving to Brighton! :-) I would like to see what your hometown looks like, though. Would you consider vlogging a bit? :-)
Dont put ireland down  its a beautiful place
Girl boss! yes I love it!
ARE YOU NOT SAD THAT YOU'RE LEAVING YOUR MOM IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY ON HER OWN? She'll be so alone
you might get to meet the "family fizz" a vlogger vegan family who just moved to Brighton !
I binge watched girl boss in one day haha, I don't feel guilty about it either 😂
This is the first video of you that I'm watching. The fact that you think about getting an older cat instead of a kitten for the mentioned reasons makes you sooooo likeable! Subscribed. :)
Iam sorry where are you moving? Too
Love the red killing it!! Also, my name is Arabella woo!!!!
I know what you mean about missing study, I graduated high school in 2015 and 6 months later I had to enrol into more study just because 😂 I'm now finishing this study and feel a bit lost
I didn't know you had a youtube channel! So happy to find it - you're so cute!
I moved to Brighton later last year for university & I swear it has been the best thing I've ever done in my life. Wish you all the best in your move here, so excited for you!☺️ x
First you decide to ADOPT a cat and second you might get an ADULT cat? You are amazing girl ! I love your mind set
My dream car is either a BMW or an all black Range Rover
Hi what highlighter do you use it's a lovely shine
I was so against Jonathan and Anna moving to london because it would changes them.  I really like their simple life in Ireland.  😔
I didn't start watching you till a couple of days ago and I'm obsessed with your channel you are so pretty and you have such a good and enjoyable personality x
My dream car is a mint green Fiat 500... and three years ago I purchased her 😍 she's called Fifi Fudge the Minty Queen 💚
U look soooo like Anna your sister u too are so buteyful😱😌
Love the Maryland sweatshirt! Go terpsssss 🐢
You look so like Anna in this video!
Is she Anna saccones sister?
girlboss is great. watched it as soon as it came out
That lipstick looks absolutely stunning on you xx you should wear red more often x
I love learning!!
I watched a few minutes of this , but on the behalf of the country, we thank you for leaving.
I get it, I miss learning so I'm doing a masters O_O History though! I approve 👍
Are you Anna's sister?  I've never saw your channel before.
Love your sweatshirt!!  Terps!!!!
Range Rover Evoque in white or black ❤
Love the outro music!!
U should study fashion your style is amazing
I am a small YouTuber. I vlog with my son. Your sister and Jonathan inspired me to vlog. I would love to reach a boarder crowd for our channel and being more creative as well.
YEESSS I loved girlboss I watched all of the episodes within 3 days
The RSPCA cat and dog rescue centre at Patcham in Brighton is a great place to adopt a cat 😺

I should be revising for the 3 exams I have in the next few weeks
Any small channels want to help each other out? 💕 subscribe and ill subscribe right back lovelies 💕
im called jason and people call me jace , im also going to call my kid jace

I'm getting distracted by this from my homework but this is more important. xx
how come Anna and Jonathon & co. dont mention in your favourite YouTuber????
I loveee the way you say saccone 😂💜
Your accent is just so 😍😍
I live like 20 mins from Brighton but I go to college in Brighton! It's such a cool, creative place and you could do practically anything and no one will judge you! I'm sure you'll love it here :)
Can we get a tour of your new place when you move in please
Highly. Recommend open university!
noooooooo Ireland is the best!!!! hahah don't move lols
Any Irish kinda insulted when she said she wants to leave the entire country?😂 Like why aren't we good enough?😢 ps: obviously I'm joking and I completely get why she's moving, but still😂
Have a look at open University stuff. You can also just do a history course without making a degree and you still study by yourself but have provided materials
Love you so muchhhh!!!!!!🦄your amaze balls Please reply! Your actually such an inspiration
SO obsessed with Girl Boss- watched them all in like 3 days hahah! so funny!
Little bit more and you will bet one of his car from Jonathan and Anna ;)
Little bit more and you will bet one of his car from Jonathan and Anna ;)

How The Fuck is This Trending?
take your like my good friend...
This for real made my day! 😂👌🏽
I think the border wall will work just fine.
Oh my god its Jason Bourne
Thats amazing
Lol, well made me laugh
Is it just me or is there no net on the goal 0.o
"Hey MOM! Im spiderman"
Nob. was a shit goal too
i love disneyland and california adventure and i am a pass holder but i avoid weekends like the plague.
It's probably busy because there was a music festival for middle and high school and the awards were given out in the park that night
Was busy all Week!
In my friends backyard smoking weed lol Or the mall of this huge outdoor shopping center with a movie theartre lol
Along the Wasatch Front in Utah we're next to the mountains. Friday's would always be Bon Fire night up the Canyon.
You have some much loved fan 💗
Man that tower sucks lol sorry it just sticks out way too much
On Friday nights my friends and I would hang out on the stoop after work. We would buy snacks and just sit and talk almost all night. ( by stoop I mean front steps to our homes, I'm from NY lol)
grad night??  or is it still too soon? since this was shot in april id assume im wrong
corn dog Castle is closed because they are putting a cashier just like the garden grill and then walk up to the window to get your food.
was this the day after johnny depp showed up on the pirates ride
Well for me during high school on most Friday evenings I hung at home and did nothing.
Gosh Liz is so pretty !! So youthful looking
Corn dog Castle is under refurbishment for another week or so. The Paradise Grill menu is just the Corn dog Castle menu until the refurbishment is done.
If I lived close enough, I would definitely have a yearly pass- going there in the evening looks like so much fun
Ahhhhh that looks so good! I hope they still have it when I go in two weeks!
We hung out in the Burger King parking lot.
Tbh DCA seems to have a better selection in their menu's
Liz talking about the winnetka theater and the northridge mall hits close to home shoutout to the valley the only place where you can be in 110 degree weather and be bored because there's nothing to do
we would hangout at the mall or other shopping centers. Probably see a movie or go to eat.
Funny how Touring Plans also uploaded a video on the C&W skewer; they did not approve at all 😅. I would definitely try it myself.
hahah on friday nights we used to get drunk and go on late adventures to abandoned places i dont suggest anyone copy this especially you little muffins out there
Omg I see myself in this video walking by myself! I saw you guys but was too shy to say hi haha
Liz eyes will have you hypnotized Dave is one lucky men. #cutecouple
next time can you guys film inside the shops at Disneyland to check out all the Graduation items 🤔☺️
I now have a headache. lol Hate gotg takeover of ToT. What an ugly eyesore too.
What happened with that other video it was acting all weird on me.
They should bring Muppets back if all they're going to do with that building is show movie trailers.
Roscos anyone
That chicken and waffle skewer looked soo good! Just another thing to add onto the "food to eat at Disney" list
when I lived in calif I hung out at the skate country in city of industry ca or the Puente hills mall (twin pines) I moved out of cali. when I was 14 and then the mall was 80 miles away
I was there on Saturday at Disneyland. I didn't get to meet all of you guys, but I saw Ian and said hi. I think I startled him though 😂
I'm really liking the intro music anyone know if it's custom or if it goes with another song?
I would hang out at Disney in high school😭🤷🏽‍♀️ or the Santa Monica Pier
I did have an AP in high school so I was at DL on Friday nights. Or the mall. Or Tower Records.
How come you removed the first uploaded one?
Did anyone else noticed the elevator in the shaft go up & down?
because​ I had my grad night at Disney back in 2002
oh good - wanted to watch earlier but it said it wasn't avail. - good!  of course it's busy - rumors of Johnny Depp and Fresh Baked crew in the park! :)
Beep Boop! (Fresh Baked!)
Liz! Roscoe's Chicken and waffles has a new location near Disneyland.
it's probably grad night
FINALLY!!!  Been waiting with baited breath!  That's how much I love these videos!  :)
That chicken waffle on a stick looked soooo good!
winnetka theater! lol

Love this video
In Africa, Every 1 minute passed is 60 seconds.
this video is so original and creative
that was way quick
even the video ended in one minute lol👏💯☺🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😜
I like the video and all, but there's no reason it had to be a minute long. It would've been better if Mitch talked slowly enough for us to actually understand without a problem what happens in a minute
it should be "what happens in one minute in one minute"
And one AsapSCIENCE video is made. (Sorry if someone already commented this)
and guess what else ia one minute ..........                    the video bravo
I think science beats Emenem
what did mothers feed their babies before humans  became lactose tolerant?

I have a question ! Will having an energy drink before an exam boost performance or is it a bad idea? What is best to drink/eat otherwise?
I'll never think of a minute the same in my life
I was gonna complain about how fast you were talking... took me a minute to get the gag.
*Looks at title* "Huh, cool, I'm gonna click this." *Looks at video duration* ";–;  Wow, the video is even 1 minute.." *Watches video* ">:C  Damn, they're dumb. In actual reality, 60 seconds happens."    *Thug Lyfe*
Umm I didn't understand anything 😂😂😂
Make a video on what happens in 1 second
I have a queston to ask is homework really necessary
I have a queston to ask is homework really necessary
😑 you don't have to make the video 1 minute to prove your point! 😒
And i can waste another minute on youtube
I like the fact that this video is a minute long
omg the video is exactly 1 minute wowooowowowowo okay bye
african children could have eaten them minutes how dare you waste them... 
Wow that was amazing
This is like a one minute rap song😂
instead of trying to fit as many useless facts as you can in one minute, you could've spent some time drawing a helpful conclusion from this data
Just amazing.
I went so fast!
83.33 Terrawatts aren't energy but power. Energy needs to be calculated in power times duration being Joules [J] or more intuitive Watthours [Wh].
Surely the Sun contribution should be in Joules not Watts? Terrawatts of energy isn't really a thing
Wow, Mitch, ur voice is fast in this video
Do you know? In Africa, every 60 secs passed = 1 mins passed
What happens in a minute? Well it's definitely not a Minute Physics video.
But i commented in that 1 min...
I have a question. Will there ever be a point in existence where there is absolutely no sound/has there been?
This is intereveffsbdnfjfycvfggjvyyvjgjygukgkursgdhgytgdrfdgfghhgfhmkuh sorry there was an ant on my screen and I had to kill it! Pesky little ant 🙃

The only reason why Lil Yachty doesn't remember the last time he was wrong because hes a crack head.
iSpy with my little a turd on my porch with a Hamburger

omFgosh SCOOBY!!!!!
THANK GOD I JUST GOT DARKSIDERS FOR FREE AND DARKSIDERS II FOR 2.83 AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS  *Heavy breathing*  Sorry.
She is way too calm and cool to be called "Fury" ffs!
she is pestilence or Death ?
I have to go alone...
This looks ...  interesting, to say the least.
Dat horrible face though.
can't fkn wait...
It's happening... HOLY SHIT IT'S HAPPENING!!! *struggles to control breathing*
Such an underrated series, and I had feared it was dead! Love live the four horseman!
Yes. YES. YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS! COME TO PAPA!
this is cool a female protagonist. the first 2 were fun
Yessss and in Darksiders 4, we can play as Strife! In like...5 years
FINALLY!!!!
YYYYEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHH!!!
All these recently female protagonists just seem like feminism  got women quotas for gaming
*E X T R A T H I C C*
Finally! I love Darksiders 1 and 2 and I'm ready for more!
how can i go to deep sleep and wake up in 2018?  pls say? i knew for sur ethere woitn be a DS3....but this is like a dream come true what about Death comeback ? Pun intendeddddddddddd
I had heard that Darksider wasn't gonna get another sequel. I'm glad I was wrong.   She looks kindof like a Blizzard character, though.
Don't like her design but glad to see the series make a return, will definitely check it out.
Don't like the main character
WAAAHOOOOO!!!!!!!
Great ..i've played the first two good games i can't wait for this one and a female character too awesome. the first two were badass, so it's time for a sexy change.
OoO FINALLY
Everyone is whining about the design but it's exactly what she looks like in the Hellbook Edition. So yeah, despite the new developer team, it's still the same source material
I thought it was Famine :c  are they not going by War, Death, Famine and Conquest/pestilence?
The four horseman of the apocalypse are supposed to be Conquest, War, Death, and Famine. What a wasted opportunity.
I've been waiting for this moment for so long. Hell hath no fury like Fury scorned.
Aw crap. I can wait five more years to play as him again
BLADE WHIP BLADE WHIP BLADE WHIP!!!!!   Swoon. I'm so stoked, thank you so much for this!!!!!
i cannot believe it darksiders is actually back
"They are Seven and you only One" Fury: Only Seven………Easy
for those who don't know... the ORIGINAL rider of the black horse is Famine...so that would technically make strife pestilence, famine and pestilence got turned into fury and strife for this franchise
I can easily die after seeing this
*fangirling scream intensifies*
Finally I left darksiders 3 after playing the darksiders 2 and 1 and I am Spanish only that I am translating in English but well the game is very cool xd
Huh. Went from horsemen of the apocalypse to Jessie from team Rocket. Still pumped for this game though!
War still can't catch a break.
when i saw 2018 i was like ( -_- )
Was praying that the series continued!
1:20 pricess of persi of bugysoft😱😱😱
1:20 princess of persia dark from boogisoft is that wtf lollllll 🐯🐯🐯🐯
At last. I can't wait :)
she looks badass (a bit of an arcana katrina from LoL though)
Super Excited that Darksiders 3 is finally going to be a thing.  Super Disappointed in this terrible trailer.
yo I thought ds 3 was never going to come out
That was definitely an Aside Glance at 1:13!
HYPEEEEEEEEEEEEE
why a girl?
This trailer is very poorly optimized, this was the worst trailer of 2017, people look at these graphics, horribly honestly, 2012 resolution, sorry to speak, but from what I have seen in 2017, this is too bad ...
She Inherited her beauty from her mother.
ivy from soul calibur gets her own game? neat.
Her Face is way tooo cartoony ... this does not really fit ... :/
this trailer gave me a stiffie.
I am impressed she looks more covered than the original design.
My wallet is going to get bankrupt by the end of this year.
Touch nothing but the lamp!! Anyone else think of Aladdin with this intro?
*_uncontained sexual monaing_*
so wait...War gets captured again? The council said the seals were broken which only happened at the end of 1
no lie, fury is a terrible sister. at least death tried to help his brother
Hopefully Vulgrim continue as a merchant,  his interaction with Fury will be interesting
YESSSSSSSSS YESSSSS I NEVER THOUGHT THIS COULD BE OMG YESSSS TO ALL OF IT YES
so I'm guessing this'll take place around the same time Death was mucking about trying to bring back humanity
Finallyyy :) been waiting for this game ................. thumbs up !!!!
A female :(
Im crying in joy now :') :')
so we will get a sequel in 2030? 2 & 3 are prequels or sidestories... 4 will possibly be too.... I want a sequel with 4 of them... 😂🔫
Am I the only one who's noticed all the "am I the only one" comments.
Its finally coming  I am not dreaming right..?? right??
get ready for the SJWs to say she is too sexy and its being straight is haram
OMG YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!
OMG is this real life !!!!!!!!
Shame we won't be getting a real horseman this time around.
Death is still the best horsemen
is the main character pestilence
Fury? Not pestilence or Famine?
Soooo..... what happened to Death?
Finally They returned! !!
i cant wait omg

Like most movies they blew their budget on the visual effects and had no money for better casting.
Wow is it really real
This is funny since 2 days ago I watched King Kong: Skull Island and the same day i downloaded Power Rangers: Legacy Wars.
thank God bless your family and God
thank goodness for you and your wife is at work and my lips 😍😍 I

Great new video. Nice Video Well Done..
lovely video.
We need Christian's social accounts 😭😂😂
2:50 isnt that nigahigas girl?
i only got 2 wrong maybe i should become a bartender
I'm 26 and the damn 15 year old looks older than me. how the hell. I swore she was at least 23 😂
I don't know how the bartenders were fooled by Kennedy. As soon as walked out you can just tell she's under 21. I actually guessed that she was 19. There's just something about her that says that's she's trying to hard.
i could tell that kennedy chick was underage the moment i saw her
America's drinking age is so crappy, man. Like almost all other countries have lower drinking ages.
only got 2 wrong I rock
The girl in the blue shirt looks so much like caroline from tvd to me lol
how is this one girl 15.  i am 14 and i look like a burned baby chicken nugget xD
when under aged for you means under 17-18 but american's mean 21...
7/10, maybe I should bartend 
UM IS ANYONE ELSE STILL SHOOK ABOUT THAT GIRL BEING 15 WHEN SHE LOOKS OVER 18
I think in europe is way easier because our legal drinking age here is around 18 and you can tell the difference way more.
15 ___:___  whattttt
that bianca chick legit looks like that poppy
In Australia the legal drinking age is 18
Bianca is 15?! lol she looked over
BITCH SHE WAS 15?
The one who is 15 you can tell is 15
omg someone had the same name as meee
3:36 Omfg, that woman would make a wonderful Morticia Addams. Hawt damn!  Go figure, she's 15.  I used to get drunk at one Japanese restaurant on the regular when I was 14, so I'm not super surprised.
how are some of them 18 and 19? I'm 19 and compared to them i look 14, wtf
I'll be 30 next month and get carded 4 out of 5 times. Especially if I'm alone.
I'm 20 and I always get told I look like a 14 year old which kinda pisses me off but when I turn 21 I can't wait to be carded and prove everyone wrong and have people stare weird when I have a drink in public :P
that girl was 15??? I'm 16 and look 12
Drinking age of 21? What is wrong with this country
I got 8/10 and I've never bartended
damnn y'all roasting that 15 yo kid
aaaand they all got fired after this video lol
The 15 year old looks like a fuckin vampire. Dracula ass bitch
Bianca is 15?!? I'm 15 and look like trash!
Aye I'm lucky I live in Australia 18 and up is Legal
This is what I like to classify as B U L L S H I T . Fix it...
I knew Khoe was about 25 as I also look young for my age but am of legal age
now guess who is at the legal age of consent
I got every single one right. You gotta look at the faces for the girls, and then for the guys it's more the clothing that they choose, or go with almost the opposite of your instinct.
Dude I'm fifteen and that one fifteen year old looks crazy old holy shit
Why was this in my recommend for? I've been watching Native American videos for the past month, and if not that then Anime on crack.
Bro, I'm 16 and don't look like that 15 year old did. I thought she was in her 20's. I have a baby face and all still and she walked out like a gothic model.
This was weird because i forgot the drinking age in america is 21 not 19
Drinking age 18 here fuck yall
when your 19 and legal in your country!
When I realize the fifteen year old is one year older than me... I'm shook
"I don't know anyone over 29 that still bites their nails"  my brother still does and he's 21 yikes
Woman: she looks young to me
How tf didn't they not know Kennedy was under 21????? She's a THOT
"Bianca, 15" IM SHOOK
There's fakes for a reason
How was that girl 15?????
I'm about 30 and no one believes I am over 15/16 Lol except when I do adulty stuff in which case they almost don't believe 18+! 👶🏼👧🏼
That 15 year old surprised me..I was thinking 19 lol
BIANCA IS GORGEOUS OH MY LORD
is patty single though? #dayum
"She looks like she seen some shit" LMAO
jeez that girl Bianca is so tall being only 15
You see why it's hard for guys to ask a random girl out. She can be under 18 or over 30 and you wouldn't be able to tell.
I found myself! My name is Marina but she was twice my age so...
Bianca looked like she didn't want the be there honestly 💀
BIANCA IS 15 WHAT THE HEEEhahaha
Almost everyone here is saying that the legal drinking age for Americans is too old
Thank God the drinking age in Canada is 19
Lol my mom bites her nails and she's 51.
The guy in the white is cute and I got them all right LOL
bianca does not look 15 what the FUCK
lmao when you're twelve and get them all right
that fist pump though, so cute!! he looks like the virgin media adverts' baby
IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW GORGEOUS BIANCA WAS FUUUKKK MY 16 YEAR OLD ASS COULD NEVER EVEN HOPE TO LOOK THAT GRACEFUL
pretty sure the twenty year olds were probably about to turn twenty one soon
Grant Gustin would've been under 21 to everyone.
HOW WAS THAT BIANCA GIRL 15!!!!
I guessed correctly on pretty much all of them
LOLOLOLOLOL 21. Y'all can drink legally in the UK, tis great.
How is Bianca 15????
well the legal drinking age is 18 in England so...
WAIT MY NAME IS BIANCA AND IM FIFTEEN WTF WHY IS MY NEW TWIN IN THIS VIDEO
janell is so pretty :) 4:06
lol didn't realize it wasn't buzzfeed til the end. also, in Germany, the drinking age is +16
how tf was tht Bianca 15, I'm 15 and I look like a foetus!!
I got 7/10 right. but that 1 dude who was actually 18 just looks old af. Nowadays young kids like their grown adults.
i guessed the ages right 😂😂😂
In denmark you can drink at any age, your just not allowed to buy it before you're 18:))
They deliberately chose people who look older or younger than their actual age.
When you relise this isn't buzzfeed
is it bad that 'm 15 and  got 8 out of 10?
HOW WAS THAT GIRL 15 WTF IM 15 AND IM SHOOK
whats next porn actors thinks whos underage

F*CK THE DAILY MAIL!

somehow this video managed to make me hate snapchat more than i already did.. thank you
Snapchat's abysmal. Most social media is in my opinion. It's all just a shit pile of insecurity and stupidity
I hate social media. (With a very small amount of exceptions of course) Id rather listen to beeping door alarm from an 80's car then interact with any of them.
Honestly though snapchat is pretty awful
The *worst* thing about Snapchat is that "Send Nudes" shit. People how do that should be ashamed
Can ya ave a gander at Instagram
Have you done an Elementary school relationship video because UUURRGGH!
Do an I hate free giveaways vid
I hate fidget spinners pls

I hate phones, and I have no phone. I would rather have a new amplifier for my electric guitar. Technology such as the 'smart phone' is stupid.

Hey, here's a good one, "gOO fkig kll ur slf u pusy bich :D"
May you review cool math games? please.
I use snapchat to watch other people basically vlog their lives 10 seconds at a time. I have never used a filter and I have never looked at the news section.
I hate everything, GO THANK THE ODD1SOUT NOW. Becouse I discorvered you and subscribed because the odd1sout suggested it
you should do one on satisfying videos or try not to sing
Do "I Hate Instagram" I would enjoy that.
I have to agree
I love your videos! You're sarcastic and funny, and your videos are well made. I can't even make a good video myself, and I've agree with you on pretty much everything you've made for your videos so far. You're awesome👍
this is funny but true
U don't  hate snapchat, u hate the users of Snapchat
Listen to Xtrullor Hate Everything
For the next video on a social networking site it should be Instagram. Or what about Youtube?

Suggestion: I HATE SPORTS, or, I HATE WRESTLING.
I am so glad that I don't use my mobile phone at all. Heck, I am not even sure where it is right now.  Fuck this times and most of all: fuck the Millenials.
Snapchat is like the best social media right now, the filters and the streaks feature are amazing
the corgi using the dog filter was cute tho
Your intro triggers me to every morning having to wake up.
Please look at Google plus!
Hey dude, just discovered this shit and I have to say even though I like a few of the subjects you comment on (FNAF, Minecraft etc) I love hearing ur opinion on current subjects. Keep it up. You just earned a sub.
I think I'm gonna snap this to my friend
In a flash of short lived innocence, I genuinely forgot what muscial.ly was. Now I remember, that innocence shattered.  Thanks Alex.

I now want to watch this more than the last 8 Oscar nominated dreck bullshit films that I subjected myself to.
Bill is from the labyrinth review
I honestly loved this movie when I was younger.
Oh boy, Nostalgia Critic reviewing a movie with Alan Cumming in it is going to make him have "Son of the Mask" PSTD.
I loved seeing Bill in this. He contributes so much to this review and his backstory is really amazing.
Rougue One is a better precuel, the only one good.
6-7 shots  I took
3:42 I couldn't agree more
just realized thats the johnny Quest intro. now thats nostalgia!
I don't see what the problem is, I see Wilma perfectly fine and don't see the Third Rock connec- INCOMING MESSAGE FROM THE BIG GIANT HEAD!!!
Wilma's father was a Dictabird?
Do Drop Dead Fred!
'How many creampie misunderstandings before we learn our lesson?'  I laughed. Loud.
I dunno, let's check it out. Grand Dad?! Flintstones?! Awwgh! Grand Dad... Grand Dad! What the fuck?! Grand Dad?! Grand Dad! What the shit, Grand Dad?! Ohh, hahaha!
love ur movie review critic. make more
HEY CRITIC I HOPE DIE IN A FIRE WITH AVGN AND COBANERANI456/COBAMASAMA
Stop making homophobic remarks Critic! Reported  #FireCritic #Stopthehate
We'll have  a  gay ol' time
can you review trolls?
No more sketches. Please.
Is it me or the guy that wants dinosaurs killed looks like Sean Spicer?
AAAAAHHHHHH! BIODOME!
I TALKED JUST LIKE THIS
8:10. What the hell? That's just...contemptible. "Betty Rubble is drugged and date-raped by Bill Cosby." Why was this even put in?
Finally you've covered this! Does this mean your Titan AE review is just around the corner too?
As usual Doug is nit-picking the hell out of something that has long been irrelevent
Anybody who references Dino Riders gets +10 points in my book.
this prequel is almost as pointless as the oishi high school battles prequel.
"It's because of people like you there are 7 transformers movies!" I agree lol.
saw this movie and it taught me to be gay. so i prayed until itbwent away. but now i saw this again and now i was turned gay again. should i sue?
It looks like the flinstones are going to suck the nostalgia dick
GRAND  DAD GOES TO Viva Rock Vegas!
that's not the actor who plays the leprechaun....
Ok, so I saw this as a kid, but I had no idea it was a prequel to the other one.
According to wikipedia in stone age the had volcanic glass obsidian for sharp cutting tools so technically they had glass.
Aliens didn't exist in the dinosaur times.
I never noticed the "Glass" part in the drive in scene.  Nice Catch critic. =P
Please do Herbie Goes Bananas or Herbie Fully Loaded!
why do you FAGGOT have those long scatches??? we just want to see the review you ASSHOLE!
So this guy looks like Yahtzee, has an editing style similar to AVGN and isn't as good as either of them? well count me disappointed
How did you add the playlist listing for season 10 above the title?
Harvey korman was the voice of the Dictabird in the first film
Nostalgia Critic: "I'm saving myself for pauly shore." Me: "WE DON'T TALK ABOUT HIM!!!!" Nostalgia Critic: "He never recovered after the Star Wars Holiday Special." Me: "WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT MOVIE!!!!"
While not in the review-Jane Krakowski is a Broadway singer-which has to be shoehorned in everything she does, hence Betty is a singer in this, and never ever again!
So..in the future Barney's the smartest guy at his workplace, but in his youth he's borderline retarded?
Hot Fuzz, Inception and the Mask were fine movies
All hail to critic! Baaaanzaaaai!
Hey Critic , can you review Smurfs the lost village?
Your jokes hang too long! Cut away from your face faster, before it gets awkward!
This movie is a guilty pleasure of mine from my childhood!
I hated this movie
*FLEENSTONES??*
His intro gives me goosebumps
... I'm pretty nostalgic for the old Nostalgia Critic. Too bad he died and was replaced by the Reel Critic.
Instead of this ill-conceived sequel,they should've done the logical follow-up.... *The Jetsons* ! Joe Dante could've directed.
i think its more youl have a day ol time
This new intro is really bad in my opinion.Review on the other hand was nice :)
I just wonder what was going through Doug's, Malcolm's and Tamara's head when they were standing in those mosquito outfits in front of a green screen.
Really just really critic? You didn't put one single game of thrones reference into the review? Just why? Why? "He shouted WAIT WAIT!! They never tell you how they shit themselves."
The city should have been called "Las Pebbles"
8:23 hmmmmmmmmnmmmhmmmm
GRAND DAD! FLEENSTONZ?
Noooooooooooooo!!! Thomas Gibson get out of this movie! Oh God! This is like finding out the girl you liked in College had to whore herself out for tuition money! Blergh!!!!! *K.O.*
The first time I saw this movie I was like "Wow, Rosie O'Donnell lost half her body weight!"
Harvey Korman is in the movie because he was the original voice of the Great Gazoo
Sometimes i think i watch your review just for the music theme... Don't get me wrong, I love nostalgia critic - i'm just hooked on the theme ;)
7 Transformer movies? *pulls a gun at my head*
Apparently, the Union Jack existed in stone age times too.
oh. your logo is an satelite... I always thaught it was a studio light
I want more of those mosquitoes!
Holy sh*t, we're getting 7 Transformers movies?! *blows head off*
You should do "it's pat".
Dude needs to do X2. Imagine NC realizing Nightcrawler is Alan Cumming. He'll lose his sh*t!
I still hate that intro😡😡😡
the  review was dumber than the movie.    Movies based on kids' cartoons are meant to be goofy.
I'm surprised you didn't mention the multiple, contradicting ways Fred and Wilma met, this movie including.
8:09 holy fucking shit
the intro really looks like the real johnny quest adventures intro
That Mrs. Doubtfire cutaway about Joan Collins made me laugh more than it should have
12:30 Well I don't know about you guys but I found my new profile picture.
I used to love this film, I still do but I used to too
Alright, go ahead. Let's hear all the Grand Dad jokes...
FYI fred is King Robert Baratheon
This is basically "The Jetsons and the Flintsons Coexist" theory fanfic.
Lol that gangster dude looks nothing like bradgarett
I will defend the lever as being metaphorical. He tells the people to cheat or fix the machines.
Why is it that when 2 guys are friends, they have to have gay jokes about them? Its overdone and cheap writing.
Not even a commentary over the Union Jack clothes way before the UK even existed? Doug, this joke was jumping in front of you!
So... like... how did the Jetsons meet? :p
This is the first movie I saw as a kid that made me realize that movies could  be bad. Thanks for the memories Doug!
Intro reminds me of Johnny Quests opening
MORE JOYNATHAN
So for Episode 101 right, let's kick it off with some Outlast 2 Gameplay  :))
I want to eat the noodles!!!
I would love to see TSL goes to Singapore's most haunted location. maybe vlog style

Joyce secretly adding noodle to Jon's bowl is, in a sense, dispensing some sweet sweet poetic justice for the Christmas quiz prank payback.

Spicy challenge idea: Order mala (da-la) and add one packet of spicy ramen sauce :-)

After working with some nonprofit organizations I can honestly say it is very much like how this video implied
I found this to be too painfully accurate!
.... Not just the execs. ;)
Worklife balance? What is that? 
OMG! Sooooo true!
Favorite has to be, " Is there any food left over from that board meeting?"
Love that the guy in the stall has his pants pulled up...haha. 
I would starve if it weren't for the leftover food.
My favorite line is still - Did you see their 990!? Hilarious! :D 
"I love my job!"  "I hate my job!"  We nonprofit execs can all relate to that! 
I know - that was SO catty... HA :)
NICE!!!! I totally say so many of those - in fact just yesterday I wrote in an email, "So this is a no-cost sponsorship?" LOL Great job to all my friends in the video!! Awesome work.
So cute!  Love it.
I have said "Is there any food left from that board meeting?" about 100 times. Fave.
at my school they are band
Dad: It helps you with your concentration.     Kids: AHHHHHHHH! OHH MAIIII GOOOOOOOOOD!!!! AHHHHH GIVE ME THAT NO THAT OHH MY GOD LOOK AT THAT!!!

This is so fucking beautiful way better than the ugly ass veyron
its 2017 and people still calling hypecars supercars -_-
ok ... 41:31
worst documentary compare to previous one
Let James May be the first one to do a top speed test using the new chiron
I already preorder one         Haters ganna hate 😂
over priced overrated over hyped.
An oil change and spark plugs will set you back 10k, ill stay with my Yugo.
So how they the fastest I do believe Hennessy blew them out it'll be funny if they took 10 years to build this car and then Hennessy takes a year or 2 and crushes there speed record again
I want that scale model in the wind tunnel 🤗
Looks soo nice in all black!!
Now they need to build a electric Bugatti
dodge demon is the world fastest product car
I've always loved Bugattis but the rear end of the Chiron is absolutely hideous.
Thats why i brought the Truffade nero!
Unbeatable? Hah. I can beat it with my T20.
such an overrated car, the car has to drive through the whole nation to reach its top speed, thats when the koenigsegg comes in
I'd rather have a dodge demon, sorry guys
Urgh, but Shitsseney Venom is fasterrrrrr!!!!1111
Some TVR thrown in there?Me Thinks🤔..
I wonder how much it actually cost VW to build one.
First line, "It is a work of art." Myself being much more into things like a boosted 2jz swapped BRZ or R34 rather than a supercar, I can agree with this line despite my difference in opinion.
bugattis are ugly, and unmodern, ive ridden in one, the seats were not as comfortable as an audi r8, the speakers were shit, no gps, no seat heating, and the intereor was ugly
looks nice, but lets be honest, who's sane enough to go over 300 kph on a public road?
41:30 Holy fuck.
so many power but you will never enjoy not even 50% of the power.
WTF 0:59 that shit was fast
And the worst thing is it doesn't have xenons
sounds like gaskings
VW is a bitch for not letting koinegsegg use their long straight away. They know agera R has a faster top speed. They dont want to be dethroned. lol
I've got it in Gta😊🔥
I think K. one and regera are still faster though, unless they do a race/speed test to prove otherwise.
I work 12hr shifts, can just about make the rent and food plus other bills.  If I save my pennies I might be able to afford the theory test 😂
just imagine going 400 on the highway in America 🤔
god is so amazing
The p100d is faster 0-60 and costs a fraction of the money and seats 5+ and uses no gas and can drive itself. Gas cars are coming to an end.
Massive respect for the car and the people who make it
Forged by God thats how its made
"To prove the engine's mettle, they run it at full throttle for 25 hours straight."
And then there is coming a 2000hp Supra hehehe
Presenting how the worlds fastest Volkswagen Beetle is made
Make an electric version of that
Man that car Is a realny god of all race cars
Girl comes up to me and says...what you driving...I says...BUGATTI
- "Three thousand horsepower is enough energy to run a average house for over two month" I thought this was an engineering documentary
i'll take 2
41:38 not che chiron -.-
Impressive from a technological standpoint, but not profitable and f*cking ugly.
no gtr mentions ?
One word only one word WOW❤️
My scateboard is faster
LUL don't really give a shit about this piece of over price garbage,  can't even call a picecs of technoloies.
Why did they talk with a german accent? lol
I will take 5, thanks
the exact same car that is in gta 5 online
That engine looks like its off bloody enterprise or the voyager or something
The real question is can it corner ?
Top Gear did it better
Still cheaper than a house in Singapore
What an impressive and Gorgeous work of art, that also happens to haul ass.
the most mega car in the world 👍👍
Such a shame they won't allow anyone to use their high speed testing facility
but what's the point? Theres no place in the world thats practical, let alone legal to go 400+ KPH
koenigsegg is faster, cheeper, and better made .
Why did they make it seem 1500hp is really hard to do like going to space?😂 tons of daily driven cars with 1500+hp nowadays...
koinezegg will destroy this car.
This would still lose to Dominic Toretto's muscle car.
So uh....what do you guys think the price tag on the scaled down model would be? That'd make a sick R/C car :D
is a crazy looking machine
Still a fan of the Veyron to be honest.
Is that engine capable of make more than 1500 hp?
what so special about it i got this same car in gta
I'm buying one. I like to see the cops catch me this year
Santa.....................
Knock knock  Whos there  Cheif  Cheif who  Im inlove with the chief of you ahahahah lolz
Wow that is a nice car and fast car
I clicked on this video only because of the Top Gear thumbnail.
They run the engine at full speed for 25 hours. Holy shit that is inconceivable.
This is going to be such a brilliant car for kids to drive in Forza
The Real Question Is      VTEC ???
I too have a monocock design ;)
Looks at views
Hennessey venom is cooler.
that's a nice truffade nero you got there
Faster for what no one will ever use it's full power unless on a track and everything about it sounds extremely pricey & the car looks no different then the other Bugatti

yh have done these kind of stuff before it is such a scam
Fake dont try it you wont get anything. If it was real there wont be the need to verify and or download any extra apps.
the reason why barbra kept bitting is like when a baby is teething
link you make me nervous like children do when they hold dogs
Saagar is DADDY ASF
I was babysitting these kids once and they had removed all the teeth from their dog because it had biting problems.
I think dogs get stressed when they meet their siblings after a while.
I'm nervous that Saagar is trying to replace Rhett. Or maybe Link even...
They're growling at each other because you keep shoving them in each other's faces!!!
My dog used to be a biter too. I would go outside with him and he would actually attack me. It was terrifying but now he doesn't bite at all.
"Why are you rubbing it so hard?" XD
Barbra wants to go closer to jpeg and jpeg is scared of barbra
removed teeth?...yeah.. I fell for it for like 5 seconds
some here : #gofreego
"Why are you running it so hard?" "Cause it likes it"
What sort of *MONSTER* would return a puppy to the shelter?
"Every time you hold an animal on the show, all the comments are about how bad you are at holding animals" true
*"Just the tip."* - Saagar, 2017
Link was making me feel all kinds of uncomfortable watching him hold and pet JPEG. Link - try rubbing your arm in the same way that you were rubbing the dog. It's really painful!
Pls pls oh pls do a gummy vs real food challenge
I'm cringing at Link scruffing JPeg. He's over stimulating him (the whimpering and attempts to go back to the own is a clear sign). They should have just had the owner out from the start...
my dog is black and white. No pocket tee for me... 😥😥😥
To Be honest with you people who gag like really disturbing people should be disqualified.Who likes to see gagging?Jk.JK.Still Link up your game.Anyway link shouldn't own a pet.Rhett IS RIGHT.Link is bad at holding dogs
rhet totally molested his employees dog. I smell a lawsuit coming.
Link is such a kid when he's around animals😄
Rhett: Why are you rubbing him like that? Link: Because he likes it! JPEG: *frantically tried to escape*
Link should not hold knives or dogs.  What's with all that excessive rubbing???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????///
He's crying because he wants DOWN TO PLAY WITH HIS SISTER!  *sigh*
What kind of dogs are they?
lol put the dogs down so they can play dammit - lol
Rhett: why u scratching so hard  Link:BECAUSE IT LIKES IT  ME: literally choking from laughing too hard
Get it asphalt , it was Jpeg's a**'s faultI'm sorry to any and all children who read and understood that
I used to have a Maltepoo 3yrs ago and we had to give her away so maybe she is the mom . Her name was Coco Channel
Rhett is just as bad with pets.  It's just that every-one just ignores everything that Rhett does wrong.
I rub my dog like link, so do all the people i know to their dogs, and i can tell you they LOVE it
Is it just me or does anyone else think that its kind of funny that two bearded men have cute little doggs. lol
My mom and I both have multipoos (from different doggie families) and they are seriously both the sweetest dogs I have ever met. Must be a multipoo trait. It's crazy how much JPEG looks like my sweet Daisy.
Saagar seems like such a cool guy, I hope he's a part of the crew for a long time : )
demonetized for dog molestation
This video made my dog growl up a storm. XD
Barbara's yellow bow and JPEG's bow tie.. 💖💕 They dressed up for the show!👏🏼🐶
Still want that mug lol hope you get more
Rhett yelling at Link for petting the dog too hard lol
They are such dads. They are the sweetest young dads. I love them.
Link was rubbing the dog like that but dogs like it. If you let them soft it's just like brushing their hair. If you rub them hard it's like a massage and they love it. At least my dogs do
Why are u rubbing it so hard but I get it link I love my babies so much I want to squeeze them hahah
LOL, when both dogs were on Link
4:33 Totally a accident by his expression on his face -_- He meant to touch that...
i have 2 dogs..... one is black and one is white. what shirt do i get now?
Why are you letting link hold TWO dogs
My dog heard jpegs crying and burst into my room with a determined look on his face. He's searching the house now...
Why do I feel like the cut the video off because Link dropped both the dogs and they didn't want people yelling at him in the comments?
LOVE THE STUBBLE LINK
where/how can i watch/listen tl Ear Biscuit's
Link's "Daredevil scruff" works👍
I laughed so hard
meanwhile jade's watching this video calmly lol
BUY THE SAME COLOR TEE AS YOUR CAT. THERE ARE SOME CAT PEOPLE OUT HERE. CATS PROBABLY SHED MORE
Yeah... Link is very aggressive with animals haha
barba looks like my grandma's dog jakie
rhett mcloughlin... Sean mcloughlin
These two have become suck freaks since they became dog people.
But... Link is better at holding Rhett's and Saagar's dogs than Rhett and Saagar are.
Link call a dog whisperer to help you know how to hold a dog and Rhett I have dog that acts the same as Barbara.
I'm a nerd as soon as they where questioning the type of dog they are I picked up my dog books and got to work
Watching this instead of studying👍
Low-key in love with Saagar :)
Saagar is sooooooo cute
I vote for another video with these dogs but plus links dog and they're competing to see which is the better dog
Isn't that cute, Link thinks that those dogs wouldn't mate just because they're from the same litter.  Animals don't know, or care about, incest.
I think this is the funniest crewmember :)
I was laughing soo hard at Rhett
These are my two dogs....... JPEG and MLG. XD
6:45 So they adopted the dogs out too young? :/
4:32- Slight of hand Rhett......
My dog was fast asleep and then heard Jpeg cry and it woke her up. Now she wants to leave the room. Lol
I have a multi-poo to
Would holding their collars help with the fidgeting?
why didn't they let the dogs play with each other?  you could easily tell that they wanted to play together.  Barbara and  JPEG need some play dates with each other!!
3:16  Why is no one talking about this? lol
Link  gonna scratch the dog till it bleeds. its scaring me...
Link is such a dad. lol.
04:34 this is so bad out of context
Let's Get Him Canelo.

I'm getting a fidget spinner for my birthday on 16 may
I JUST GOT A FIDGET SPINNER IN THE MAIL
That is so popular in school!
Puppy training recommendation : Penny places should only be for penny that way she can differentiate her place and your place
Ellie I love your shirt where did you get it
Those spinners can get very out of hand
Cool my own brother made one
I hate this channel and your family
can I have one please
You know just a regular reunion in the parking lot where we are block the cars from getting parked.
My Friend got me One She gave me a golden one 🤣
I wonder if you guys had dining room chairs instead of the benches if Penny would still jump up on the table. Just a thought. 🤔
OMFG, THEY WERE PLAYING THE STORY OF TONIGHT (REPRISED) FROM HAMILTON IN THE CAR, YASSSS, YOU ARE NOW MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER
they banned fidget spinners at my school because someone got injured😂😂

Did anybody else hear Hamilton playing in the car at the beginning lol

I watch you guys when you had 1000 subs
At around 6:33 when Jackson said "go down the slide with me" I thought he said " I need you to say you love me" before Ellie repeated it 😂 that would have been so cute ❤

wb Bonnie and family
Someone had waaaaaaay too much coffee.
My kind of girl! :D
Say good bye to the imac and say hi to the surface studio!
2:01-2:02 I thought justine was going to make a other vid saying I dropped my surface
I don't know which was more exciting... The Surface Studio, or those pants you were wearing!!!
I love this channel but hate to see things get thrown, even if its just packaging or cables. I know lots of us would treasure this sort of thing instead of being really heavy handed
whats the title of the outro song? :( xx
hdds? seriously? getcha wallets ready to upgrade! as if 3.5K wasn't enough *sigh*
It has an SD card slot Omg!
That is so cool!!!
It seems not working I mean...
What I would like to see is a multi touch/capacitive screen panel like this, capable of palm rejection, plugged in a gaming PC then see how it goes.   What do you guys think?
Justine is going to cable management hell for sure.
The ultimate girl
LOVE the studio, just wish it had a bit better specs for the price...they said low specs were kinda due to the length of time they had it in development, so I'm hopeful the next iteration has hardware more worthwhile.
She is so pretty
Life Is The BomB
"STYLUS! wheres my stylus? here it eyas!" HAHAHAHA IM DYING

That thing is gorgeous and so is your house I know you've probably done this before but would you give us a tour I'd like to see the house it's super neutral toned
This is how she mastrubates 5:05
Hey do a drop test from 100 ft and say oops
seems like she's really enjoying it hahaha
Wait her bedtime is before 10:09? How does one simply go to bed that early?
that montage felt very sexual. especially when you were touching the mouse pad HAHAHAHAAAHAHAHA
woah the way she uses a mouse and she got on the table.
Is she artistic? Why she getting this if she's not a professional artist? Is it just for the sake of the video and then she'll never use it again?
the owl just stared into the distance...
I am really fond of the product, but it's too pricy.
I personally hate Windows but this is a super product!
what is the song at 3:17
Everytime justine unboxes somthing i have anxiety that she will drop it or break it
Question, would there be a way to get final cut pro onto here?
Me and my smudge body 😂 omg Justine stop! You are too funny! It's so beautiful BTW!
10:09 is late? Damn how early she have to wake up?
datttt lapshade doe! may the 4th be with you!
Surface laptop came out while your making this videos😂😂😂
5:24 LOL!!!
How Does she buys all that iPhones, computers, etc??😂 and where does she keeps them?
uhh, I've been dying to have THIS!!😔
This is squishy  Squishy can't swim Don't let squishy sink to the bottom of the comments
Why are youtubers obsessed with knives
How many thousands will this cost?
I always plug the electrical cable into the wall outlet first, then the device. But that's just me...
I saw the title of this video and about burst, so excited!!! I would love to see a review of how it's working a month or two down the road. If its worth it kind of thing? or just the hype. lol
I'm left handed to
Can I get 12 likes for my 12 b day please ?!?!
These vids show she is rich
I do not trust this girl with a knife.
Where's my knife?
Look at mi face Justine!!!,
My life is great thanks for asking
The way that knife is being handled is very, very scary
I propose you a pact: if you send me electronic products that are useless to you, I send you home-made pizza. I'm italian. Just enjoy this pact and we'll be fine together.
it looks cool
3:04 All my smudge-body girls to the dance floor!!!!!
GLAD I KNOW WHAT THAT "WHERES MY STYLUS" REFERS TO 😂😂
I'd love to lick justines fingers
What a pretty girl 😁
One up to face centrifugal forces on the table
I have the surface book and I love it. I definitely want the studio!

*I just found something free here:  **#freegooglegiftcard2017in3minutes*
thank u for the news
As long as there's social services and thugs. Vicious circle in the families continue.
Everyone wants me to JOIN. enough is enough.
koreans are the one of most racist people in the world.
Criminals prefer unarmed victims. Self defense saves lives every day. Self defense is a most important human right.
Didn't that cube guy make a rap video about getting Koreans?
A black mother shouldn't have to be afraid when her children go out to loot, rob and vandalize
Why are you bringing this up now NBC, what are you planning?
Koreans must have been so sick and tired of being pushed around by thugs.
so petty much they attacked them because they knew how to make money and live good life
"They don't have any respect for the black community." **black community loots and destroys everything they own**
Black people, I hope you realize why Koreans don't like you. This is why. It's not your skin color but your own actions. It will take time to heal, even until now Koreans will still follow you in their stores.
Lesson learned. It will happen again.
Well when you open a business near large populations of violent fatherless thugs......
black suppose to reflect themself.
Black People: Stay at home and study instead of hurting people on the streets - and then maybe you wouldn't need affirmative action for everything.
Screw these black people. I know this happened back then but what kind of crap was to to be solved if you went out and looted, killed and destroyed your community. you blacks seem to have the wrong approach to a society
lol were mad about the rodney king verdict so we'll target koreans
First comment.
hey thats pretty good
loser can't hold down a job so he has to make youtube videos cutting down other people, cuz he's perfect you know!
I want ur children
lol @ the foot
i just fell even more in love with you! #letsgorangers 💙⚪️❤️
Looks like this foot it died before Jesus.
"this foot looks like it died before Jesus" I'M IN TEARS
That foot could have belonged to a homeless man. Js
LMAO. I've seen some terrible feet in my life but that has to be the worst. WTF
Are you not familiar with the word 'scratching'?
Do another mad libs
Are you GAY?????!!!!!
Damnit I just want to be friends with Joe and Keith is that too much to ask for???
I would fucking troll those old people demanding my free kitchen. HAHA
Nice shirt Joe!!!
Why is it only 5 Mins? :3
the most athletic foot I've ever seen
You mean "scratching" Joe, not "itching". Your hilarious, but this mistake drives me crazy. ASIDE: that foot is the most revolting thing ever!!!!
that fire in aisle 7 happened in a Surrey, B.C., Canada store and is a case of arson....whoever took the picture is the one who set it.....
the foot is just too much to handle lol
Hands down favourite person to watch on Youtube! I wish your videos were longer though! :)
I was eating cereal when the creepy foot was there
I love how joe is wearing a New York rangers shirt and as I watch this I'm wearing the Montreal Canadians shirt
Omg at 0:03 he looks like Donald Trump 😂😂😂
"COCK WASH" HAHAHAAHAH
He's wearing a ny rangers jersey they suck lets go senators
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
In Australia, we don't have walmart      Come to Australia
You've never been to Walmart?
I love Joe's channel because it displays human stupidity in it's prime.
I saw that top and nope I'm out
lol Your vids always make me laugh. 💯
Was drinking water and the foot jokes started and you damn near killed me
I think it's time to get a new series
love your chanel man but GO SENS GO. Rangers are done in 6
Longer videos PLEASE! ! For the love of Walmart and idiots and taco bell's diarrhea special. ....MORE VIDEOS, and more than 5 minutes!! (And nope, 17 seconds doesn't count. ) Hilarious! !!
another spin on blow jobs lol
Fuck the rags
Cowboy bebop
How he never went to walmart?🤔
So no one made the connection between the detergent guy and the cock dryer? clearly he's the one drying his cock in the hand dryer
It died.. before Jesus 😂
I went to walmart two days ago and the cashier's name was Yard.
That is the most athletic foot I've ever seen
what if the athletes foot guy actually died while taking a poop, and nobody has checked on in in weeks..
note to self dont eat while watching joe xD
I only clicked because of the shirt
its BIG FOOTs foot lol
Lol blow job!!
I think the funniest part of this whole thing was that I left walmart  just before this was posted
annoying fuck. not funny
eh ya buddy. when ya going to get rid of the 12 year old hair cut?
you look like fucking jack jack from the incredibles
Am I the only one gets annoyed of Joe wearing a Rangers shirt?
2 million boyy
i wish i could get on the people of walmart
Joe I love you but I don't like the hockey team
3:40 looking like john cena lmao
devils>rangers still in luv w you tho
Can you please do a video of you actually going to a Walmart and documenting what you see? Love these videos and I think you need to experience it for yourself!
I like pie with cheese and olive oil mixed together
I hold in my farts and save them for the aisles of Wal-Mart.
At 3:45 min doesn't it look like John Cena 😂
get rid of the host
Who calls laundry sauce "detergent, "?
I laughed so hard about the foot that i had to go throw up
how do you the person with wrist deep in their ass is a guy? totally could be an ugly lady
The foot looks decomposed. But kudos to the confidence this person had to wear sandals. Sheesh
Wait why have u never been inside a Walmart ??????
rangers? lucky you're funny
What do you mean you've never been inside a Walmart??!?!!
"It looks like a sloth, giving itself a handshake". Holy shit that is funny. 😂👊🏼
Senators in 5!
the foot..... i just vomited.
I think i shit myself because he is so funny
why was that guy wearing flip flops
GO SENS GO!!!!
Why is Amy Schumer polluting this?
Wow. She's wide.
amy schumer is all about self pity just because she is a woman.  get over your self you cow, you're not funny anymore.
Wow, didn't realize how fat Amy Shcumer was until I saw her sitting next to slim people.
I dislike Amy Schumer's humor but she is so dang trashy-hot
While watching this video I thought to myself how much I hate/dislike Amy, scrolled through the comments and realized that I'm not the only one haha
I wish Amy Schumer was funny, then we could rest easy at night knowing that she'd never breed
hello, i literally know nothing about amy schumer, didnt even know what she looked like, can someone explain why everyone hates her to me?
How can they fit a whale on the set?
Amy is a piggy
I just realized Orlando Bloom had an accent 😢
https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/37oeoi/amy_schumer_admits_to_raping_a_guy_feminists/  Amy Schumer everyone.
who's that fat whale on the left?  jesus christ
When Amy started talking I just stopped the video...I don't wanna here a word outta her mouth.
Hey, i came here for John; get that Schumer outta here!
Amy is trash
Took me ages to realise it wasn't Bear Grylls
Ugh Amy Schumer is horrible
amy seems like she stinks
0:04 funnier than anything amy schumer has ever said
either everyone on this couch is tiny or Amy Shumer is super fat
Wow Amy is sooo fantastic  Goooo girl do your thang
yo how you get a whale to fit on stage?
i know those two mates....but who are the dumb blonde bimbos who keep interupting?
if he blocked her on his phone,  it sounds like he was the one who dumped her
Don't worry John, there's always Daisy 😉
star wars should have broke up with him. awful character, awful film.
Amy schumer is so unfunny why are they laughing shes sooo not funny I cant get over it
Goldie looks like a wax work thats melting  .. The Death Becomes Her injections did not work i guess ? .
He should've EXPLICITLY said that he starred in the new Star Wars movies
You can tell Amy Schumer is intimidated by Orlando Bloom. He's too beautiful...
1:59 especially not when it's your comedy
Can't believe there's a 15-year age difference between Orlando and John. It doesn't look it AT ALL. Bloom looks quite young for his age. :)
Cast Orlando Bloom for Star Wars!
2:20 Orlando Blooms reaction lol he's like, "weeeelll she's not wrong"
Amy is not funny. At all...
Does someone even consider Amy funny?
Ew when Amy started talking, I skipped her part. Otherwise, it would have been a lovely couch of people.
Amy Schumur could learn a thing or two about comedy from John 😂
Why does everyone hate her
I wonder why no one wants Amy...
Wow men really have an issue with amy schumer. Just shows how much hatred a white female can inspire in men.
Why is everyone making fun of Amy Schumer? Even if you don't like her, you don't have to say mean things about her. You people are extremely rude for no reason.
Bloom and Rupert Friend (Peter Quinn from Homeland) could be brothers! (See http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1670029/.)
lmao amy looks huge compared to everyone else. What a beached whale
When I saw Amy schumer I clicked away
who's that whale on the couch?
Why is that untalented fat pig on the show?
going by the comments it's nice to see the Amy schumer hate has also reached Europe.
Kinda ruined by that stupid whale Schumer
The problem Amy is that you aren't funny. Guys love funny girls...who are actually funny.
Im not gay but if i had to hit someone in the couch it woudnt be any of the female
Eh, Amy Schumer wasn't that bad in this clip.
Why is there a massive piggy on that couch?
Wow she looks like a plastic bag lol just let yourself age geez
We do like funny girls. Just not girls who steal jokes....
LOL i love Grahams expressions to things.
hahahahahaha amy schumer is soo funny...    not.
"I like funny girls" .... and that is why she is single.
Kinda wanna know the rest of the story from John
Who actually finds Amy Schumer funny?
John Boyega is so cute and cuddly, he's like a mini teddy bear.
Please help and or share if you can thanks https://www.gofundme.com/Kingsleey
You know Orlando Bloom is a great actor when he can make it look like he likes amy
I thought that was Poe lol damnit orlando
Amy Schumer has the comedy style of a 15 year-old boy.
Woah hey, what's that whale doing in the black dress with spaghetti straps?
Who's the chubby girl
Honestly guys i dont know what the problem with amy schumer is, her jokes were spot on, i was seriously laughing out loud!       Said no one ever!
Dang so much hate for Amy on this. like I get you don't like her but come on guys, keep your negative comments to yourself
People like a funny girl, people don't like a girl that thinks she's funny, but isn't
anything about Amy Schumer is  irrelevant just let me motorboat them titties
Yeah but she's not funny
If only she was funny.
Amy is so vulgar, that's why no man takes her seriously. Period.
I live in the same building in NYC as Goldie Hawn. She is a very friendly lady, knows all the building staff by name and is just a hilarious and cool woman. Glad to see her on TV and in the movies again.
He got dumped because she knew he sucks in star wars all he does is over act
Should've ended the video at 1:50
There's a few thing the internet agrees upon, and the fact that not liking Amy is one of them, perfect
Amy Schumer is the worst.
The whale ruined it
Hes black, meaning he should die
why is Amy schumer there
Wow Amy schumer told a funny joke...
Look at how huge Amy Schuarmer is. Lol she should play the new Jabba the hutt. And "guys don't like funny girls." Nah, guys just don't like you because your comedy career is about as funny as a goat burping. 
His date was probably from the dark side
2:00 Maybe that's true if you're an unfunny land-whale.
Coarse, vulgar women haven't proved anything positive. They've just thrown away the incredible asset of feminine grace, is all.  Poor Amy, she's become lost.
LMAO 😂 as "unfunny" and a horrible comedian as Amy is what did she ever do to you guys?? These comments are killing me 😂 😂 😂
What happened  to Amy S I hardly recognise all of her.
I'm uncomfortable
pussyclaaaaaat @masicka mi tel u fi kill aidona an yuh create a massacre the amount a body count dem hav a morgue......
I Love this song it bad
Thumbs up if you think Ellie and Eddiot needs to be a thing!!!
12:16 Jump scare warning!
I love the new hair Charlie. 💙💙💙
DAN PHIL AND TOM ON THE SAME STAGE MY DREAMS ARE COMING TRUE SOMEONE PLEASE FILM THIS BECAUSE I CAN'T GO
loom bands?! that craze died out like 3 years ago
'lazy unfunny fat man does things'
I love the big "HES NOT MARRIED" disclaimer
23:34 Eddie looks like Tom Hardy's Mad Max and now I can't unsee it.
That fanfic seems pretty genuine.
12:54 me when welcome to the black parade come on bc i'm emo af
Dreams of your teeth falling out means that you are afraid of abandonment
it's ugly but we are trying to save it, but it's ugly. YEAH that's what she is doing with you, you bling sheep!!! I'm kidding, dont kill me; i'm too old to die.
Can some one make the part Elliot screaming into a ringtone? Need it for science......stuffs....
...I believe that now .. all of us Weeklings should send him safe cresps in his p.o box      You've doomed yourself Tom
Tomska, what do you ilm your vlogs with?
What happened to susan
ACTUALLY THE FUTURAMA THEME WAS "INSPIRED" BY PIERRE HENRY'S "PSYCHE ROCK" 13:04
Am I the only one who thought the Triumph at 29:25 sounded really nice? I replayed that segment a couple times, lol
Tom made an accidental Pokepun at 11:22 (Dewott) :)
if your girls down for a bisexual chick I'd doo hurrr
12:18 Parts of that one actually made me laugh.
there was another pokemon pun for 'dewott' in there that they didn't do and i am personally offended.
@3:30 Thanks for the clarification~~  If we can't kiss can we at least hold hands??
Just in case you didn't know, Less Than Jake have a new EP out my dood!
tom pls come to NYC i want to meet you pls
That's ( 32:44 ) a Pixel XL isn't it? HOW does Charlie Have a Pixel XL?! They're constantly sold out!
My drawing was part of the ones Charley was sending off, it's amazing
I will see you las.... at comicon!
Backwards hat Tom looks vewy noice
that dukat is made is made of   gold you are a rice man
9:16 Charlie! You haent told us you've been time traveling!
Oh my god Tom, the cat is behind you!
Charlie's hair looks awesome that greeny blue colour (also facial expressions on point)
Pleaseeeee save the bloopers from the skits after the skit is over! Don't play it with the skitttt
Yo, I know Tom sometimes has a bad time reading the comments, but damn, the comments here Are REALLY positive this time!
Charley looks So done with your Crap tom.
S E X Y C H I L D R E N
gotta love that Canon g7x focus seeking.
Banjo-Tooie was the shit, my god, Charlie, you legend.
elliot is my editing hero
...Is that a pip-boy i see at 32:18 !?
I loved that fan sketch and how you edited it XD
I'm genuinely getting scared that my letter didn't send (or maybe it was too depressing...)
BANJO KAZOOIE IS BETTER
10:58 could have been "Stop Dewott"
These sketches are the best LOL
When he said "do what" he should have said dewott
thanks tom for mentioning me. time to rip my bucket list now.
23:35 at least he's not having "McCoy's beef" ones with new packaging design
Potential meet up in May. Hmmm.  Tomska vs A Levels.  sorry Tom.
Is Charlie ok? It's not our business and obviously she isn't obligated to be smiling 24/7, but she just seems a lot less bubbly and happy in recent videos...
Yay muffin song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As long as it has the muffin man as a dank cameo, I'll be happier. You should have gone for a carvery...just saying.
I lost my shit on that sketch.
Can you please stop vlogging your girlfriend tom? she really looks like she doesn't like it at all
Those pokemon jokes were pretty farfetched
are you still dieting tom?
Is Charlie a girl or boy? ( no offence I'm just curious )
Omg I was in tears from that sketch it was so fuckin funny
Who remembers when the title was 'Last Week I Too Tired To Function'
Looks like someone missed a 5th Generation Pokemon based pun in this weeks sketch...
SUSAN COME BACK~
ok i 100% retract my statement! you two are cute! :)
Tom, do you have a weekly framing budget?
Oh tom I'm 12 and you're the only one to stop me being scuicidal
if you want i can recommend you a few ska bands i enjoy very much. 'The Skints' 'Capdown' 'The Faintest Ideas'
Ugly cat ugly cat, does what ever an ugly does, run away, eat that food, it's just an ugly cat!!!
TOM ARE YOU GOING TO VIDCON AUSTRALIA
I love how the sketches are all written by different people yet are starting to establish continuous themes and in-jokes. Such a great community project.
The Aunty Donna delivery in the sketch is on point
opening the bag upside down maybe better compared to opening it right side up, since most of the power is there and you get to stay with the smaller bits and work your way up through the bigger ones
haha that Efteling Dukaat comes form a donkeys ass =D
Is Elliot all right?
an efteling dukaat is a coin that gets pooped out by a donkey in the efteling theme park :)
Tom you need a little bag for your artwork man :)
I can't believe Matt is married but Tom's not :D
Seriously, RSPCA??!!!! SERIOUSLY?!
TAKE A SHOT FROM THE WATER PISTOLS
I just noticed that the Last Weeks are no longer numbered... what anarchy is this?! This is almost as bad as Eddie opening crisps upside down... some people just want to watch the world burn...
if you go 19 seconds into the mine turtle video you can clearly see that tom invented dabing.
That sketch was the best one yet
Who is this guy, and why is he me?
Somebody give us a picture of Tom with a top lip

Guys go to Laurie Brooks's channel pls help
you bad person
he is a baby
I've liked the vid and my fav part is removing pretty much all the interior
A tune should have been the next upgrade
The shoe test
When's he gonna ditch the glass ?
my favorite part is back box warrrf  and the victory dance
amazing sound
My favorite part of this episode probably was when Alex just didn't give a f*ck and threw his shoe at the car, this got me good and i didn't expect that :D
Drop a MK1 MX5 engine in it.... 1.6 for less weight ofcourse.
add a badass turbo and your is 200 is faster by 20% . done
LOL My RS200 would absolutely MURDER anything you build... %1000 guaranteed.
Fart can...just like Civic...
pull the engine it will make the car very light.
I liked the stainless exhaust very much!!!!   I also noticed that you have quite big arms =D  And please tell us what was the second off / £ value of this project =)
Next:carbon hood/trunk/roof and lighter windows:) Wait,wait...spend 3K to beat stock GT86,this is prove how good GT86 is.....
My favourite bit was when it was uploaded
Turbo the is200
The fucking shoe test, I don't know why but I lost my shit right there
Oh Glory   https://youtu.be/ufFLcXRMKpA?t=4m20s
Sounds like half an XR6 with a sports exhaust.
I bought my 1996 toyota celica gt4 st205 for £2300. That's why I can't justify spending more than that on 2 second enhancements :(
My favourite part is 4:23
You have to make this into a SuperTourer, it's basically halfway there. :D
Best Part? Well, i guess the lowered suspension expression haha.
I think the best part is where they unwrapped the new exhaust.
sounds like every car on need for speed underground 2
Should do brake lines too
Good project 
The car sounds amazing! great work!
my favorite part wws "jjst the tip"
how does a better exhaust enhance performance ?
Dat dirty car
Weight reduction brah
TURBO PLZZZ
i just love the sound of is 200
My favorite part is everything.
Is Theo jealous?
By the look of that launch...that may be clutch slip.
Like...already subscribed...the dance is the best part....and you can keep the cut up manifold, thank you sir.
I unsubscribed and my favorite part of the video was the .03 seconds you werent talking
You're such a muppet
ENGINE SWAP.
throw those manifolds away nobody wants them
those sliced manifold bits would make awesome coathangers!
my favorite part was the part where he told me to favorite part
proper service the car is enough to beat gt86
Remove Driver's seat too. And Driver. And body. Just have a drivetrain and duct tape the throttle open.
No catalytic converter is why it sounds good probably
Lexus sounds nice
My favorite part was the bit where you asked people what their favorite part was.
is it too low or do the wheels just not suit the car? great sound coming from it!
4:20 why would i wanna win your trash? 😂 Funny Video though
Noddy ebc pads next? Doh. Get something proper, like some performance friction
Oh come on you didnt have to tear the car down :P it could still be a great road car
victory dance
Australian accent on point
Amazing how much that improved the exhaust sound.  I took the mufflers off my E63 AMG recently and it sounds insane,
That Lexus sounds better than every other IS200 I've ever heard driven by the fuckboys in my area that think they're hot shit. Just goes to show that they're cheap cunts.
how anyone can prefer a V6 over a Straight 6 is beyond me....SUCH a nice sound!
Still looks like it has a lot of body roll for sports suspension.
always love an unboxing but it has nothing on that victory dance
jack stands on the hoist. seems a bit fucked. never used a hoist like that before
The best part of the vid is that you proved that you can build an amazing track car for a very reasonable price and you beat an 86 with basically 3000 dollars good job guys
awesome next episode a day before my birthday there goes my sleep for that night hehe
it's a track car why leave the cat in it ? ..
It need a 2JZ...
Favorite part of the vid the victory dance without a doubt
dude that some of th ebst sound ive heard from a car like that :D
my favorite part of the video was when u threw the shoe at the car XD
Best part was when the lift was too high and he was on his tiptoes
they might need to stiffen up the coilovers a bit, it seemed that car was body rolling a bit too much for a track car. and another good weight reduction is removing the front and rear bumper energy absorbers.
sounds so good
I loved your face when the coilovers came out of the box lol
Favourite part of the video? This is my favourite series on youtube right now! No joke.
taking out the exhaust manifold was my favorite part
Hmmm... 150 hp? No thank you.
I like the part of the video where you send me one of those header bits. Thanks.
eBay parts 😬
when you started dancing was so funny
You should only wear a thong as weight reduction
Shoe test was my favorite
I find the lack of fist test in this video VERY disturbing.
Love the ending bucket seat dance
The hair of course
I love the angle grinder
The engine starting with the new exhaust sound ! Best part ! Maybe with the announcement of the last lap time... :D
That thing sounds fucking insane hahahaha
Amazing and long waited series!
You should be starting with engine(turbo)
What the fuck are those creps
That startup noise @ 5:08  Now send me your scrap
I swear these came with 3sge?
Still getting a lot of roll. Try swapping the old rubber bushes with polycarbonate ones and have a look at the anti-roll bars.

Hello Ad  *says while watching ad*
wow can you make this a series
did you get ad a gun to protect you from the grizzlies
How much money do you really need, with that much ad in your video
I used to think julien was super sexy, now he looks like a dad who sits in his office all day. And Jenna you fly as fuck girl but u need your sexiness back. You should give each other sexy makeovers for your next vid
Seeing Ad eating everything reminds me of the video she did trying to get Marbles, Kermit, and Peach to eat fruits and veggies lol. New video "What WON'T Ad eat?"
This is the best oml aW
"don't cry, craft" I am screaming, do not touch me, cease your activities. not only is this a hamster video, he said "don't cry, craft" and that makes me scream
that man looks like he has an obese long-haired guinea pig sitting on his  head
Tbh Jenna made me cry by how happy it made her
I feel like Jenna and Julien are going to have a whole zoo before they actually have kids that aren't animals
I laughed so hard I 100% sure I died😂😂😊😂
Jenna's "crying/not crying" voice is my favourite
That is just        ADorable😂
I just learned how to use a protractor yesterday 😂 (btw I'm 9)

I love mother jen
My son is a hamster too
I choked on my cereal when she said 'don't cry, craft' dAN AND PHIL MY DADS
DON'T CRY CRAFT
someone needs to stop jenna before she gets out of hand
Not gonna lie, Julien looks hot with those glasses
I'm not going to tell you how to raise your son, but Ad looks thirsty.
I have to settle with ad as my virtual pet hamster. I wish they where Available im Australia 😩
this is my favorite video in the world
What type of hamster is ad?
Please have a kid alreadyyyyyy
TAKE AD TO THE PARK HE DESERVES A GOOD CHILDHOOD BEFORE HE GROWS UP
Please turn ad into either Willy wonka or Robbin hood for a Jenna's ratchet salon
This is the wholesome content that I needed
i legit want a relationship like them. were our children our are animals  XD
HE IS SO CUUUUUUITTTEEEE
everything is liquid elmer's GLUE
Ad reminds me of that hamster from that kid show with the talking hamsters. It would be so cool if Jenna did a video like that
"Don't cry, craft" BLESS YOUR SOULS
Well done. I love his new cage with a wodent wheel and lots of room! Well done! Good hammy parents. Also, those pancakes looked great!
don't cry.... craft
Loving how they used a file instead of sand paper :')
Julien is like a cat just making random noises and coughing up hairballs and knocking shit over 😂😂😂
Julian is such a troller! 😹
the colledge he is going to is hamvard lol
This reminds me of Katy Perry's new music video chained to the rhythm
THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
My cousin did that he used toxic glue...R.I.P in peace Ginger!
this is adorable. this is perfection.
3:48 i really thought we were past this okay

i have s6 edge and want to upgrade because i hate s6 due overheating I want to upgrade to s8 but afraid it's too overheating and thinking buy iphone7
Nice, I like new screen (screen-to-body ratio of 84.26%). If I could only afford it :).
I'm getting around 6 to 6 1/2 hours of SOT on my s8
That's one hell of an ugly wallpaper...
I love the plus! but that AKG cord is a right royal pain in the arse.
where can I find the wallpaper you use
Hey man, thanks for the video I actually ended up getting the s8 the day after watching this as I was trying to decide on a new phone. Glad this review had enough positivity for me to get it because it's wonderful
Perfection, hope i will win it!
Whats that wallpaper ?
Hey Josh great video as always! Loved the opening shot and the pan at 1:40. What camera do you use for these? Just gorgelus shots all around. What do use for the pan? Always fun watching your videos. Keep being awesome.
Very comprehensive and detailed review. It is useful for digging into alot of the features of the S8
Great video. a in depth review and voice is so nice to listen to
great review by android authority...infinity and amoled screen is amazing and so the review was
How is 1080p at 60 FPS an addition? It's been a thing since the S5.
Great phone with a good spec, tons of features. Its near bezel-less screen looks awesome, I really like it!!
The phone looks pretty dope.
whatever you say, the s8 plus is the best looking phone out there
Excellent review.I feel like I know the phone already by your review. Always helpful knowing an in-depth detail about phone.Tells us all we need to know about the phone.
this phone is perfect combination of Windows phone and Iphone.    I want this,.
like the nuances and how you played with the video within a video to illustrate the new aspect ratio; keep it up, a little change Is always appreciated.
watching this on my potato 🤧
Great video! I wish had the ability to do videos like this. Really helped me.
Realy great review , keep doing it like that
feels like a 'beta test' phone galaxy s8 = Nay. samsung has a better, more refined version of s8 in the making. The galaxy s9
anyone else's s8 sometimes not register when you touch the screen?
I've been watching your videos for a while now and I appreciate the in detail content that you all give about your device and app reviews. They're extremely helpful and keep up the great work!👍
Ok final decision,i'm keeping my 5s until next year and when the S9 will be released i'm gonna buy S8 cause it will be more cheaper hehe
s8 has Built in FM tuner? can we listen FM without internet?
Great review. Always helpful knowing an in-depth detail about this. Hope there are no fiasco like the Note 7.
Can u give the link to the wallpaper?pls
great review! I always enjoy how detailed every review from Android central is! one of my most trusted sources for reviews, I may just end up buying the Galaxy S8+!
2:16 Nice subliminal Logitech advertisement
great review.I like both Galaxy S8 and LG G6. They are incredible and amazing smartphones, but I think G6 is more user friendly.
I found this a very informative video on the S8 explaining the spec's and showing the phone in use. Nice job.
i don't see the appeal of the camera from these shots, people definitely tend to overhype the S8's photos on some videos but there are definitely prettier cameras out there
Nice presentation and shots of the S8. Great Review!
Hello,got my S+ from samsung but surprised that it doesnt have the S8+Logo. Hope its the real deal
Watching this on my s7 edge. It's working smoothly good as the first day. I was just curious, no need for upgrade any time soon. Though s8 seems impeccable.
Hi Joshua..keep doing the good work.Pls share videos on chinese mobiles like xiaomi,Zte  etc
Hi Joshua  I was wondering if there is any difference ordering the S8 directly from Samsung or from my carrier?  Thank you for your excellent reviews!
I want it with the spen
This is why I love this channel. Their reviews are on point with great video photography. Tells us all we need to know about the phone.
Except for the camera, S8 is really an innovative phone. And yeah, Joshua Vergara is one of the best tech reviewer. Please stay active on your jvtechtea channel too :)
hey cool job man  i like ur presentations always 😁 keep reviewing like this only 👍 our support is wid you👍
So my S6 has a burned in image of Facebook (still not sure how that happened) what are the odds of the S8 having a burn in?
Nice review android authority... Keep it up...
Ive always enjoyed watching your videos specially those from josh vergara. You guys more or less decide for me whether a phones a good buy or not. And i must say this s8 is pretty amazing! More videos to come!
I'm loving my OP3T but hot damn the s8 looks hot, excellent review as always Josh! Proud Pinoy Here!
Josh, you have always inspired me to make content of my own so that one day I could be as good as you!
I LOVE you cinematography!! The intro was VERY cool. I always look forward to your next reviews and podcast. :)
Zenyatta in the background!
HELLO!!! AND WELCOME TO WRESTLE TALK NEWS. MY NAME IS OLI DAVIS AND....( I can't possibly be the only one right???)
the music in background is disturbing to much
really loved the S8 although I didn't see it personally. thanks for the review it made me love it way more 👏👏. great review
This phone sounds like a total rip-off of the Lumnia 950 that came out 2 years ago! Samsung decks? More like Windows Continuum Iris Scanner? Where have we seen that before? The Lumia 950 and 950 XL; 2015
nice review
that's a beautiful and shiny display
great review of the new Samsung so helpful now I know what to expect when I get one.
🍈 I dont really like new s8 icons style
I'm owning Galaxy S7 Edge but wow this phone really got me. S8+ is the  Best phone of 2017.
As usual a nice review in here. I love the way you make these reviews - from photography to content. Continue with these high quality reviews. Cheers. 👍👍👍
Two words: It's Great  Depends on everyone's personal taste.
Taking a look at that display at time 2.08 is breathtaking, I have the Galaxy S7 and to think they've improved on its display by this much is incredible :)
I've always loved watching videos from this channel, it's detailed, and everything you need to know about a certain device is mentioned, I hope to see more videos 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
what song is that
Great video Joshua. I feel like I got a good grasp on what the S8 has to offer and some of the negatives such as the finger print scanner.  Thanks again and keep the videos coming!
Hey , Josh I love your Cinematography and the way you shoot your videos and audio is always nice :) The way you present and convey the review is really top notch :)
I really like ur version of the  s8 review it answered plenty of questions I asked myself, I can't wait to watch another video.
Really like the way you review stuff here!  Great work!
Reasons why I like Josh Vergara's reviews: 1. Thorough 2. Clearly and eloquently explained 3. Cool editing 4. His hands
Great production from Josh V. as always! One of my favorite reviewers.
Like the wallpapers where can i get them?
Nice review on the samsung galaxy s8 :). This is really helpful for me to choose between the galaxy s8 or other smartphones good job 👏🏼
Holy Moly 😃 am I the only person who think that...he has the perfect voice for this kind of reviewing?? 👏👏👏 thank you....waiting for your upcoming posts 😊😊😊😊😊
Your Introduction on the s8 itself was hands down awesome,loved it!!
Great S8 review Android Authority! Really like the way you explain how the new software and features work. Keep up good work!
The Creativity of displaying some parts of your video on that massive Display was remarkable!
The phone is awesome and cool. design is good. and loved this video and the way you represent it is awesome.
Joshua, I love the way you start your videos, man! "The Samsung Galaxy, S8." That pause nails it. Great video! Keep up the good work team @androidauthority. :)
Stunning phone, I wonder what the next "trend" will be within the tech industry... Loving your videos watch them every day along with reading your articles on your app.
Another well made honest review, As always and great editing ! :)
Great review coverage, man! I enjoyed watching it even though I can't afford one. The little 4th wallbreak at the beginning was well thought of, tho. :)
But, they dindu nuffin!
Humans in general need to get kicked in the teeth for your unbecoming behavior, regardless of culture/nationality.
looks like black lives don't matter to black lives matter
how dare he slapped her?! he should be hang like back in the days and the 2 nice ladies should be elected president of the United States
Why are two grown women fighting?
get the fuck off her! *smack* 😂
Man thought let me hit someone for fun coz i got fly this boring ass plane 0:21
And the real hero of this story goes "hey... hey... heeyyy"... Dickhead, grow yourself some balls
Hit 'er again! LOL Beasty's Baaack!!
The appropriate work behavior should of been for him to just walk by and stay out of it, He is a *PILOT NOT SECURITY thats what they hire *SECURITY for.
TMZ is the cancer of the world...  Anybody who works there deserves to be hanged from a tree...
He didn't even hit her that hard
Really? Those bitches start fighting and almost hit an old lady in a wheelchair?
delta need to get careful they don't get sued. he hit the wopman while he was in delta uniform!
This mofo better not get fired because two hoodrats wanna duke it out in the airport like a couple baboons
Please fired the mayo eating bitch!!!!!
I hope the fired the white dog smelling mayo eating pail face white devil bitch
i woulda kicked them both till they stoped
Good for the pilot. He should have smacked that ass! Good for him!!!
never give hood rat trash enough money to go to the airport, this is expected of them, typical uncivilized, probably fighting over trivial nonsense.  P L E B S
what the fudge cakes? why did that pilot hit brad?
ahahahahahahaha...departing from Atlanta? No shit. That City is known for it's large population of, umm, high IQ Japanese people...
BLACK PEOPLE
Chimping out.  EEEEWWW Crabs and nits.
If I was acting like an ASSHOLE = I would expect to get an assholes reward.   These BT-1000 b*tches are lucky it wasn't security there to taze their ass.
Possibly the most expensive slap ever.
So what happens the next time these "ladies" travel and escalate their violence?  Just sit back and record the beating. Greyhound of the skies.
i guess she didn't want to sit in the back of the plane
Well, supposedly one of them were choking the other, he wanted to stop it from escalating...He should have not intervene, in my opinion.
It was the passenger fault for being rude and starting the fight yet it seem the pilot just wanted to punch them, then later coming to break it up.
Slovingly Sloppy women raised in caves. It's just a product of bad environment and no moral upbringing.  Just a sign of the times.
GUETTO PEOPLE CANT BEHAVE ANYWHERE
could this have been a setup? what are the odds that someone is filming boarding, and then catching something like that? someone just wanted a paycheck.
We should export all these worthless gorillas and import productive aliens.
black people are savages, always making a ruckus everywhere they go. c'mon act civilized!
Why can't I just be wrong more often? Every time I hear of stuff like this (2 adult women in a fight), I immediately say to myself, "They are black." I'm almost always right. Is this racism or reality?
Black culture.
Animal ass hoodrats acting like they on Worldstar fighting over EBT cards
typical she-boons
Lol look at all these bigoted ass trailer apes just drooling at the mouth over this vid. Shouldn't you inbreds be somewhere right now fighting over mayonnaise, meth, N child porn?? Get on your job you fucking hicks
we should have picked our own cotton.
Put them in the cargo hold with the rest of the overweight bags.
He was trying to brake the fight.
The pilot dindu nuffin man.
Apes at work
Nice going Captain; these fucking black savages are always acting like sub human scum. They should carry billy clubs and smack these ignorant swine upside the head!
The airlines need to stop over booking the flight with black women. If more than 1 black women  is present, they will always start fighting.
It's what you got to do. Be the man. Take the control.
The only way to transport these people is in cages by UPS ground.
there were women fighting? I thought it was 2 bigfoots mating and a skinny freaky white dood trying to get in on the action.
Nothing wrong with slapping a she-boon, just wear gloves so it doesn't contaminate you.
OOGA BOOGA DINDU NUFFIN
Hood Rats at war!
The dumb C**t deserved it.
They both should be punished for acting like challenged monkeys 🐒
he slapped her hand so she'd let go
A. Not a punch that's using your fist to knock off a grip.
Two dumb monkeys want to slings fists like they're in cages at the zoo. So talk shit and get hit...they didn't mention by anyone. There is no racism here. Just a pilot who is tired of stupid monkeys.
I support the captain 100%. If you want to have a fight, don't do it while boarding a plane for heaven sake.
OMG....they finally made Airplane! 3 ?
LOL, knew it before I watched it.. Its the baby daddy breeders..
why are they accusing him for he was trying to break up the fight
Sean Connery would be proud.  "women" are less mature than teenage little girls, and need some discipline.  proud of this guy.
Did anyone really need to see the video to be able to know instinctively the ethnicity of these "women"?
So whos at fault? I think its the women
Is there anywhere black women wont figh like animals?
Typical African female behavior
So!? Most women deserve to be smacked just on principle.
Black lives matter?   If you want to be treated like a human act like a human and not an animal
Why did you change your mind about putting this on YouTube?
What "recovery"? I still need a better job.
I've  been working on the method for a Decentralized basic income using the blockchain
Elite told you this in Star trek .. the borg is representation of corperate america
Resistance is Futile .. you will be assimulated! the Borg how ironic the population of the planet has been assimulated and doesnt even know it
What I never understood about the 'depopulation secret agenda' is if that is the goal why not just make contraception free and fast track RISUG and then do a massive family planning/sex education media blitz?
The Swiss government has been attempting to implement a basic income but the voters voted it down a couple of years ago by a margin of 70%.
This channel keeps getting better and better!
So, basically your talking about "The United Federation of Planets" .
Thanks for making this available. Being outside the US, I can't get to the Amazon video site. How much were you charging on Amazon? I'm MORE THAN happy to make a donation of the same amount.
So Trump is not a part of this scam?
That was great Melissa and Aaron, very well put together. Keep it up!
"The future doesn't need your labor" -- Great! I want to live in that future, work is for slaves ...
Space Communism should be our main goal!
Let's be honest, most "jobs" have been made up bullshit for decades.  Universal Basic Income is going to be needed.
good one, guys!!!
it's really very simple remove the psychopaths from the equation teach the children properly and normal people find things to do to be creative and productive but not if they're letting Psychopaths show run then like
Thank you. I will watch it. Keep up the good work!
30:57 really????thats tottaly mad
If your job is so easy a robot can do, i suggest acquiring more skills. This is like saying we shouldn't have made the cotton gin because it took away the jobs of cotton pickers.
Thanks for sharing for those which could not access the Amazon Prime video - the only way to free humanity is to free information. You rock as always.
Prometeus/Alien Covenant - the Engineers! - the hint in the movie about our times.
This is amazing...and sad...and scary.
tricle up economics works better than anything
How are we going to be enslaved if we don't work?
Probably the most important documentary this decade. Speechless, well done Aaron and Melissa :) Deserves so much more exposure and credit.
hahahahaha holy fuck this is retarded alarmism. Keep it up!
Complaining if "forced" to work calling it modern slavery, complaining about robotization,  wtf,  any constructive alternatives?
Thank you. The mouse experiment should be enough for all us to stand NOW and STOP the elite!!
WHEN THERE A.I. SYSTEM IS COMPLETE ? THEN HUMANITY BECOMES ? OBSOLETE ? IT STARTED WITH THE CAR FACTORY,S ? OH ROBOTS ARE GOOD ON THE FACTORY FLOOR - JOBS LOST - MORE ROBOTS - LESS JOBS ?
And don't forget that your Federal Government will find a use for you—alive or dead
This is part of the reason why many Sociologists require psychological counseling by the end of their effort to achieve the doctorate.
Work hard to get enough money to buy a robot slave in the future = problem solved
"Who?"  Who pays to produce these types of videos?  "Why?"  Why is endless money being invested to produce these types of videos?  "What?"  What can you do to improve your existence?
who the fuck they owe money to.  you the biggest and baddest ... take it like you take everything else in the world...  y'all know you don't have to pay shit back
you guys should listen to michael tellinger
OMG the Amish were right!
thank god this isn't real.
The argument that people will lose a sense of purpose because they don't need to work is wrong. We can explore other things. Nature , scientific research, art, etc.
Wow, that was exceptional and terrifying
The mouse apocalypse was what would happen if the world's population moved to Texas.
Uber has already talked about replacing human drivers.
WHO THINKS IT IS TIME FOR PEOPLE TO STOP WORKING SO MUCH? WE WILL HAVE ALL DAY TO BE TROLLS ONLINE
scroll back up and watch the damn program....
well this documentary is just full of "facts"
Europeans heeded the call to control birthrate and now we pay the price. Swamping and invasion.
FYI it buffers bad after 42.2 mark .
"documentary." I think we are stretching the definition of this word.
Thanks for telling me that going into the field of automation will be profitable
this is the  prophecy about to be fulfilled ,chose whom will you serve men (the elite) or God ? true freedom you will get from God if you just let go of your ego
Image that a experiment run on people in California!! Sounds like what's happening now out there in the streets. Just saying!
need basic income.   give socialism a chance!  capitalism is ending.
Robots will be bringing humans to "The Antiques Roadshow" to find out what they're worth
Thanks thanks thanks! Posted on twitter!

Adele might set fire to rain... But SpongeBob can make a campfire under water.

Now for days I will be going in my head... "thunder fell the thunder..."
My least favourite imagine dragons song below levitate

#teampoland
I've heard this band was hired by valve that almost made the soundtrack for half life 3.but was sadly cancelled for business reasons or money problems.

Their trying to get popular again by making weird stuff to gain attention
My favourite so far <3
I can't stop watching it tho

Aliens,Rap shitty dance moes AND lyrics Well imagine Dragons has changed not in a good Way!!!
I am still trying to figure out which side is the front of that creature.

I like the part where he is punching air lol
I don't think it's THAT weird, I think people are just grossed out by the contortionists... good song though
I wonder how many hours of editing it took them to make this video 😂
So the sheep's in the video Represents us...
This video isn't satanic lmao y'all are dumb, its meaning it's quite clear actually.
I love Jesus Christ

srsly....the sipit was the queen egg face hugger
Your shitty slideshow sucked!
...ans it wasn't even mentioned!
those creatures really look bizarre. I would definitely freak out if I was to run across something like that.  Anyone looking to grow their channel? subscribe to me and I will subscribe to you it's just that simple.
That's an Alien facehugger.
top right under the video, left click, report, misleading done
If you use a thumb that is not in your video you get a thumbs down. I think everyone should do this to stop click bait.
Don't worry,Humanity will kill off these animals soon.Even in Antarctica..
Antartica is a desert not a tundra
Why do you use pics that are not part of your movie?
Clickbate bullshit.
wasted my time
that "20 inches" sounds dirty...
looks like a rubber fake
Run as fast as you can and don't touch it
Thumbnail nothing but a movie prop. Thanks for nothing
clickbait bullshit. I hope whoever made this gets headbutted asap. false advertising fuckface
Jesus, could she sound more dump?
I knew it was a lie. Anyone else notice how brown people are very superstitious?
Holy click-bait batman!
oh god that thing from the cover is from Alien
Still looks like a fucking spider! Death to them all. Spiders make me scream like a bitch.
Well I've heard it all now! "A hoff crab" fuck me
Nice posting the Alien off of Aliens as a nice click baiter.
do number 10 live on/in humans?
it looks like the facehugger queen holder?
@7:03 the penguins have cable ties on their wings?!
its the fucking alien ! wheres predator
attractive sexy female voice :-)
The face hugger was found from the filming of AVP.
report>spam or misleading>misleading thumbnails
clickbait. flagging. also fuck you.
CLICKBAIT MOTHERFUKER
Hoff Lobster!
Clickbait thumbnail, thumbs down
The 1st one looks like something from my vacuum cleaner xD
"the Frozen tundra of Antarctica".  lol
what a crock of bullshit!!
Ant ar ti caaaaaaaaaaaaa!  lets hear it for the san fernando valley, CA narrator.
why the f*** is a salmonella Facehugger
You were trolled by the facehugger :D
Soooo many ads...
Sad. Selfish super greedy individuals are hindering our progress and existence..  Good post.
Antartic creatures where the top2 are from the Artic- guess you have your poles wrong
I did. Looks like aliens are real?
Narrator Sucks! Are they teaching female anchors to sound like valley girls now?
just for refrence there have been many photos and vidoes of live giants squids within the last couple years..even hunting and attacking artifical jellyfish and prey .not all subjects studied or photod were dead.
it seemed like it was a science project
also the portal to the inner earth.
Obvious click bait! I didn't watch it.
Antarctica is not tundra.  You instantly fail.
when the thumbnail is not even real but an Alien prop and used for the clickbait.. dislike foh
also i clicked becouse  the facehugger.
ITS CALLED A  YETI  CRAB NOT HOFF CRAB !!!!
This video has no investigation of if they were actually found in Antarctica, but what I can say is most of what they show has been found years ago but not in the continent surrounding our plane
I saw that on an episode on the  OUTER LIMITS...  IT WRAPPED ITSELF AROUND THE VICTIMS FACE...
facehugger clickbait bullshit....wait they beat me to that burn in the video.  Curses, foiled again!
Definitely blocking this channel. But that should be expected when you post images of movie props to get clicks.
4:20 "some of you may have seen this picture floating around, but this is just a hoax." *Uses it as thumbnail for clickbait.*
Elephant seal reminds me of my sister
the tardigrade looks like a strange bag bear thing WHAT IS THIS?!?!?
Just stopping by to thumbs down.
To be frank, this narrator talks way too fast to be be clearly understood.  What's her rush?
Disappointing. Don't keep putting the fake ones up front just to get views and subs. The contents of your videos are always great and really very interesting, but please. Don't resort to click bait.
Pick a pole and stick with it. What a mess of a video... and points for the Alien clickbait.
*CLICK BAIT ! FAKE FACE HUGGER JUST TO SHOW YOU SEA ANIMALS*
FUCKING PICTURES GET ACTUAL VIDEOS YOU FUCKING UGLY CUNT OMG
Really? 4 ads in a 10 min video...greedy much?
2:44 most Innocent face :'3
FACE HUGGERS ARE REAL
funny. my daughter was watching this exact video on our tv this morning.
When you know it's click bait but you look anyway.

ANC has expired thanks to Zooma.....
Never under estimate the power of the people ,they brought you here ,they will remove you from here
Zuma has cost this country more than what I can imagine ,the only place suitable for him is JAIL ,he failed the organization and the people of S.A. at large ,let him rot in jail ,he doesn't deserve to be with community
Be carefull my friend, the Isrealites are very present in SA and they are investing a lot here. So use negotiations not sanctions because the israelites own the economy and the banking system.
So we have a militant Islamist on stage? right? He sounds like Eugene Terreblanche. And Zuma? SA has spoken, STEP DOWN.
Those Num supporters they must behavior or why they did not go and to those opposition parties at their rally they must leave our Cosatu federation
some of the people like to fool themselves because Zuma does not going anywhere and those who want to disrupted the their are wearing t-shirts return 100% support pres Zuma
If i were you baba msholozi after this moment i should go to resign

Lebron is our only hope to stop the super team and annoying GOlden state warriors
Sweep!!!! going to be to eazzzy for the Cavs
Nba 2K18 going to be lit yall
Other than the current Warriors, I think the last team to have a legit chance to beat LeBron with a HEALTHY team was the 2012 Thunder after they matured together of course. Unfortunately for them, money talks.
We The Lorth
I can't even watch this. raptors play no Defense making the Cavs look totally unstoppable. they ain't even competing.
As a Cavs fan, what got me excited was Shumpert's offensive game...man if he could provide a solid 10 points a game off the bench that'd be amazing
Game 7 is coming the raptors are a hard team to eliminate
marv albert..... "he had a foot on the line for a 2 pointer".... when the guy is 2 feet in FRONT of the line haha
If the raptors had homecourt advantage it would be 2-0 Raps already
1:56 - 1:58 Lebron was caught slippin. It's funny cuz he tried to play it off lol.
Lebron got crossed ?
I think its Boston vs Cleveland for the ECF, I have a very selfish reason why I dont want Boston to win...first I'm a Cleveland fan, second Boston is a racist ass city that doesnt deserve another championship.
raptors you fucking rookie cocksuckwrs. .... we need a fucking new team.... getting killed out there
cavs defense is getting better and better
Lebron was made in a laboratory.
Lol @ Lebron not even paying attention on the bench after the play at 8:40
Shumpert was going in
#YallStillTheNorth?
With all due respect for Toronto Raptors and I love the way they play but, Cleveland Cavaliers are just waiting for Game June 1st.
The crowd is just like "shit this is boring. Can we move on to the next team?"
shump killed it in trash time
lebron got pissed off. after that anckle bruiser.
4-0 on the Go !
Lebrun could have had 50 but they took him out for the last 5-6 minutes lol
Lebron definitely on his way to passing Jordan. 💯
Lebron is a monster, by the end of this playoffs he will be the all-time playoffs leading scorer, and he ain't even looking to score...
LeBron is clearly the GOAT.. MJ fans sorry but MJ was a ball hogging cunt. :) And people who call Curry GOAT should suck themselves! :)
As a Raptor fan, it's embarrassing to know that we were supposedly the closest team to beating Cleveland and then play like this. Smh pacers even played better then this.
kyrie deserves just as much credit as LeBron, LeBron isn't carrying the cavs by himself... cavs are a good team!
I'm still gonna cheer on the Raptors but it's clear Cleveland is the dominant team. Respect to the real fans Cavs and not those bandwagon turds. Go to the finals and show the world the West is overrated.
WHERE THEM BARNEY FANS AT? LMFAO! CRAPTORS AINT DOIN SHIT TRASH ASS TEAM!!
5:56 start circus music
Awesome video!
Clippers and Raptors are the most pathetic organization currently
I am the only one who appreciate that Channing Frye's shot release is so dope?
Im a warriors fan by law but im kinda getting worried for gs playing against them  if any team make it
CELTICS VS SPURS IN FINALS
cavaliers in championship mode..!!!
lol even the pacers did better than the raptors smh how sway
As a Raptors fan, I would like to be optimistic rather than realistic, but the Cavs are the defending champions and I don't see this confused Raptors team even winning a single game. hats off and good at the finals
is shumpert learning from kyrie?!
Looks Like Demar de FROZEN is in playoff form. And yall said this guy is better than butler and klay LOL
3:10 The crybaby when somebody actually plays some defense on him, he is very stoppable. Apparently you are not allowed to try to block him, you got to allow him a free pass to the basket like most opponents do
I thought MIL might've given the Cavs a good run for their $, but TOR has nothing to hurt them. I called sweep before the series started.
niggas said Raptors was gonna win the east LMAOOOOO @ ESPN BPI AND FIVETHIRTYEIGHT
I hope the cavs sweep them
too bad you can't throw in the towel in basketball huh
Raps man I don't know what to say...
Lemeteor james gonna bring the craptors to extinction again.... lol
the Cavs are really dangerous in the playoffs.# all hail the king
Lebron...man I hate u so much and I like u too
Die Hard Bulls Fan.....Jordan Is a God but LeChosen is just the GOAT. Dont Reply.
nothing to watch here, but a non competive series​, let me guess Cavs sweep
Gsw are shook
Like I said Toronto Laptors will get swept by 20 pt each game.
Will pass Michael Jordan in points with half as many titles, second best to put on 23
bye raptors 😂😂😂😂😂
Cavs need more help .. they are top heavy ..!
may the best team win
Go Lebron's Company......#qoCAVS.
Kyrie been watching Chris Paul tapes he has been playing more of a natural point guard role.
how did the cavs made all of those 3s?? NBA is rigged..
Toronto Barneys #WeTheChoke
Iman looking Kyrie late in the 4th lol
too much good cavz   i like the way u play this game....congrats guys.....
I say DeFrozen and Lowry go the West just liike every other star. All cause of LeBron James. Paul G. going to West too. NBA needs to balance these stars
Le........LeBeast, LeGOAT....Bron.
DeRozan choked, lowry got injured, raptor playing sucks today,, well, good bye finals.
rapid highlights is the 🐐
I'm pretty much watching cavs play this whole highlights
Marv Albert voice, "And here comes DeFrozen!"
Nothing but respect for LeBron James, Hoping to see you in the NBA finals🙌💍💍
Early in his career, LBJ  almost hated to take a "3".  Now, they're falling from all over the place.
Swept... again...
Raptors are extinct
#CavsBacktoBack #DefendTheLand #LeGoatLeKingLeJames
Ok let's act like Lebrun didn't get his ankles broke in the first half .
lol.. 8:44 leGoat cutting his nail at bench..
i swear when james is making his 3s the Cavs cannot lose
DeRozan probably one of the most overrated player, He's  actually a trash this post-season.
I'm a Raps fan but how was 3:32 not a travel on Lowry and 4:12 not a double dribble by JV??
Did it came under your car wheel ?
That was Cody garbrant running over tj dillashaw.

Poor snake. He jumped fast and died a Virgin.
The snake didn't target anything, he drove a few centimetres next to it and it tried to defend itself
Holy shit what's with the dislikes??
Hit like if you had watched this video earlier in Facebook.
The nigga later came back and ate it.
Why they are filming motorcyclist in first place?

Bluesy solo, love the electric guitar on this one.

He needs to do a tour with Sturgill Simpson and they could call it the : Mountain Man tour
Don't listen to country at all but was bobbing my head hard af to this
I don't sleep with my sister or beat my wife, why am I here?
Song of the summer right here! 🔊🔊
Comin correct as always. BOOM!
What's with youtube putting all this country on trending?
10 outta 10 Chris keep up the above the rest level
This one is a little more blues/rock than country...but damn it's a good song! It's amazing how he can do everything from bluegrass to this. This guy can do no wrong.
GOT DAMN this is a good fucking song. Got me moving like I haven't moved in a long time!!!!!
This reminds me of the times i lived in a shed house at a park

Great new song! Catchy guitar, great vocals.  Chris Stapleton and nothing to be added...  Immediately felt the need to get my guitar and play along ;)
He's doing what Garth Brooks did ...hard body guitars and rock drums no fiddles and steel guitars that's Country not  this rock shit with a cowboy hat on
I got my tickets to the concert!
Is this the second coming of great rock and roll, sure sounds like it. Keep them coming Chris, and we'll keep listening!
Real country songs!! Love Broken Halo's too. Hope we get to hear some of these in person June 10 when he comes to Alabama!!
This guy can't make a bad song.
New Favorite!
Phenominal..I think i spelled that word correct..Chris Stapleton is the man of country soul & rock and roll...
I hope that he puts "You should probably leave" on his next album, its amazing and ive only heard it live..
If you don't like Chris Stapleton, I can't be your friend.
Sweet baby Jesus! I feel like this tune is making love to my ear canal

Interesting that 25 people accidentally hit the thumbs down button when they intended to hit thumbs up, or they are idiots. That is some good tunes.

That's a pretty annoying guitar riff.
I have been waiting for this to be released since I heard it at the ACM awards. Can't wait to hear it live at Red Rocks!
Awesome song and LOVE it! And this one was published on my birthday!  Excellent gift Mr. Stapleton!

Are these things Basically Whoppers Candies
Ah yes, very tasteful humour from the corporate world.
Forced diversity
Lol. That's a good ad.
Has this been banned
Just wanted to be that one dickhead who says "I ate a bag of Maltesers while watching this." I did. They were tasty.
Ok why is she throwing her maltesers away does she not like them or something
Great. Now the disabled too can be dragged into cynical, innuendo-laced advertising for sugary snacks. Big step forward.
*“A man should look for what is and not for what he thinks should be." - Albert Einstein.* Learn the truth of life at Truthcontest ◦ com.
Maltesers should employ Ricky Berwick
Look, Maltesers will not be removed from the shelves. Don't worry, your auntie can still bring you some when you are in the mental institution again.
I don't know either whether anyone reads the comments, but I LOVE these ads! Brilliantly funny, AND (at last)inclusive. A big risk by Maltesers and the Ad agency, but DEFO paid off, imho, XXX
That girl is a real malteser
she lives i my area
I like trains.
oh my that is hot that is hot
I don't mind thud advent it'd better F than the other I ever but still feels it's over the top X
Am I the only one who thinks its stupid that youtubers can get there pay reduced for rude content because advertisers dont want that, only to have adverts like this played before their content.
Hopefully our innocent children will recreate this playful scene in playgrounds everywhere, especially all the innuendo and sexual gestures. Actually, not really. It's absolutely disgusting.
fucking hate this advert, so cheesy, gross
We are Maltesers we can say whatever we want about disabled people as long as we get disabled people to say it.
Before this advert aired I didn't realise that disableds were able to eat Maltesers. Thank you Maltesers for opening my eyes.
I lost it omgg
is this what the world has come to
"Shorty at the crib she taking it in like a go-getter Full course meal, I'ma get that money in the tummy make room coming soon" ~ YouTube Ad (shameful hypocrites) #demonetized
Yes it's a good advert in concept but regardless of disabilities, the implied ending is completely inappropriate.
is this raoe
this is brilliant !!! Zillion thnx :)
This advert is actually really funny! like I usually cringe at advert humour, supprised a big company like maltesers would be this playful and edgy
Barb from Stranger Things, anyone?
very funny. they took a risk I like that
i like it tho.
ok, so this ad is allowed but they ban one for showing a girls leg? lunatics.
I'm here from the pussycast.
Do you like your chocolate balls with cream?
I dont get it, like what has sex go to do with malteasers? xD just seems so random, I guess it does its job at grabbing viewers attention
This is like Loose women but in an advert
Vote Trump.
I was hoping stomedy would be in it
these have to be down right my favourite ads ever. they have innuendoes to them, and are genuinely fun, but at the same time it doesnt actually feel like they are offending or making fun of Disability
I watch this when I eat Malteserd you feel like you are in paradise!!         Lol
Awesome ad! Diversity is always welcome :)
This needs covering on the last leg, #thelastleg
Brilliant advert, wickedly funny. Great to see Storme Toolis on our screens, but who is the girl with the dark hair, I feel like I've seen her somewhere before, but I can't place her?
Funny and brilliant.
looks so wrong
Oh Jesus wept this is gonna piss of so many people
Is this ad watershed cuz it's too sexually charged despite how potentially liberating it is
Brilliant advert.
This is so brilliant made me laugh so much and really impressed with the exposure of disability :)
An ad with a joke that would skip over the heads of children and make adults die of laughter I Love it
ha, that was funny.
this will go right over kids heads lol
I love how this is so naughty. like adults and so on would get this haha
This ad is amazing
An ad that normalises disabled people? Freaking awesome!
Actually have a box of Maltesers in my fridge right now. #whenabagisnotenough
Pleasantly surprised to see Storme whilst waiting for a video to load. Good to see you're still doing well.
Amazing! This made my week. Funniest thing I've seen   in absolutely ages. well done!
Ha, this was brilliant!
Well done Maltesers on so many levels. I love this to death. #realworldsex
Absolutely brilliant :-)
Is that Sophie turner
The girl in the ponytail kind of looks like Amanda Bynes
k but i love this
Brilliant. Well done.
This ad rocks!
This is right at so many levels
this was wayyyyy funnier than that old maltesers ad with the male strippers. that one was cringe.
*the Maltesers fall on the table*  *Dan Howell screaming in the distance*
this is great
Funny ad :)
Good advert, about time we recognised people with disabilities as people first - so sex (shock horror) can be part of the equation!
That's a cool ad actually and the disabled actress is very good.
LOOOL.  Great ad
Hahahahahahaah this is great. everyone is so pg lately so this is quite refreshing.
So happy about these adverts!

Here is the first Trailer for Marvel´s The Defenders. Who is going to watch this?
nirvana all the way baby!
wheres kanye west?
Now this right here? I CAN'T WAIT! Netflix is king... or queen!
They REALLY screwed up with the Iron Fist. They made him such a whiny pussy!
WAS THAT ELEKTRA!!!!!
It all sucks. I read the book. The director is shit. I know more than they do. I hate it. It's bad. Not enough black, Asian, Latin, women, LGBQT... have I covered it all?
did they really just use Nirvana as the theme song ?
iron fist still a liittle bitch
Endless trash!
Ive waited so long to see "Blind Ninja and Stick" again. Was wondering when we see them again
Oh,Niervana```I miss Cobain
Daredevil is the bet one but his head is big
IBTL !!!! Nice... I will be first in line to see this ..... even if it is in my own house !
And here I thought someone punched Kanye.
what is the outro song called
Meh. Oh, and leave Nirvana out of this
What she says in the end? My english is bad.
Anyone else thought the music sounds like Nirvana Come as you are
looks great, even if the white fist is in it
Yes a movie
Nirvana music by far the best part.
everything fine until iron fist shows up.
Meh *shrugs*
I'm the Immortal Ironfist!!!
will there still be solo seasons of Dare Devil?
Hope he will mention even more that he's the Iron Fist! kappa
Looks awesome!
This movie is going to be sick! :D
I thought I was gonna hear come as you are by Nirvana.
Is it possible to jizz out of every hole on my body, because I'm pretty sure I just did.
I can only get so erect
I thought she had super strenght can't she just break out?
RACIST THUMBNAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YESSS!!!!! THE HYPE!!!
Looks pretty good!
"I'm the immortal Iron Fist." "You wot?"
Sigourney Weaver? Dammit, now I have to watch this for sure.
Yes yes yes yes and yes
"Whatever it is you are"  -- lololol
would it be to much to ask if this guys be featured in some of the Marvel movies to come
I clicked because the picture looked like a picture of Kanye West getting punched in the face.
Luke cages reaction to "I am the immortal ironfist" 😂😂 10/10
this looks so generic and boring...
the detective doesn't even compare to these guys. Punisher needs to take her spot.
The real question is can it be as bad as the 4 shows were individually
how is this a marvel movie??? i m disappointed
Elektra is so cool in this. Walking like a Boss battle ready to happen. Reminds of Rinzler with Madara Uchiha suit, unstoppable.
Where's the PUNISHER??😡😡
this should just be a movie
I wonder if the Hand has a new Burrakku Skai yet.
NO NO NO GOD PLEASE NO NO NOOOOOOOOOO NOT "COME AS YOU ARE" YOU CAN NOT USE A LEGENDARY SONG FOR YOUR SUB PAR SHIT SHOW, AND NO PUNISHER WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ARE U DOING -5/10
I only clicked because I thought that thumbnail Shows Kanye West being punched in the face🤔
This is a series I can believe in!
Anybody else catch Electra?
the song tho❤
Hallway fight, had to happens, Netflix made that a staple, and this one already looks like it's gonna be good, i dig this trailer, a whole fucking lot.
punisher better be in this
Best Movie , and a fuck your dc
The money shot looks so cheesy, tf is danny doing at the back while JJ throws a weak ass punch?  Not very convincing lol
Eeeeeeeee baby
Just send the Punisher in..
That awkward moment when daredevil looks more like iron fist than iron fist do.
they dropped the ball with iron fist ,but i hope defe'nde'rs make it
Ok, I will wach just because of Segourney...
I see Luke and Clair finally got that coffee
Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!
Less Jessica Jones more Luke Cage and Iron FIst and no Hogarth unless they kill that cunt.
Thumbnail looked like Kanye West getting punched, that's something I'd pay to see.
MUTHA...FUCKING HALLWAY FIGHT X4!!! 😃😃😃
dam wasn't going to watch this til Sigourney weaver showed up
The trailer was decent, but did they have to butcher a good song?
Marvki Pi is SOOOOO correct The Punisher better make an appearance or there will be HELL to PAY!
Marvel Copy my homework but dont DC  make it look the same DCS LEGENDS OF TOMORROW
please do not rape nirvana like that
Show of hands who wants to see now
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK
this looks insane
I only clicked this because the thumbnail looked like Kanye getting punched.
what's the Outro song? they didn't put it in  the disruption or at the end of the video?
I don't get it!? It's New York!!! Where the fuck is the avengers!!??
The cringe is realllllllll
He`s not Ironfist until he puts on that damn green and yellow outfit!
aww come on. What's with the censorship BS?
Why censor it? This is the Internet damnit we wanna know all the inappropriate things!
5:32 nice Gus laugh from Matt
so jeremys answer was holocaust right?
its official Jeremy hates jews, ryan even called him on the shit over a oven comment, on the next segment.
It it bad for the pizza one I thought "you Jews it ,we cook it "
It's like Jackbox, but without all the... good.
I wanna know what the first clip was from
11:10 - "X GONNA GRANDMA TO YA!"
i'm all for censorship but it's fucking dumb the stuff that these guys censor
Trevor: "Did you really have difficulty with the gender of this person?" the tone was perfect.
The room code was almost my name. Ermehgurd.
"Make up a new British word for "Penis"" cue 5 different variations of "Gavin Free" being typed until Ryan calls it out
I really hope Jeremy's German word for a romantic evening was Kristallnacht
Why is no one mentioning BrentalFloss?
I'm sitting here, eating pepperoni slices and drinking cream soda...
Lmao I'm really curious as to what those answers were.
please stop censoring yourselves
I actually want to know what the movie that first clip came from is.
funhaus wouldn't have censored it.
Holy shit! Yes Ryan! Yay. Take that Jack.
glad I clicked on this 1. lol
This is Brentalfloss's game guys
The censor is funny in its own way but man does it suck to miss out on the joke
In quiplash they made fun of the audience being baited and picking 'immature' answers but here there's no audience and the humour is mostly just that.  Js.
Hey, I just saw that movie used in the first clip...
Bork is from SWEDISH chef ffs.
Dislike for censoring WORDS. Fucking Americans.
Why would you have to blur words? Does the company not own itself sort of speak?
Good to see 'Granny Gumjobs' is back. :P
WHAT ARE WE DOIN GEOFF
"I like the location of this daycare center, I just don't like that it's called Funhaus Abortion Clinic"
Hey! Brentalfloss's game! :D
What a shit game
I hope they play this again sometime. This was great
Its annoying when your favorite people can't even be funny because they are scared of political backlash
I swear one of the things Jeremy wrote is furry related.
maybe there should add to the wiki what the bleeps were. No triggered non hardcore achievement hunter fans would go to the wiki
this just feels like a watered down version of jackbox
Ryan referenced Jeremy's answer in the next game, "I'm noticing a trend... I'm gonna assume it's oven based maybe."   Enjoy figuring that censor bar out.
censoring the words kills it.
The traditional German word for "romantic evening" is... kristallnacht!
i talk to my girlfriend today and im sure if i can win her back or i lost her...
You know it's Rooster Teeth when they say I'm surprised there's so little bukkake
this isnt as good as jackbox, not even close
So who else sees the mouse on the top left?
I was more than halfway in before I noticed the holes in the punch cards are in the shape of a dinosaur 😂
what movie is the scene of the doctor and the woman from? I swear i've watched that movie on a rainy sunday night...
Very disappointed no one entered 'Blitzkrieg' at 13:51
is there a uncensored version of this somewhere? would love to see it!
Who immediately thought bukkake at 3:50
Great Video Guys!!!  Ep. 2!!!
I really want to know what was censored!
is the romantic evening one the Holocaust? because its the first thing that came in to my head and i feel bad.
Can you do another one of these? There's not that many Lets Players out there doing this game XD
with the blacked out words. and any other "naughty words" or funny shit. make LetsPlay bloopers. it'll be hilarious
Welp that's that then...Ryan does words good....
3:40 it wasn't me, it was a spooky ghost! 7:20 Pedro's Pedos 11:30 Grandmother of 8 gives gumjob to ghost of JFK
Is anyone else more terrified of the AH crew than they were before?
i really wonder what they couldve said that needed censored... id guess jeremys was aushwitz or blitzkrieg trevors though no clue
I'm glad Granny Gumjobs made itinto this viddeo
I always used to hate Trevor, but I gotta say, I've grown to love him since Geoff died.
9:40 FOREVER UNCLEEEEAAN
There's a mouse in the top left corner.  I'm sorry I've done this to you.
Nope, not as good as the JackBox games. Stick to the classics.
I would've gone with fid kuckers
I really hope you guys play this game some more.
You're boring if you censor things. Just go with it, being offended is a choice.
Jeremy i would have written "Using the ovens since 1939" or "Ovens so good Germany borrowed them during the 40's"
it was auschwitz wasn't it
fill in the blank for daycare inmediatley thought the Third Reich
I like the location of this daycare center, I just don't like that it's called Subway.
 more Trevor! gotta say he's a nice  fill in
Oh man it was definitely Auschwitz...
Did Dr. Evil write the tutorial in the first minute?  You're about to see a film clip that's "missing a subtitle" etc.
Play this a ton more. But with less shitty people. And we're grown ups. Get rid of the censorship.
More please. This is fun
I like the location of this daycare center, I just don't like that it's called Comet Ping Pong.
So many things they're okay with putting on the Internet and yet they still bar stuff out. it's obviously funny, so if we're the audience we usually are, we'll think it's funny too
so i'm pretty sure jeremy said kike
i just got home from surgery i dislocated my wrist and shattered my radius. thank you guys for being here in my time of need. love yal!!
So when the prompt for "New British Word for Penis" came up, how many people thought Gavin. Had to be at least 80% of the people watching this.
Diddle Me Kinder and Our Sauce Is Blood Based, were my top choices.
what did he say
I like the location of this daycare, I just don't like that it's called... Planned parenthood.
Is the Narrator Dr Steel?
How did they censor Holocaust but not Hitler was right?
I like the location of this daycare center, I just don't like that it's called Subway
why are you censoring shit it makes me so fucking angry?
the romantic German night one was probably Kristallnacht...
Trevor Is so annoying
The Jackson-Fogle experience for the daycare question
So Jeremy's answer for the German question that was censored was "holocaust", right?
no guns drawn and everyone goes home peacefully. imagine if this was in america..bang bang bang
And the DNC wants to open that can of shit to our country
This is the price for opening the gate to Muslim asswipes
Thanks for the uploads. Big American fan here, Feenix, keep 'em coming. These shows provide terrific & sometimes appalling insight into contemporary England. Thanks!
this was humorous
Liberalism has destroyed Europe so bad that even the police are prohibited from carrying a firearm.
Try this bullshit in South Africa, and you will be eating lead. Our cops dont fuck around.
JUST FUCKING SHOOT THE filthy pigs
i find it rather funny UK is such a develope nation and yet the kax un rules n Laws is appaling
lol bragging about ANPR. Australia has had this for over a handful of years
always fucking ragheads stirring it up.... Europe is blessed with all those "immigrants"
The cars blocking police vehicles why were they not given a fine for obstruction?
Fat boy in the orange would have been pepper sprayed and tased.
Wow. Here in the US, half of those people would have been shot in the first five minutes.
or have you just posted them if so have they been  on here before
are these new on tv
Typical Muslims....worst Cancer Europe ever had to deal with.
The commentator - Jamie Theakston - is how I imagine Richard Hammond will look when he grows up ;-)
In the u.s.a. all that scums would be gunpointed in a few seconds.
Foreign scum! We should reinstate the death penalty for these people. There is no other solution.
oh look the Muslim police come out of their houses.... the police should smack the shit into them!
When you see evidence of the low mentality of these people, you realise why they need a tough, even brutal, government to keep them under control.
*strained relations with the police = culturally enriched area.*
"high tension area" lol you mean a muslim ghetto
fucking Pakistani cunts dirty pigs
This is how a invasion off savages look like, and respond with power or get destroyed by it!
What a disgrace, bunch of yobs.
Aaawww, I was looking forward to homefront. :(
What is the point ... these thugs will get off as usual !
It certainly looks the time for MI5, Special Branch, Anti-Terrorist Agency to pay that place a visit - even better send in the Tax Officers. The type of behaviour you have come to expect.
I hope this is not a Muslim no go zone  police are not aloud there. they will be in trouble as British law do's not applie Muslims
If the people don't want the police there, the next time there is a crime big or small the police should just refuse to go. I know who they will blame, but where does the fault really lie.
Thanks for sharing these! You are awesome.
Bradford has a real problem. Where the hell are their parents to educate those feral idiots.
take the registration of all cars blocking in the police and go back later and confiscate them
Thank-You .... Your the BEST :)
thank u  :)
SUOMI PERKELE!
This is why enforcers should have never been took out of the game
Niskanen was just in wrong position at wrong time bwoah
Ovechkin and Niskanen should both be fined.
Karma at its finest..all the times he faked or milked penalties hope hes out for the rest of the season!!!
SUOMI PERKELE!!
Crosby is going to be a vegetable by the time he's 65.
I'm a leaf fan sadly they got out of the playoffs from Washington but I am a Pittsburgh Penguins fan to
he was going to take the famous Crosby dive  after the slash !
Filthy dirty play by Niskanen.
What goes around comes  around...
Did not look intentional, looked like he was trying to catch himself and brace for the impact and the other happened to fall before reaching him, bad luck
I thought the thumbnail was them kissing.
I hope they lose and get a find
He's faking
I'm utterly outraged! Washington should be disqualified! Going for the literal kill in the playoffs.... poor Crosby. Good god he does not deserve that.
Niskanen shouldn't have gotten a penalty because he simply just raised his hands up and Crosby slid into them, Ovechkin on the other hand should have gotten a penalty as he tried to kill crosby
1:55 I do like the other player. He holds Crosby :)
That was an accident only should've been a 5 minute
Crosby sits when he pees
why the hell was Niskanen going for a Cross check any way, a cross check is illegal in Hockey
At least it wasn't McJesus.
How did no one mention about the dude who hit him with the stick
just wait theirs next year's conccusion
Crosby also slashed someone's finger off
It's so much worse when you watch it in super slo mo it looks like a hockey hit in normal motion
They need a Goon
So little talk about Ovechkin's dirty shot that causes this. So the entire city is a ghetto, and the team plays ghetto. Got it. Someone should give him a serious injury.
That's probably his last game.
For the things He's done to other Players, like slashing the private area, he deserves this 😎
Dirty bastard deserved it.
The power people have the power disease.  The only cure is Care.  Be the Care today.
He just got knocked the FUG out
If it wasn't Crosby, this would be 2 mins, and a non-issue. Completely incidental.
its a dangerous sport.
completely on purposes both thos players should be Fired
I wonder if mia khalifa is happy
if you're over 12 and still in to sports on a cult level you're a severely disabled human being
Crosby fell before the UN CALLED FOR PLAY...that could have been avoided😡
Looked like he was about to flop with that first stick to the arm, then he got the real thing to the face. Serves him right.
what a dooshbag! suspend 'em fer good!!!!!
he deserves it, he chopped a guys finger off
Kinda funny, when the penalty notification came to top center of the screen, it say "Matt Niskanen" but actually it's Matti Niskanen.
ovey should be playing baseball
NOT a malicious hit, deserving of a penalty, sure, but I do not believe he was targeting Sid's head.
Man, what a DEADLY slash.... at least no one lost a finger.
Ayyyy number 3 on trending
Smart move by him to be honest, gotta do what you gotta do to win.
LOL SO MANY VIEWS
AND... the Oscar for best performance in the 2017 NHL Playoffs goes to...
makes it that much easier for the oilers to potentially win the cup
Ovechkin is the only one to blame! He swung his stick like he was chopping down a tree. Niskanen was basically just there to stop Crosby from flying into the boards, the damage was done by Ovechkin.
Best player in the word injured
This is why hockey isn't relevant. There was no reason he even needed to attempt to check Crosby.
This is the only Washington can win
Disgusting play
football and basketball have more respectable players
Good thing Crosby didn't get hit in the vagina.
video starts at 1:30
What would 88 Eric Lindros say.....
THIS IS IRRELEVANT BUT I NEED SURVEY RESPONSES FOR SCHOOL,PLEASE HELP ME I ONLY NEED 25 RESPONSES LINK: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CY7R5H5
Looks like straight up accident.
love how everyone is not talking about or still cant see the slew foot from Ovi
Woo he thinks he a dominator in the field i challenge this dickhead to meet me.
Sid is gonna be a crazy old man with all the concussions he's had
this i what u get for being a dirty player
Matt niskanen should be suspended for cross-checking Sidney Crosby in the head while he was falling on the ice
I'm glad someone did that to Crosby
2nd on trending
suspend both of them indefinitely
Nice of the jerk who cross checked him upside the head to come see if he's ok. Wasn't it?
thats a dirty hit
Niskanen knew what he was doing, that's why he's pretending not to notice. Hockey has so much acting these days and you inbred fans just play it off as purely incidental.
Crosby dived into the stick lol
He's made enough to retire.
one of the best movie

Isnt it closer to the S8?
MT video are not funny. don't try to be funny talking about these cars. If we want to watch a fun show, we can watch top gear/grand tour. Just do some proper reviews, comedies are not your cup of tea
what happens when we run out battery juice, thanks tesla
Love the crap challenge, Tesla wins, every time!  Audi is a beautiful car but, old technology with much, much older fuel.  Tesla's the future.
Tesla is amazing but I would not buy it because it looks horrific witch is disappointing.
The Audi is so much better driving experience than that golf cart
This show is what american top gear should be like just with a bigger budget
Try FF 91 ;)
Hope this video doesn't get you busted for being on the phone while driving
I've really not liked Tesla because I'm a muscle car fan and it beats them so often but one thing that occurred to me is that a family car that's faster than nearly every other car is American. That's pretty cool.
"That you exist!" Great line...the banter between you guys is getting more natural and funny the more of these episodes you do.
Pretty nice Video. I love all of the cars but the Turbo S is my favourite
absolutly love the tesla but my heart lays with the audi RS7 both cars are amazing and cant go wrong with eather car
I hear one difference. Tesla is damn louder inside. I'ts not Audi quality yet.
I'm german and we have a lot of 100-120 kph speedlimits. And if not most of the time it is too much traffic to go full gas.
The Nissan Patrol from Dubai would defer whose world's fastest 😂
With all major players joining the EV game, Tesla won't be happy for long.
Something inside me doesnt want electric cars to succeed. I mean i get saving the environment etc, but there is something to said about gas powered engines and its sad to see the end of an era. Is it just me?
The tesla in America costs $135000. Double it and you have the price in Australian dollars
A sport version of Tesla p100d would be unbeatable they wouldn't need to add more power  just remove some weight  like a Tesla Coupe , no sound insolation and lighter batteries
The audio in the tesla sucked
What do you mean 4 doors? You mean 5 right? And you are forgetting Rimac is fastest EV not Tesla. And yes America should increase the speed limits like in Europe FFS!
dodge demon! *heavy breathing
Audi RS7 - Who are you?   Tesla Model S P100d - I'm you but stronger!
The Tesla will fall apart. Just look at the massive panel gaps between door and B-pillar. That kind of build quality can't last long.
Can you do a review of the Panamera Turbo Hybrid , when it's available ? and maybe comparing it with one of these two?
I'm surprised they didn't say anything about the sound really. Who likes to listen to a constant whine inside a car when you can hear a thunderous v8 through a tunnel...
that chick with flags tho
Yea it is not fastest because Rimac concept one from Croatia beats it! :) You have video on yt
Although I enjoyed the video, it seemed like you picked the winner and then selected tests that would validate the result. Charging stations alone are a major limitation. 
RS7 MY DREAM .. even the tesla is bater in other way .. i think the comparison is unfair, Because the rs7 is older than tesla in model ..
The tesla sounds SO good!! .. oh wait
What about all the toxic chemicals used to make the plastics and batteries in the Tesla?
The Audi is build for the Autobahn not for American highways ... we simply just don't care about American Highways...
what's with the audio in the Tesla on the highway ?
13:33 omg the road noise in the Tesla sounds horrible
See that headliner in the RS7...  £2000.
Dodge Viper ACR.... LoL, whut?
Demon can take the Tesla (: 1.08 G's off line
16:49 19:52
Audi all day long! That RS7 is the sexiest car ever!!!
twin turbo v8 vs vibrator??? how is this considered a question?
Who has 22 minutes and 21 seconds to find out the answer to this QUESTION?
LIVE, LOVE, LAUGH & DIE  Simple..😏
I dont like AUDI, or any german cars for that mater, but the RS7 is by far the most beautiful sedan on the roads today, and I applaud AUDI for it.
Wait till they test the Dodge Demon
Tesla should cost half that. Ridiculous considering they have gotten 4.9 billion of American Taxpayer dollars. So half the price for Americans and full price for everyone else.
at highway speeds the tesla does NOT have a range of 300 miles...
I bet the Autobahn's roads is in way better condition than those. That is the main reason why they allow you to do  300kmh on them.
literally the best car show atm.
What are the rules for using phone when driving in the US? MT channel & salomondrin use mobiles freelance
6:05 completely disagree... looks  like a big rectangle installed in the middle of the interior.. it doesn't feet with the rest of the interior
There is ZERO evidence that co2 causes climate change btw!! Stop using these vids as political means!!
I much prefer the open grill for the Tesla than the mouth guard thing.
This show would be a billion times better with Lucky and Tony hosting it.   These guys try way too hard to be funny and they're not. Especially all the racist stuff they do.
That white interior is going to age so badly.
what's tha point of fast sedan without V8? what's tha point of 150k sedan without tons of leather inside and comfortable ride ? that audi makes only one thing worse than tesla - acceleration
I'll take RS7 all day. people who would take Tesla is either vegan or hermaphrodite that doesn't appreciate the rumbling sounds of car exhaust.
no one wants to see their faces show the interiors!!!
Everybody forgets that Tesla is relatively new, while Audi has been around for decades
hot lap!!!!!!!
Belong merely opposite eaqhrd Italian array location ship questionnaire.
Wait what? I feel like audi interior are so underwhelming vs its competitors, specially mercedes benz
my next car is Tesla. no more German cars for me.
Great review and as always they are really funny. Please, please pretty please, make a Head To Head Comparo between the 2017 Maserati Levante S and the 2017 Porsche Cayenne GTS.  It should be a blast!!!
Porsche's are just something else.
I love the Tesla, but it's as if there was some bias towards it at the end. No real explanation or reason given for it to be the winner. It's the winner because it can run in a vacuum? You can't be serious, right?
5:49 were you trying to sound like trump there? haha
Germany(Audi) vs America(Tesla). Who won?
Tesla P100D for World's Best Drag Race 7?
Bruh I'm the rs7gram on Instagram and I have nothing but mad RESPECT for Tesla. Fuck the rivalry, I'll add a tesla to my garage any day now.
Why are these videos not in 4K???

Has anyone noticed how the lamp on the table in Sister location that you can see during the vampire love story tv show , is the same one in the left hallway in Fnaf 4
So when is the movie coming out? I'm confused.
I think afton was kept in a asylum and escaped and he suffers from narcissism and plans it all to where the animatronics will kill
If the bite is what caused everything, id assume its the bite of '83
2:41 OH GOD NO
He still does these?
MIND F*****G BLOWN.
But MatPat, William didn't build freadbear. Henry did! Go recalculate!!!
do a theory on limbo plz anyone with me?
*Stares silently with jaw dropped in horror*
Video unmonetized because it contained the word "bite" in the title
notification squad
you are a merderar
I always thought that the science based episode were much more interesting and even educational. lore is nice and all but I like this a lot more
*sees john* *fangirls like crazy* I love this whole episode
I was focused on the  realistic editing...what were we talking about?
dude, FNAF is dead...
Afton wasn't the one who designed the suits though, it was Henry. I'm pretty sure Afton didn't even have any involvement with the restaurants until after Fredbear's, i.e. AFTER the springlock suits.
What if the next book says something different? Wouldn't you have to overthink your theory?
if you think about it aften is sending mesagees to scott that his creations killed his
I thought it bit down on his neck, hence his head being in the mouth not on the teeth
Matpat, in Sister Location what if Baby has been to the scooping room before she speaks to you on night 5 and it is just her body on the conveyer? Ennard may have just mimicked her voice as he is in the room with you...
Do a little nightmares theory 😇😇
Matpat will you please do an Outlast 2 episode. The ending was so bad i think we need clarification of what happened and WHY
Wait I thought the other owner did the designing
12:50 that number should be doubled, as we are only seeing one side of the animatronic.
I know I'm not the only that has never or only once or twice played a FNAF game but I always watch these videos
#SOPROUDOFPUN
still waiting for that botw timeline theory
Haven't watched a game theory in a minute! I thought they stopped doing them and went on to completely unrelated things
Woah woah let me give a theory (sister location)     So why is sister location has the word 'sister?'   THE END
Matpat will you do more gamelab I loved it
When you die in Sister location an you pause the video you can see 2 eyes.And when you tilt your phone to see (his down spot)then you see a round object like the puppet
maybe the conversation isnt with animatronics and purple huy maybe its just in animatronics rebelling against their leader  puppet or goldy my guess
Can you do another Hello Neighbor theory since Alpha 4 is out?
i found in the its no dream theory that the phone guy said in fnaf 3 that there were springlock failures from the SISTER LOCATION
plz do the time line early plz I can't wait
i love how you edit your videos.
"Chuky cheese wanna be" ME:im dying😂😂
Shouldn't it be 16 teeth though?
"We were wrong!"  No. You were wrong.
I swear to Satan FNAF has to hurry up and die!
what's the video in the beginning..?
What's the beginning about again? I'm reallly fonfused
MatPat can you do a game theory on my favorite game Titanfall 2?
Hey Mat, you could've used the WHAT ARE THOOOOSE! meme when you said 'What are those?'
outlast 2 or nothing
This just gives me more reason to be hyped for the book's release ^=^
I've got to say seeing the original game theory intro made me feel old but happy. I grew up with you and that really hit me with nostalgia.Love u MatPat
Just a question: 'Could you do a theory on little nightmares?' Because it's awesome and i'd love if you would a theory on it, don't worry it's scary and creepy. >;)
What was the clip in the beginning? I tried looking it up and I can't find it
plz do a tattle tale and Stanley parable theory
Exotic butters....
So.....are you doing the extra scene from sister location
I'd recommend doing a theory on Little Nightmares. There is a lot of questions in the game hopefully you could shed some light on them.
since we can only see it from one side and teeth are from both sides and since one side had 8 teeth he has 16 teeth in total
You should do Outlast 2
hey i think the pressure thingy instrument poped up i know that but i think the head was too much heavy
Can you do an episode on psychopaths, or maybe the joker?
You should go back to this style of video. Science is so much more interesting than lore
god damn your an amazing theorists!! XD
Henry bilut the animatronics
Dude how do u do all this stuff ur like amazing
But actin didn't make the animatronics,it was his partner Henry,well guess it's time for another uodate
the endosckelton
wouldn't he actually die instantly
I love cookies <3
does anyone know where I can get some pizza
Matpat  Has trouble saying vajina Has a video on best gaming boobs  🤔🤔🤔
well the pizzeria has a lot to say
youre awesome all hail game theory
hey GT will you do 1 on sup ?
I literally just made an account like 3 minutes ago and I'm so happy because now I can show my support to the channels I love like game theory 😁😁😁😁
this isnt mass effect...... oh how i love waiting 4 years for a part 2
Getting punched in the Temple can kill you, Or can make you retarded
*BUT THAT'S JUST A THEORY. A GAME THEORY.*
I love youre opening
You know, I would like to see the slender men still

I wish you would say or edit how much products are so I don't have to go search it up every time 😩 first world problems
$70 for a mascara.... ouch. It looks nice but I also feel like other mascaras have gave you the same look? I don't know which one however, but I agree I think you will like it more once it dries out a bit.
You make me laugh, Kathleen Lights.
Here in France we get 25% off at sephora ALL THE TIME !
Hi from South Africa! you are undoubtedly my favorite You Tuber.. everything about you.. you're absolutely adorable..
I LOVE YOU SOOO MUCH, GIRL YOU WORK HARD BUY WHAT YOU WANT! YOU EARNED IT!
Girl you need to try It cosmetics superhero eslastic stretch mascara. It's the best.
OMG the first thing I notice when watching your video is your lashes, they look insanely long !!
Kathleen,  I noticed your lashes from the jump! The mascara works beautifully!  "The sale makes me do crazy things"😂😂
I think that other mascaras look do same to your lashes.  You don't need that one
Lou-Wee-Boo-Ton - LOL
Kathleen you are so adoreable. Don't EVER disappear from my life. I allow breaks but I need to see you every now and then :D   Much love ❤️
You are too cute, love how simple you are!
Do you like the blushing margarita shade  of gloss more than white russian?
the mascara doesn't look like anything special I feel like drugstore has done better for you
Loooveee your look!! The hoops,lashes chuuu hair!😍 the fresh flirty face!!!  I hope/wish can do this tutorial on this look your rocking!🦄🌸
It's so funny how you can just watch someone on YouTube and think you are actually friends. Haha this is how I am when I watch you Kathleen your amazing and I love you! ❤️
Kathleen I 1000000% thought your lashes looked different/soooo long when I started watching!
Holy crap, the bloopers about the shirt are too funny!! I cannot wear those shirts even though they look sooooo cute. Kathleen is the best.
This is going to sound weird but you have the cutest little ears!!! 👂👂👂👂
I peed myself when you said "the stabber" 😂😂😂
The classic red with the black stabber lolol
I have to say I noticed your lashes at the beginning of the video.  I thought they looked amazing!
Kathleen, you look like a Barbie doll! I meant that as a compliment. I know you favor warm tones but when you wear baby pinks, you look SO pretty!!! That top is so cute on you
love your earrings 😍❤ and you have such good energy, I watch your videos regardless. send you a big hug ❤
HEY KATHLEEN! Can you do a Bridal tutorial please! LOVE YOU
i feel like i've seen your lashes better with other mascaras xx
I love how your eyelashes look! 👀
I've gotten better lashes from a $4.99 Essence mascara.
you look absolutely stunning in this video 😍
Before you said anything, I was thinking how I loved your eyelashes. 🙈
about the lashes...first thing I noticed in this video! Before you even talked about the mascara, the whole video I kept noticing your lashes.
please do a review on em cosmetics lip cloud by michelle phan😍😍
can you try the bourjois mat illusion bronzing powder i saw it from estee lalonde's
Your lashes look like you're wearing falsies. Amazing.....not worth it...but amazing lmao
No joke that mascara seems to do exactly the same thing than a cheap cover girl mascara. You paid for the brand name and the packaging. You still look gorgeous though 😉
You should do a favourite mascaras video!
I think Tati tested those crappy nail polish lol and it's not worth the money
coola BB cream and primer are fantastic products, great ingredients and ideal for summer and no makeup makeup looks. I thought you were going to play with that laboutin nail polish like you were a unicorn!! 🦄
Have you tried the Christophe Robin scrub shampoo? It's like the new Brigeo one but way more intense, haha.
honestly your lashes look great. and you can buy whatever luxury products you want, it's your money. as long as you're not going into debt or something then who cares, spend it how you like, treat yourself.
I think the mascara looks bomb on you! the first thing i did when i started watching was to go down in the description to see what mascara you were wearing
"How extra are you?" *Holds up nail polish bottle* "Jesus Christ"
when you miss the sale cus you're waiting for your tax return.....but you don't get it until the day after the sale ends.... rip :(
I think your eyelashes look awesome! But that price 😬 I feel like I can get the same results with an eyelash curler and L'Oréal Telescopic :)
the mascara didnt do much :/ love you kathleen 💕
And yeap, I've seen your lashes like that million times Kath 😂
Literally the first thing I thought when I started this video was how awesome your lashes looked! Not $75 worth, but they're so pretty!
Your little accents crack me up so much!
I noticed your lovely lashes at the beginning of the video - pretty. (Try Loo-boo-tan without making too much of the n)
honestly on other people i didn't think it was good but that louboutin mascara looks FREAKING GOOD on you like wow!! never seen your lashes this long maybe more voluminous but never this long
which loving tan product is your favorite? im looking to try it
I'm going to prom and this is such a nice natural look, post a make up tutorial!!!
Kathleen please post a make up tutorial on this look!!!
Jeffree did a video about that mascara and said it wasn't worth it either
this makeup look with this outfit gives me LIFE
hmmm I prefer better than sex mascara, dasss expensive girl:(
the remover wipe usually has 25%/30% off on the SkinStore website.
Just think of that nail polish as a home protection device. You could really hurt someone with that packaging!
What's the point of watching it after the sale... and I watched the whole thing 😍😍
This look is so RADIANT. OMG. You look so beautiful!
The first thing I thought when I watched the video was, "What is on her lashes?!".  So yeah, I noticed the mascara.  It looks great on you.
I just want to hang out in your beauty room
Anyone else think "I wish I was her mom"  ? 😀
In Greece Sephora sales are at least 3 times a year..so come and visit whenever you want💕
Try using the Micro-Fil powder as a finishing powder to buff at the very end of your makeup!!
Please do an update on how the products worked out for you!!
The sale makes me do crazy things lmaaooooo and ur shirt mishap hahahaha. They really are cute in theory but it sucks to keeep off the shoulder haha
The heart wants what it wants 🎶 I think I would have bought that same mascara if I had seen how beautiful the packaging is, TBH 😍
360 spray means you can spray the bottle at any angle, even upside down.  You don't have to hold the bottle straight up. 😁
I have seen you eyelashes look better with other mascaras, not worth $70 :D
I also like rachel thought immediately when I turned on the video your lashes looked amazing. but also I think your lashes have looked that great before! I LOVE the lenght!!
Bet some old asian dude bought her Vibe!
Before you even mentioned anything about expensive products, I immediately thought your lashes looked AMAZING. I definitely notice a difference!
I stg I thought u had falsies
360 spray means you can hold the can at any angle and it will spray! 😂
your video made me laugh!! in a good way of course.... just towards the ending when you talk about your pricey purchases ;) haha. glad to see you back on youtube <3
360* spray means that it will spray no matter what angle it is!
so we just gone act like Bron hairline didn't bounce back
When you got a billion dollars, doesn't matter how much the fine is
Lbj not only give a lot of gifts to his brothers he also pay their damn fine! 👏👏👏
Real reason they got him to the cavs so he can injure dubnation lmao
A fine for what!?!? Talking shit on the court???? Are you kidding me ?
Lebron was cool about paying the fine . media be making it seem like he was pissed and trying to start beef with his own players .
don't let this distract you from the fact that i'm a homosexual
I wonder if LeBrons wife got mad like damn  nigga stop paying other niggas  fines we need the money lol
What a guy!! But I hate that jones guy..Man tried to end Kobe's career in 2 separate instances..
Cleveland think they slick watch what I tell you this guy will be fighting in the finals with clay or draymond. They picked him up 2 be a crash dummy lol
kick that dumbass stupid danthay Jones,
why tf is dahntay jones even playing lmao nigga could be earning more money working a footlocker selling Js
don't let this distract you from the warriors blew a 3-1 lead
He makes 30 Mill lol 9k ain't nothing to him 😂
My brotha bron bron got the fresh cut before the interview, looking real light up there folk.
80 dollars That's like a nickel to lebron 😂😂😂😂
so looking forward to the humility coming lebron's way in the finals
That's what friends are for!!!
Lebron is a bitch Bruh  #Dubnation
He earned the fine so he should pay for it

Dad: Why don't you go play outside.  Me: 3:51
start a gaming channel
Hey guys I just built my own Xbox one s, I plugged in some cables
Me*playing Ps4*  Mom:go and get some fresh air  Me: *plays Ps4 outside with this setup*
I think I'll stick to my Switch
is this for xbox one to?
FUCK YOU BITCH ASSHOLE I FUCKING HATE YOU ASS FACE
Damn console peasants, just build a damn pc noobs
So what you're telling me is that I can game for 4 hours straight on that? Awesome!
Here's a better idea... Buy a gaming laptop and don't waste your money
When your mom tells you to go outside 😂
Why is everything SO FICKING EXPENSIVE (its a joke... i know why)
rlly make this
make a ps2 ultimate setup :)))😂
what about internet on it ??
Or you could just get a Nintendo Switch
why not just buy a laptop with a graphics card
Good video but WRONG title very  misleading, should be how to power Gaems on the go or similar. You did not build anything! I was expecting you too take ps4 part make it inbuilt with the Gaems.
Would be better to spend money on a gaming laptop that this crap.
Big fan of Ps4 but cannot   buy due to poorty ..plzzz help us ....for donation u r looking kind heart Person Contact 918295750515
how about buying a ps vita and use remote play so you dont have to bring your ps4 outside.
Only white boys do this shit lmao
I still love my Remote Play...that why Sony make it.
or you can just buy a PS Vita...
this thing is portable like a fridge
The real name of this video: how to lose your social life
where do I find this backpack thing for ps 4
since when do nerds have muscles?
Austin Dont hit the camera tips and austin hide the mic thingy tips
wait, i can fit ENIAC in there? holy shit
owaow  that's amazing
It's going to over heat 😂
please sent me a ps4
*see through description *go to the link that directed to the stuff *see the price *close my laptop
Cool video mate!!
i am sure he is not going to pin this comment.
4:35 mom said go play outside
Hey nerd...       Can I have your portable ps4?
Are you Austin because of Gardenscapes?
How about "Building the Ultimate Portable Gaming PC With a 4k Monitor"?
just buy a Nintendo switch
Could this be a portable XBOX One too?
1:25 "Next we have the ps4 slem."
*earrapes* "HEY GUYS THIS IS AUSTIN."
and the internet nigga?
Xbox version
When your mom tells you to go outside
you look like the actor of beast in Xmen First Generation. Nice idea incredible.
dude you been to the gym? fucking shoulders big af
you are a genius👍
lol I got a ps4 ad
dude that looks awesome! i can play ps4 anywhere with that! great vid man!
4:21 huge distortion make you looking weird.
I want one for xbox one. Austin can you make a video on building a portable xbox one.
Consoles belong at home
ooo the Nintendo switch XL is out... FINALLY
Austin I really love your videos but can make video of ps3 kind of you
Steve Nash, life after the NBA
Can u try that on a plane
Best mobile ps4? Buy a vita, go to mcdonalds and use remote play.
I mean they did say to go outside
*Little Bits*
You didn't build anything you put a PS4 on that thing and made it portable
Smh. lowkey that was clickbait. you didnt build anything. disappointed you would stoop to that level Austin. Should have been called something along the lines of  "Setting up the Portable PS4"
just get a nintendo switch which is 720p in portable mode and have less to carry around and still have tons of great games and exclusives on there to play as well like the ps4.
Hahaha I sense a hint of sarcasm in this video.
Fuck a 500$ power unit and a 300$ portable case plus a 300$ ps4 slim 1100$ total nigga I'm broke as fuck I do love the video tho just saying it's pretty impressive but the price is painful
Mom: you need to gout out more  Me: *brings this everywhere
PlayStation Switch
Wow. Literally one of my classmates brought this to school today
This Is Pretty Bad Ass, But Wheres The Building?
portable my ass.This is just a paid ad for the vanguard case🤔
pls send me ps 4
The fuck is wrong with you
you didnt build anything
It's called a PS Vita
This should have been titled "Why Nintendo Made The Switch"
didn't really build it tho did ya
5:05 bla.. bla.. bla...
Aww, I thought you were gonna do something a little more extreme into the DIY spectrum... Oh well, still showing off something cool.
What I don't get is why would you need to bring your PS4 if there is a ps vita
takes up whole bench to be a loner on the go.
"I don't think the ps4 slim is compatible with these adjustable straps." -_-
Why not buy TWO batteries? When one goes out, charge it with the other one, then vice-versa. Unlimited power...for gaming.
So cool how to get that?amazone or eBay
This is a fricken big bulky thing. A Nintendo switch is way smaller and it can run 720p 60fps. No need for a fricken briefcase.
Hey guys this is Autism
Song was waaay to long.
The lamest thing Corden has done in the history of his show.  REALLY LAME!
How effing disrespectful to interrupt an interview with legends, Fonda and Tomlin, with a stupid - and really lame  - song and dance number.  Not good at all.
reminds me of family guy when they peter does a whole song and I stupid but funny one liner is behind the mystery door
wtf happened at the end... u can tell they don't know if he's half kidding or not kidding at all.
why can't James Corden be behind my door? I wouldn't even mind if it wasn't a mystery at all.
Maybe if it was like... 1st try! then they turn it down. 2nd try to convince them. They turn it down again. And then the 3rd time is the last. But the song is soo long.
The opening is SO LONG for the mystery door.
That was just dragging there was no need for all that
"I was just telling you about my SAG award" Lily cutie Tomlin
Two and a half minutes in and I have so many questions, none of which are "What's behind the mystery door?"
This was hilarious
Im glad James finally gets an opportunity to sing on this show ^^
Well, the whole song was a waste of my time...
I was getting sooo annoyed at how long that song was.......
What a great way to waste Jane Fondas and Lily Tomlins time.
Such a fucking douche
i keep watching this😃😃😄😂😂
Saw this coming from a mile away, still laughed when they went "ehm... nope". :D
I thought the song was gonna go on for the whole segment.
£10 says it's a oil painted nude portrait of James in the ocean
Any reason for James to do a song and dance number.
Because this is James Corden, I knew how this was going to end before it even started.
what a major gaffe - I can't imagine them doing this with major male icons as guests left high and dry while this high school production goes on and on and on and on. Really insulting and not remotely amusing.
Loved this bit so much!! LOL! Great song.
They didn't have a choice. That was how it was planned.
I love James Comedy lol
Who is the boy on the couch? Taylor?
Lily don't miss a beat still
I used to like James Cordon until I watched the way he handled the end of this interview.  Even if that was an act, he just successfully made himself look like a narcissistic jerk. Literal turn off.  Nice. 👌👎
All jokes aside, James is actually a decent actor
WHAT'S BEHIND THE MYSTERY DOOR??!?!??
Automatic dislike simply because of jane fonda. Goodnight bitch
It was pretty obvious what they would choose
🎶 Mystery Door! Mystery Door! What's behind the Mystery Door? 🎶
If Corden was acting that he was pissed, he's a good actor
Wait.. is this really it??
what's behind that mystery door could be dead could be alive what's behind that mystery door... all together now.   what's behind that mystery door 🚪
Really long song i did not care for it
Wtf James you have two absolute legends here and you don't even give them a proper interview?!
if the juggler dropped one of the throwing thing 😀😁😂
these women are dressed  like a rejected girl band lmao😂😂
Just any fucking excuse to sing lmao
Taylor Schilling drunk or high in this?
James stop trolling the Internet now. Go back to who u really are ;)
Carpool karaoke with little mix!!!
what the fuck is behind the mystery door!!!
when ever I see Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin I see them and Dolly Parton tying their boss to the chair in 9 to 5.
Hey james now all we want is a carpool kareoke with shawn mendes plz
71 like here
What was behind the mystery door? Seriously.
Thanks James now gonna have this song stuck in my head forever
This is my new go-to music and angry James is once again so cute!
how come I never see  BEYONCÈ on this show or any other
I still want to know what is behind the mystery door.

I swear, Saf could take makeup out of a dumpster and make it look flawless 😂
I want those fake lashes for so many things omg
OMG ALL THOSE THINGS WERE $1.50 EACH?!?! I GOTTA FIND MYSELF A DAISO
You honestly look good with anything you wear, those lashes are so pretty on you!! <3
the lashes look oddly good from afar
if you put makeup that doesn't really matches your skintone, but you also put it in your ears, it helps to make your face look even colored (i think) 💖 Hello from Mexicooo💘💘
i wish we had a daiso here.. :( they look so cuuuuute.
I got sidetracked by these fluffy mats 😂
The eyeshadow brush is for making a smudged eyeliner like eyeshadow ☺️
3:08 you're eyebrows are no where near as bushy as mine XD
i did not like the eyebrows, u needed an arch like ur normal shape
wow, I wish we had that store in Alaska! I'd be there all the time
your eyeliner looks good..  i cant ever get a cateye look aceptable and you did a better job han myself
I didn't notice until halfway through that you can see Tyler sitting down on his computer in the mirror 😂
1 week only with this make up pls 💕😂
How much did you spend in total?
I'm really sad now that there isn't a Daiso store near me in Florida. That place looks amazing to shop at. I would spend so much money
Love the lashes!  The sponges are the worst it irritates the skin too
What do I shamash if I've already shamashed the bell icon, the sub button, and the like?
This channel is growing soooooo fast
Those lashes were crazy! The look actually looked really good
She's getting over a mill on each vid omg!!!! shes def making more money now than at buzzfeed

YOU didnt think you nailed your eyeliner???!!! You should see me trying to attempt to do what you just did lol. Love you
iago look on point saf!
Safiya, you should try these DIY Yeezy heels for a video: http://www.seventeen.com/fashion/trends/news/a43310/socks-over-heels-diy/

The 100¥ store is my life... it was one of the first places that my friends took me to in Japan last year, probably going to happen this year too
The Lashes are looking really good on eyes actually. It gave a cute look to your face.
her ears are really red
I screamed when you finished lipstick "THE LASHES. THE BIRD LASHES. YOU NEED THE LASHES"
You can also get a lot of these for $1 on shop miss A! Everything on that website is seriously $1. There's an old haul video on my other channel (justurFAVs) shabajanak If you're curious lol
I love your beauty videos cos your just like a consumer and beauty lover, like us "normal people", not a "guru" or MUA teacher, which is more relatable and enjoyable to watch. I hope that makes sense!
This made me hungry
20 IN TRENDING!
You're rocking the signature Candace hairstyle!!
For anyone interested, you can buy all this stuff on certain e-bay stores and places that sell circle lens.  I know it's not exactly a dollar, but I will always love Diamond Lash 💅🏼
Is nobody gonna talk about how her eyes with the red eyeshadow remind me of josh Dun from twenty one pilots??
when I was younger I always bought makeup from the dollar tree. and to be honest they had some quality stuff
Please make a video where you try snacks from that store I's love to see it! Great video btw I love your content :) Lots of love from Portugal <3
But how did the product hold up throughout the day? did it stay on well?
The pony tail reminds me of Candice 😂
You should walk around like that 🙋🏻🌺
who else has never heard of Daiso
I LOVE YOU SM SAF
i think the eye makeup actually looks good lol
You have to tell us how this stuff lasts, otherwise the review is only half-useful. If it applies nicely, but melts down, creases, fades away in a couple of hours it's a bad makeup.
Basically a Japanese  Five Below. They both have similar items.
BLESS DAISO
do a food review of the snacks and stuff from their. my husband use to live in Japan and said he's never heard of it. but that was like 15 years.
I actually really love your videos and you were always my favorite from buzzfeed
I freaking loved Polly pockets when I was little!!
I actually have a femme lipstick but instead of gold it is pink.
Try the wish app please!x
she makes these products look so good, I really like the eyeshadow
CAMP GRANADA
now you can become donald trump!!
This looks so cute!!
You should do a video on the food and stuff!
Wth is going on at 3:23
She looks very pretty
That eyeshadow brush is really really good for the undereye line!
The lashes are kawaii ! :3
topshop clear "jeans" are something you should try for a week
I wonder if I have a daiso store nearby.
You should've done the feather eyebrows to help complete the sort of bird look
This is the first time I heard her swear
The eyeshadow was so pretty
there's a website i enjoy called shopmissa that has everything for a $1 and flat rate $3.95 shipping, they have cosmetics, jewelry and other random stuff lol. maybe try that!
how da fuq she makes the tacky makeup look so classy
I actually love the makeup video that you did 😍❤️

comments pliz
lol this is the same guy who made that donald trump, kim jong un and vladimir putin mask at Monsterpalooza 2017
These masks are mind-blowingly good.
wow pedos r gonna have a field day
Can he mask of me so I can wear it o.0
Really wished they'd used this kind of facial prosthetic or a variation there of to do Tarkin in Rogue One as opposed to the CGI mess we ended up with.
This guy could make billions in Porn
uncanny valley
Wtf is life
I'd buy the mask if I could.
I somehow think the Charlie sheen mask with that tiny strand of hair is creepier.
and that is how you get catfished
Great mask. Kids would love that for the giggles.
Make a red-headed one that looks like the Wendy's logo!
Hahahaha I'm really digging the Charlie Sheen in the background.
This is one of the best things ever made. Hahaha
This needs a seven foot man and a really girly gingham dress. Scary. As. Fuck.
This is UNBELIEVABLE! My jaw literally dropped. I would LOVE one of these for Halloween!
Please make this a mask for Payday 2!
You can even see Walter White in the background, now imagine waking up to that!
nightmares are made of this
Where's Pedo bear?
that smile!  I can't stop laughing.
That looks so real.
Looks like it would be perfect for a slasher movie
I just keep hearing Aphex Twin
That's amazing!
creepy AF .  lol
THAT WAS A MASK?!!!
wooooaahhhh
Almost getting an Aphex Twin vibe.  "Come to Daddy" flipped.
Those are so very impressive.
its so amazing!!
looks so real
Where can I buy this
What the actually FUCK is wrong with you thats creepy.I love it
I'm 6' 2" and 230lbs, I think I need to walk around the city at night wearing this.
That's freaky as hell
cant tell which side of the uncanny valley this would sit on!? well done!
daaammn!... Creepy as hell 😈
That is pure creative Nightmares!
That is so unbelievable!!!
Did I see Trump on the table?
I love the realism and did the guy say *"it smells like Bob"*
Wow, they look so real!
Wow that is do amazing.  The precision and realism is truly mind blowing.
I am so going to make one and walk around the city in this. I'll go live on my  social media once I have it finished. that'll be so funny
Yeah, that's creepy alright... urgh.
Where can I buy??
I love you! Do you remember my video about you? )
I wonder how many comments I've read on the internet that belong to people who are no longer alive.
your son loved you more than you know. coming from a recovering addict. you are a great mother. don't ever forget that.
Thank you for sharing your stories.
i have s6 edge and want to upgrade because i hate s6 due overheating I want to upgrade to s8 but afraid it's too overheating and thinking buy iphone7
The only thing I don't like about the S8 is the narrow screen, horrible idea Samsung. The note 8 will fix that so no problem.
What's that beautiful wallpaper with the orange color.  Main reason I click on this video
I love these commercials!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12 megapixels 
Will it explode after three weeks?
Who is waiting for Note 8? :D
nice in depth review especially ergonomics, i was very curious on that subject.
The phone looks amazing but I think Samsung slacked on the camera. The pictures look amazing but video seems a bit grainy in low light and not buttery smooth. I think the Galaxy S7 video was better.
Thanks Jaime, always looking for your reviews!
Whats the deal with the app icons with the white background?
I love the second question hahaha!
Great review! Galaxy S8 plus after using it a week has been fantastic! spot on video :)
I'm Jaime Rivera and you're watching Disnney Channel
So, for a few exceptions it's the best phone EVA! Just like every phone out there!? Good job selling out to Samsung. Your cadence is seriously obnoxious.
why do you put that hideous calendar in the middle of the screen it looks horrible!
I call the ip8 to copy the infinity display
925 .00 with taxs r u kidding r tripping
3d touch on the samsung 8 .?
Shut up and take my money, samsung!
Give it 3 updates and the battery life will be shit. such a large phone and almost the same battery size as my note 4. if they can fit a 4K battery in the s7 active you'd think they could fit a 4.5K in the larger body.
Looks better than the S7 but it is not better than the S7
So Google....we want this hardware and your amazing software. Go.
I prebooked s8+ can't wait to get my hands on
Ever since nougat 7.1.1 my axon 7 has gotten hotter than ever, and by that i mean it gets hot quickly, like 42deg celcius... not hot, just gets hot quikly
I love the new dbrand skin
"I'm Blindmaine Rivera... and this is 90's glasses now"
Yes there is 10h + screen on time phone, it is called galaxy a9 5000mAh baterry, now 9:26 hours with 26% baterry left with intense use
Bixby is a really interesting experience.
great video, would love to win the LG so I could compare myself, big fan.
traveler grab peace self sudden seat sexually easy temperature.
2 weeks to late. Everyone already bought it.
how's​ the battery vs the op3t
game name please?
Samsung Galaxy Still better then Apple Garbage.
I would so get this but I'm waiting for the Note 8 or whatever it's called lol can't wait to go back to Samsung and ditch my iPhone lol although I will miss iMessage 😢 but oh well . .
That homescreen is just terrible Jaime Rivera, Jaime Rivera, Jaime Rivera, Jaime Rivera...
What's the ONE thing you hear when a galaxy phone gets reviewed year after year? LAG LAG LAG!!!!!
The exploding phone jokes are beyond old now! Get over it already.
Excellent review as aways, Jaime! Very informative and well filmed scenes. Keep up with the great work!
Galaxy s8: good phone with a nice design and rather minor tweaks and additions over the previous version. Meh.. OnePlus 5 for me this year if they put a bigger battery in
Idk why but this guy comes across as an asshole to me
what if the Note 7 exploding was staged?
Anyone else waiting for the OnePlus 5?
Yep, got an s8 regular at launch and have loved it.  While people keep saying the battery is small, compared to my Galaxy S6, this phone lasts forever for me based on my use.
that's like saying does your Iphone bend
where is my 4K quiltiy?
after I saw the note 8 trailer I don't know if I'll buy the S8
how do you spell this dudes name. hi-mere-de-weather.
Stutter? Are you nuts? Nobody falls for that anymore, iPhone's iOS-hardware integration vs Samsungs lagging software ... lol ... Apple is grasping for straws ...
jaime what theme do you use for the iris scanner? thanks!!
I have S6 non-edge and really dislike any edge variants, doubt I'll ever opt for one. Even regular S7 haves edge curve on back. Tried S8 in store too.
nice video review I am very happy with my Galaxy S8!!!!!!!
i got this phone first day, and all of the iphone plebs at my high school didnt give a shit.
Hahaha you look so stoned at 7:28
great review!
*CORRECTION* 12 MP CAMERA
Is that a Galaxy S8+ in your pocket? Or are you just happy to see me.
watching this on my s8. sorry Samsung but I will always prefer stock over skin. I just defaulted to Nova launcher anyways
but is it better than the NOte 7 LOL
watching on my s8😀
in the past, all my androids lagged.. now with the s8+, I can say I experienced no lag at all. smoothest experience! so happy with my purchase.  sold my iPhone 6s to get the s8+
I should stop watching reviews ... I can't effort this :(
Wait..... That game.... Wasn't it for PlayStation like 10 years ago or so?  Plz tell me the name of the game 😭😭😭
Can't wait to buy this in 3 years when I can afford it :)))
Jaime please i need help, google pixel or galaxy s8? i trust you.
Will this be the year i get off a Note 3? im tempted with a S8+ but holding off for a possible Note 8.
You can really extend the battery on the S8 by revealing Developer Options and disabling background processes and checking the option of closing each app after you've backed out of it. standby time greatly increased.
Should I get arctic silver or the black?
are some of those pictures in Lisbon ?!
You guys have such great production on your videos. Great work as always!
I don't know why an listening to this channel
Those fotos are from Portugal!!!
They should have opted for 6gb of ram at least for the plus variant, 7.1 will only do so much.
works with glasses I don't think it's sucure
12mp not 13
looks nice but lag has turned me away
Oh, just give me the iPhone 8 now
Should I buy it? Coming from a s6
I love how people bash the OnePlus 3T for being 1080p and then never take the S8 out of FHD 😂
I'd buy it if the fuckin' skin wasn't all up in your face. Seriously, there is such a thing as overdoing it in terms of features.
Jaime I got the s6 edge was it a good buy? cost me $399.99
can you do z review of the Samsung Level On pro headphones? I can see you wearing it every time
Just another junky android phone!
How long till the t mobile version will get 7.1 update? Other than a few minor things I love my s8
As always... great review. you touched on some very important aspects of the S8. Keep up the great work.
Lets just say this guy is the best in smartphone reviews... The end
beauty and the beast.
A phone that looks like that and running pure android
The software on this phones going to become irrelevant in a year or so. Samsung never stays up to date on Android
How zombie land should have ended?
Or why not invest time and money into making original live action Disney movies? They hit it out of the ballpark with Enchanted, keep doing it!
it's nice to see an inversion on the old 5 stages formula by having the guy go through the stages this time.
can you make "how 13 reasons why should have ended"
I blame Once Upon A Time for inspiring them lol
why the hate on hunchback of notre dame? it was a really great movie
Marvel fan watching Disney, now she can say Avengers is Disney :(
Plz do "Moana", also plz, make an ending when we see her sailing on the see with lsd near by her x) and put the message "Don't do drugs"
My THREE stages of watching a Disney remake:  1. PREVIEW - See the trailer on TV. 2. UNPLUG - Turn OFF the damn TV. 3. GO OUTSIDE - ...............Um. Yeah, go outside and do something productive.
"The black cauldron!" "Oh they are remaking that! Google it!" "Oh! ..... Oh."
This is my first of this series. Is it supposed to be black screen?
Disney is just doing what they want to do: make new projects, not a remakes. You are blind if you think they are bad.
That girl is literally saying what i was thinking through every remake ever!
Beauty and the Beast live action was great... on par with the original, if not better.
Do guardians of the galaxy vol 2!!!!
Hurts Doesnt It lmao
Hey Hishe can you do a different ending with boxtrolls
can you make Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2 ? please
Disney will always be awesome and don't forget it!!!!
Am I the only one who thinks I have seen this before?
"Why remake this?" you ask? Easy answer: *_$$$$_*
So... They became friends?
I don't think this applies to the jungle book
in next episode do guardians of the galaxy vol.2 how it should have end
Hush, love. The original is always there for us.
You should bring back the few videos you guys made of optumis and megatron kinda like batman and superman.
These guys should do how lion king should have ended or kong skull island
Exactly what is racist about the Aristocats? Do you PC junkies have to just look for racism in everything so you can feel good about yourselves? (Yes you do, it's self righteousness, not bc you actually care).
This was SO ME , watching B&B ROFL
I force myself to think its a whole different film and not a remake but it never fully works :/
In Gaurdians of the Galaxy vol.2  SPOILER ALERT Star Lord shoul have worn his mask the same one that saved Gamora, and gave his  ``Daddy" the  space armor instead of him
Disney movies suck. Pixar is the only thing that holds Disney up.
Adult disney uber fans are weird. Its like adult harry potter uber fans. That being said not every movie needs a live action adaptation.
Just replace Disney with Ghost in the Shell and this is me.
UugggghhhAristocats didn't have any rasism
awww, I really liked beauty and the beast ^_^
i mean to be fair they did whay he described with that jungle book. remake was way better than the animated version
but...but I liked Beauty and the Beast. and Cinderella. and Maleficent.    LEAVE BELLE'S DRESS ALONE *cries*
Disney needs a remake.
How it should have ended 13 reasons why
How it should have ended moana
Can you make Judy Hopps in Raiders of the Lost Ark?
Please do how Passenger should have ended lol
I was so bored at the B&b movie. We got to the Mob song and I was like, is it over yet?
make hero swap the dark knight with deadpool
Where's the lego Batman movie HISHE?
make hishe watchmen
I actually can't wait for the lion king to come to life, finger crossed if Beyoncé plays Nala
Do how assassin's creed the movie should have ended
power rangers should have ended
"It´s all of them isn´t it"
If they really are planning to remake every old Disney cartoon, they have no excuse not to do Treasure Planet (here's hoping they don't destroy he beauty of the original)
I'm in your school I'm Eric
some things should be left alone
How Guardians of the galaxy Vol.2 should have ended
There's nothing wrong with the Black Cauldron! :/
Funny, I said all of them to myself right before they said it xD
can you guys please do "How Ringu Should Have Ended" or "How The Ring Should Have Ended" i just wanna see one of the rings get a HISHE, cause i think that they can be made really funny.
They'll all be remade provided there's an audience for it. Show no interest and it won't be remade. In any case, if they remade Back to The Future I will always love the originals.
I'd definitely watch the Black Cauldron one, great animation but other than that the original was so underwhelming there's no where to go but up.
Please do 5 stages of watching 13 reasons why! Its such a good series!
So is OnlyLeigh like working for you guys now or something?
hi long time fan so please can you do ratchet and clank hishe please it would make my day if your already making one do that then do rac please
They should remake Star Wars episode VII...
aristocats is my favorite disney movie though :(
can you guys do lord of ring how sould be ended again
the posters in the backround are pretty amazing
how trolls or the secret life of pets should ended
hurts, doesn't it?
Shrek is the greatest movie of all time. I have a shrine for it in my house and I pray to my lord Shrek every day
I'll stop complaining if they remake some of their less successful but still really good films like Atlantis or Treasure Planet cuz that'll give these great films another chance.
dont tell me Disney  at 2025 youll remake the emperor's new groove the actor will be cringey i tell you...CRINGEY!!!
The only one what wow'ed me with it's awesomeness was juNGLE book, everything else is either crap or meh
*shrugs* I actually really liked the Beauty and the Beast remake.
You used soundtrack from "Modern Times"? Charlie Chaplin.
"What's so great about Disney anyway...I did like Shrek" Sorry, but I don't think a person who can't think of a single Disney movie actually exists.
Am I the only one who thoroughly enjoyed the Beauty and The Beast remake?
This was 100% me watching Beauty and the Beast!!!
Yes, they are going to re make every single one, aren't they...... Disappointment Disney, disappointment is all I can give you.
They are remaking the black cauldron!? please Oh dear god who is in heaven please let them remove that annyoing I dont even know what it was creature!
How john wick chapter 2 should have ended
Are you doing Guardians of the galaxy 2 HISHE
can you be pleass do a comparison for la prarie caviar foundation $274 vs ALDI caviar foundation $19.99. they appear to look like dupes
Hi chloe! could you test out the Sisley PHYTO-TEINT ECLAT foundation? Thank you!
you dont need false lashes at all.... your lashes are so beautiful naturally😍😍😍
girl whats on your lips!!!
Love ur hair like this!
Ugh I really wanted these to work.
need a tutorial for her makeup here!
Appreciate the honesty Chloe :))
What about cutting the magnet strip off the lashes and stick it on to better fake lashes do that they are magnetic? 😂
Aw thanks for buying it. I definitely appreciate it. Glad you could show us this. 💕
Hi Chloe, what lip product are you wearing in this video?
You are so beautiful, Chloe!
"if you can't be fucked" is my new favorite saying.
This reminds me of magnetic earrings you used to have when ur a kid 😂😂but these are better obvs ahaha
all the need is a small magnet either end of the strip to stop the edges flicking off
Chloe please try 37 activities foundation!
It's kind of insulting how little that brand apparently values quality. The idea is innovative but it's like they didn't think for a second about whether it actually works, looks and how practical it is.
Wtf.... that's the shittiest beauty innovation"" for 69$ e v e r.
What if something metal gets pulled towards your eyeball like some final destination shit
BOXED BROWS (especially inner, near nose) aren't done anymore. AND THEY AGE YOU! 🤔 A thick solid band isn't done A N Y M O R E 🤔😳🙄
the accents look SOOOO good imo
do a tutorial on the makeup ur wearing in this video plz gooorgeous
$69usd is like nearly $90aud no thank you!!
But they didn't  slip away????????
Chloe can you do a tutorial using the Natasha Denona palette!!!!
Loved this! It's so interesting... May 1st was my birthday and I loved watching your video on my birthday❤
Why did they not think about making the band curved? Huge fail design wise. $69?!?! FM that's expensive for a shitty product.
chloe would you do an updated brow routine?! would love it thanks xo
Hi, Chloe. What blush/color are you wearing? Looks extremely pretty. Thanks!
Yooo $200 for three sets of shit lashes omg
could you do a peachy golden  bronze  prom look as prom out here is approaching
Holyyy shit $206.95 🤢🤢 That's $206 more than they're worth. That's crazy! I love how real your reviews are!
Idk about lash extensions tho, everyone who gets them ends up bald on they lash line like no think yeww✌🏽✌🏽
what lip combo is this??? its gorgggg
patent the dot magnet idea, don't give it to them
What about magnetic eyeliner with matching lashes to stick onto the eyeliner? That might be cool
thanks for doing this video and avoiding your followers from buying them!
hahahha! this is what I callk .. real life & honest review :)LUV that!! THANKS
Damn for that price I could just make my own at home.  Get some cheap eyelashes and then glue tiny magnets on them.
Great, honest review! Thanks Chloe😊
Y'all freaking out about her paying $200. This is her job. It's a business expense. She can write it off on her taxes. Relax folks. Besides, it's her damn money. She can do what she wants with it.
ive just noticed i never get my eyes off your skin LOL made me laugh so hard. its so clear and youthfull i'm dying
I would be so nervous that they would fall off during the day
Lool I would be so mad that I bought something like this... Hopefully you'll find some sort of use out of them!!
I'd be afraid that somehow the magnet would come off and go into my eye
I hope you returned them.
Yes girl! Loving these frequent uploads! <3
"They might be good for people who aren't good at lashes" THE SHADE! 🤣🤣 I'm not good at lashes and I ain't mad 💃🏾
You would think they would have thought to put two small magnets on each end in order for it to look like they're not falling off....
Please do a Q&A soon!! It's been a long time! :'(
Can't you return them?
Is it safe to have magnets near your eyes for long periods of time almost every day?
check my work on insta @makeupbyalyazia   !!
That blush looks amazing Chloe!
''Tis a lot of money!..can you return them? Can you let us know? I bought individual lashes from local drugstore, CVS-the glue didn't work, got store credit. Thanks for the interesting video 😘
Love your rings! Where can I get them/something similar? xx
i love your make up and your hair! you look so pretty please do tutorial.
But why would they only put a magnet in the centre of the lash? Huge design flaw. When you glue false lashes everyone knows the glue at the inner and outer corner is the most vital!
aww and its so expensive too!
I hope they let you return them
I bought these several months ago and I actually like them. With a little practice you can't even tell you have them on.
you look so goood sweety 💋
what happened to your extensions
How weird!! Thanks for trying them out, such an interesting concept
I think they're a good idea but they need to be improved in alot of areas
I wonder if the magnetic thing is "dangerous" for your eyes? Can it hurt your eyes or am I just too dramatic or something?
I know this has nothing to do with the video but ever since I've found your channel, I've become obsessed with your body haha ❤ could you do a workout routine video?  Unless you have already!
This seems like a semi good idea but was just really poorly executed
Your eyes look *really* small in this video.
They remind me of dolls' eyelashes 😂
They should have been curved at the band so they could fit without having the sharp edge
It's a great idea, but it hasn't turned out too good. Definitely needs some work
I'm very confused as to why they put the magnet in the middle...wouldn't it have been better the put a smaller magnet on both of the ends of the lashes? To stick the edges down properly???
lol Chloe you are such a good sport. that is a horrible product though! lol  xoxomarilynn beauty4ever 😙
you known free gift card pls see #paypcodes
Hehe, I loved listening to you work through improvements. I'm forever trying to modify crap products I've spent money on 😂
Oml like if her voice sounded soooo American in the beginning of the video xD
I saw these on instagram and I thought I was soo cool and I wanted them but not anymore
Wunderbrow please!
What blush are you wearing x
I think I will stick to good old falsies because I deff can be fucked when it comes to fleeky lashes 😩
Can't believe anyone at any point thought these would be a good idea... and then went through entire production phases and still didn't see the glaring flaws.
At the end she said she got them a couple a days ago but at the start she said she got them the night before
how much cost for these lashes ?
how the fuck do they have so many positive reviews on their website???🤔🤔🤔
Chloe I wonder if these could be DIY'd! You could use some falsies that you already like and attach some small magnets?
spent the whole video looking down
I think it might work better if you started with the bottom lash and held it there while putting the one on top after
some people are allergic to eyelashes glue, this might be an option for them. But the company definitely should get a simpler package and invest that money to get a better quality eyelashes
My coworker and I were wondering about these. Thank you for saving us the trouble lol 😘 love your videos you crack me up every time I watch them
I understood a whopping 1% of the video.
Budget build? Because everyone casually has $1000 to spend on an all right pc.
You should realize these builds can mislead people who dont know any better. Dont sell yourself out to sponsors.
intel i5 lineup is dead in the water overpice junk vs amd r5 no overclocking no upgrade path that makes sens in year or two
$1000. Has an i5 7500. This is terrible.
So can you use 3000mhz xmp memory with b150 or h170 chipset with it's xmp rated speed?
worst build guide ever
Ryzen just comes out and you do a video with an intel processor smh
I'm not going to be quiet, this shit is embarrassing!! This is a Pay-Per-View Video!!
kek an i5, disliked, closed video
wait, why tf am I watching this? Am not a peasant
nah, need 3x that budget.
Maybe he made a shit $1000 build for people to comment on it and warn others. IDK
its amd, I'm out
if i would have money i would build this
The flame thrower was the best investment LMG could have ever made.
A LOCKED i5 ON A $1,000 GAMING COMPUTER? I think linus should listen to his power supply and Be Quiet!
Anytime you build a pc with only one gpu, go mini itx.
for me as a regular viewer this video is different in small approach details and I like it a lot! Nice refreshment brahs
this is a 1k build without even a gtx 1060, 1070 or even 1080 ? Overpriced sponsored products ? This video is  Buuuuuuuuuullllllllllllllllshiiiiiieeeeeetttt!
Why not a Titan Xp
wow, worst budget build of 1017...
Spend money on case, heatsink and then get an rx480 makes sense.
0:40 Song name? Please xD.
Lol makes a budget build but spends 100 on case lol. I would rather spend that on something else.
you are an awesome guy linus the amount of effort you put in the videos clearly describes about your talent and leadership qualities keep up the work
Do you know what I don't have pc or if I will buy one it would be prebuilt
6k dislike, I like it.
could i ad a tb hard drive,  if so how and which one can i use?
This is the worst value for money ever.
I think you should test this 4.595 dollar graphics accelerator!  https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAA4T4U60753&cm_re=NVIDIA_Tesla-_-9SIAA4T4U60753-_-Product
I LOVE BUILD GUIDES
an i5 7500 in stead of r5 1600 this is a stupid build foh.
Is it just me or was Paul's comment censored? Cuase I can't see it anymore...
damn... this whole pewdipie thing with all the companies not buying ads on YT anymore, seems to really fuck up youtubers... hope this sponsord video is worth the dislikes.
shame on you linus . all of the viewers should dislike the video so that linus knows that people hate fucking paid guides which is not good
Don't trust a 'budget' build guide if it is sponsored...... This is so much better - https://pcpartpicker.com/list/cRmknn
i liked you better when you were in a garage
0:21 hahah thats me xD  Nice joke
Can you do a guide for a $2.6k build this rig is too weak for me
@0:27 Freaked me out more than it should have.
if you go with a blue drive but you want more than 1TB, youll be going from 7200 RPM's to 5400 RPM's...
rip in pieces Ryzen
lol what a build...at least you have an SSD though
FANtastic price
Two questions: Any reason that it wasn't an AMD CPU? What should I go for were I to be more interested in a quite than flashy PC? I.E. Glass panel and RGB lighting is a tad bit too flashy for me! :p
Idc if I know how to put a cpu in a socket. But stuff like that is really therapeutic to watch
fixed the motherboard issue   https://pcpartpicker.com/user/crowneddanny/saved/xgkrHx
Linus your videos are great but the sponsors make them shit.
Glad to see that nice camera getting ruined by the horrible colour grading LTT is known for.
I have not problem with sponsored videos but this is too much...
FINALLY, i have a use for all that drug money i have been saving.
load of shite
No one understood the satirical delivery of this entire video....
You failed. Hard.  You should have used the UEFI: Kingston [...] here, rather than booting into legacy mode.  Congrats on needing to reinstalling the OS to get UEFI mode.
13:26    He didn't say PSU shield!! oh, wait...
Linus, lately I can feel there is a disturbance in the force. Don't yield to the dark side. Stay true to the path and you'll never be a stranger.  Sincerely.  :)
As good as the explanation is this is so dishonest!. Major dislike 😡!.
Do a build on the best gaming build for 2017
when the shitty sponsor part in every video is not enough because you burned so much cash on recording 8k. sell out bois
U forgot the optical drive.
Damn thats a lot of "then". XD
i got 100$ extra on me... 900 more to go
Wearing antistat strap on top of socks, great Linus.
changing the thumbnail continuously
this is not money well spent
Linus, big fan for 3 years now, but come on. This build makes no sense at all. In reference to 13:16 you could say that your comment section is flaming you rn. Love your vids man, but come on. I expected better
A mobo with no hdmi or displayport? In a $1000 build?!
Don't forget to add the cost of Windows. I don't understand why everyone leaves this off.
Be Quiet should Be Quiet about what parts they have you pick on a non overclocking chip.
wow, video is in 4k but the text looks pixelated af
how about a 1k editing computer.
yeah, this isnt a good budget build. You could get away with a title such as "poser gaming pc" but not "budget". Budget is all about VFM, and this has none.
i'll never buy an AMD card again.
"..next, you'll need to screw on THIS piece, holding it in place from the front while  screwing it in from the back..." Oh! Linus....
Na Mannnn..././.... CAse is nOt Looking Goood. :(  Really Weak and Dull... Honestly Not Going to Use That,.. :/
Anyone else notice that Linus's videos have been washed out lately? The videos are super white. Are they using a different codec?
Just let LTT upload these sponsor videos once in a while and don't care about them. They deserve the money. I mean at least this build is quiet O.O
This has genuinely given me a decent idea on what to use for my little brothers rig, thanks guys!
you should do worth it hibachi
"Do you like the owls?" "Yeah." I love him so much omg
So they had to share the 40 dollar cocktail but each got the 208 dollar one?
FUK! I WANT TO GO TO RICH PLACE
Are they gay? i have been always wondering
I don't usually drink .. but when I do
cash black is like a Fallout New Vegas character
No one is talking about how a $6 drink during happy hour is not a low price point lol
I'm still caught up on the "deionised water"...
What a great opportunity for Adam to get introduced to the alcohol world all i want to say ENJOY
Let's all take note that everyone drinking is not driving. Can y'all see that? make a note. Mmk thx
dam taht macallan outpost has a shelf of alcohol that is wort more than even some sports cars
Adam is my spirit animal.
Gin, tonic, AND lime juice. Citrus prevented scurvy, and British sailors kept citrus trees on their ship, hence the term "Limeys"
Cocktail,, from the old French "coquetelle", meaning a mixed-up concoction
Was anyone else hoping to see a drunk Adam at the end of the video? I imagine him being super talkative and crazy...
I really enjoyed listening to the last bartender's voice
Wtf, is being a hot guy a requirement for bartenders? Are they ALL sexy men? I think I need to visit more bars...
What was the music at the last cocktail test? I am really digging it.
To all y'all bitches saying, "Finally, no gold/caviar/truffles!".....did you not see the cheesecake video?
cash black looks like the type of guy who would pick wallets of their wasted customers lol
These videos get me through the day
2:58, they picked the wrong music for that moment
can we get more of cash black  lol
there's a highland park in pittsburgh near the zoo.
all them leaving buzzfeed vids. well at least we all know who and what is not leaving buzzfeed.
im a bartender... this is great...
Who doesn't like the fact that Steven didn't drive?
highland park 30 is what? 600 dollars? good ivestment if youre selling 200 dollar drinks from it...
Cash Black looks like a faint cross between Miles Teller and Ryan Reynolds.
try the most expensive dumplings and dimsum guys!!
$5 blowjob vs $5000 blowjob
Adam is my favorite part of all of these videos, just saying lol
Food is better
there's a special round in hell for people who mix a fine single malt
3 days ago... christ almighty ______O
Finally! Someone else with my name
The last one looked amazing I'd definitely try it just for the experience. Partners birthday or special occasions I think it would be a great night!
That bartender was lit AF 🔥🔥
the cameraman is gay? and i think the chinese guy flirts with everyone. he may not be fruity, but he definitely like watermelon.
I use the tonic to improve the taste of the gin...
Who else was expecting truffles, gold, or caviar to be in these drinks?
mark doust is a hottie! 🔥
adam is my spirit animal
"i think this is my worth it winner" next moment "i cant belive that i am saying this, 10 pounds is my worthy winner" like, BRUH???
hi i'm cent grey. cash black is my uncle
what is the headphone adam is using?
why would i pay 208,- dollars for a cocktail if it doenst even have a little umbrella?
i love when adam smile after eat/drink good stuff 😳😳😳
10:03 look at the bartender in the corner
I love Adam he is so cute 😃 he makes this series even more fun to watch
steven gets more and more crazy throughtout the vid...
Cash Black is the man!!
You should do $ Lobster vs $$$ Lobster
Give Adam a microphone so we can hear him.
Who is the driver?
im waiting for the moment they actually dislike the food
When Andrew dropped the coffee all I could think about was that episode of try guys were they had to survive in the sea and Eugene cut the boat open when they were near a SHARK
go to gordom ramsay restaurant...
WHAT WAS THE COCKTAIL FACT
Do coffee or host chocolate next
OMG！Adam is soooooooooooooo cute!!!!
1$ fries vs 1000$ fries!
buzzfeed, can you give me 500 dollars?
I've only seen that ice ball on Bungo stray dogs lol
Please do Udon or Ramen!! :D
"Who would've known that when you eat different foods,  things taste different in your mouth" great insight lolol
Super professional bartender mispronounces "Deionized" but whatever
love love LOVE this trio. they have the best chemistry!!
you took my advice and did a cocktail :)
whose here from Vegas?
Do you like the owls?  Adam: yeah  Me: *dies because he is so adorable*
I have a feeling that Steven is gonna go to a strip club
Do grilled cheese
Do different flight classes worth it video
Oh yay fun, I love these episodes <3
_I was expecting a gold cocktail topped with cavier and truffles in this episode_  _Finally! An episode without those stuff._
have they done ice cream?
Adams the best part
$16 wine Vs $1390 wine
You can tell how annoyed he is by him the entire time
Oh goodie! New stuff to make ADC's hate their life even more! Just my favorite! *Internally crying*
What have you guys at Rito done with our all mighty Tons Of Damage LORD?
WOAH PLZ DONT PUT THE CC ABOVE THE NAMES
I'm so disappointed in zac's update
when are you fixing death recap ? it's been useless since s1
That feeling when league makes heroes of the storm before people realize what heroes of the storm is
Updating the game doesn't necessarily = better especially in riots case
Real important info: the Rift Herald dances when you destroy the enemy nexus with her nearby
i want my Phreak back!!!!...hes voice way more cooler and tons of damage.
LOL @ 2:38 , nice one Rito xD
K , what about Nunu then?! he needed that more than your 3 lovely champions
What does the word 'proc' mean? 5:00
I'm a DOTA 2 player and I enjoy these LoL videos.
When the update comes out, people will just go attack the new Rift Herald after more than 10 minutes and they'll be like a whole gank party fight there.
"improving"
who da faq buffs maokai when he's already the unkillable tank
dafaq, tank meta is still here and they get buffs? everyone just play 5 man tanks... cus if you can't die, you auto win...
so, nobody is going to talk about how adaptive helm is going to break one for all?
Did you rly forget to show sejuani ult
finally 10 bans for ranks  :DDD no more cancerous champs in my solo duo !
give me my old launcher!
Groot and zac are brothers. CONFIRMED.
wtf 10 bans
Okay so  basically more copy pasta from WoW now Herald is charging like Icehowl from Trial of the Grand Crusader instance. GG on imagination
how can install new beta client?
adcs have become useledd
10 ban lol, bye bye yasuo and zed, see you in the refund section.
update the kit of naut too please.
Constantly improving league dont talk shit bring back the old client cause the new one sucks and is full of bugs
Well thank you LoL for making Jinx she made me try this game out. THANK YOU JINX
Why did you put the timer of the spells (stuns,silence and the others)...
Constantly improving = breaking the game
how can i make or join to group chat like "aram" or "ip" in new. client
For this Mid-season we felt our biggest improvement would be updating the time spent for bot lane in the grey screen simulator.
PENTAKILL ALBUM WHEN?
PENTAKILL ALBUM WHEN?
A slow the width of a lane LMAO
When can the mastery system be updated?
this may be a noob question but how do you claim the reward for the quest on spell thief's edge? D: cant seem to claim it besides buying frostfang
your talon update was a joke.
Excited for the rift herald, push with it and yorick ult :D
Some things I would really want to see are 1) Executioners building into more than one item 2) QSS building into an AP item for mages
I think these are good changes :/
10 bans? Rito has ears guys...rito has ears...;v;
smite is better
the new rift herald is absurd and the fact they want to spell out debuffs to people is a joke. nothing but a tool to help shit low elo players.
10 ban system?  HOLY FUCK CAUSE CHAMP SELECTION DIDNT TAKE LONG ENOUGH ALREADY
Easily the best thing here was the pitch increase to Zac's voice as he gets smaller.
New urf maokai gonna be crazy
loooove the rift herald thing omg!!
This voice actor is awesome!
the extra text is a bad idea
when i first seen that zac spotlight before this video i thought it was fake... Damn.
who is this clown talking
Can't tell if phreak is sick or replaced
When rifty OPMs your turret seconds before you get back to lane. Fun times ahead.         Before your jimmies get rustled, yes i read the notes. Im just saying, its gonna happen.
this isnt enough riot, we need a 50 champion ban system....
SUCH A STUPID UPDATE!!!! STOP IT RIOT
What if morde kills new rift herald?
seems like bullshit
what's the song? 0:22
JUST when we thought that maybe Rito would stop fucking ADCs and buffing tanks... they do it again
what is the song?
"Improving." ok stop right there I can't take it anymore rito 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
Rift herald is  op
Please tell me that Rift herald still will have that easter egg of if you dance she dances. I love to do that when im jungle and waiting for camps to respawn
how boring sigh
0:09 ''improving league''  ha. haha. hahahahahahha. hahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAA
WHERE'S FREAK????
Make mordekaiser great again
pls rework urgot, he is fun to play but he is too slow for how he is squishy. that make him a too easy target and he doesnt even have good cc.
How do people feel about the new Maokai? It seems like the old ulti kept him alive for a good time but with this new ulti, he doesn´t seem that tanky anymore
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASS
New Rift Herald and Ziggs together in one lane,gg wp.
Free ma boi Tyler1
Why does it just not feel the same without Phreak voicing it? :(
lol Zac's new Q. It is like when you tell a boy and a girl to look at each other then pushing their heads together. Also now I know who the hell exhausted me.
Tanky DPS has always, ALWAYS been the meta. Anyone who says otherwise is full of shit. Do more damage and get more HP? That's the core point of any build.
8 trend in Japan!
Youre in the trends in Germany russia and other countrys how much money you Spend?
What is the name of the song? So chill
Why is this in the german Trends?
#4 Trends in Germany !?
I have a friend in Texas and I can´t contact him for some reason so I´d appreciate it a lot if somebody could tell me the names of the deads.... I am really worried
i'm in georgia. weather is making its way here😬🤙🏼 prayers for all injured and impacted by this storm
I was 3 miles away in gun barrel city
End Times everyone and Nuclear War is next to come.
That was just the beginning of the SECOND? How many tornadoes were in that area?
Nice shooting, Tex!!!
It looks like the guy is in the direct path of the storm. Probably didn't think it would get so big. I am glad the video made it and Sam Dienst recovered it. Sub'd.
this happened yesterday.... he said Holy shit 😂😂
good video Sam....watched this soon as you posted it on Youtube....BTW  this was the first video posted on Youtube from the canton tornado  on 4-29-17....good job and thanks for having it posted so fast!!!!
Dude... You were in the Bears Cage with that video.  Entirely too close.  Epic footage, but it'd be better to be alive than having someone post it posthumously for you.
dude I hope u are safe I was in van
Dang that was intense stuff!
wow. great video.
dude my wife made us stop for sweet tea 3 exits down the burger king receipt says 6:58 reports say the one that hit the freeway was at 7:04  when we drove past the emergency crews were not even there yet .
You've gotta be kidding me. Those trees looked like ROCKETS!
Spectacular footage!
Yeah, I live in liberty city, I'm praying for people in canton! :,(
way to close bro
i was in this tornado area💦
Omg!!! I just got word of the Canton TX tornado I hope no one was injured!
did you take this video? if so, may we use it across our nbcu partners and platforms?
Cool video, hope nobody was hurt or killed in this storm.
Where was this at in canton
just followed you....never heard of ya. stay safe!
is everything ok...ended a bit shocked........?  hope n pray ur safe..
how is eveything out there is it over
1:00 i'm pretty sure there were holes on the side of the gadget on the other half of the gadget that you could use for the big plug
Definitely love the last one when wires are plugged into the wall.
Putin to the test
Who knows what else we put in there
The kitchen one is pretty useless, babies are smarter than you may realize.
I think he will be crazy russian father
That looked so sore when he was banging his palm on that corner lol
Welcome To America

#CrazyRussianFather
Is someone hinting at a crazyrussian J.R <3 <3
Protects from the babies - Taras 2017 😂
the tolet one is also good for dogs
i think he is hinting something..........
1:57 how are u gunna plug things in?
These gadgets would no doubt be useful with pretty much any kind of youngster, be it Babies, Kittens or Puppies.
the curtain cord should be higher and some of these are good if you have a disabled child or adult or a dog as well.
3:04 definitely PUTIN it on my tables
you have kids?
5:05 what happens if your a kid and you need to pee?
rare footage of Russian man making a bomb
4:20 yeah, just to get it off you grab a butter knife and just stick it under...
I have a feeling he forgot his safety one night, and now that video....

He's gonna be a safety dad
soo many precautions, your house will soon feel like prison.. :)!
This was on TV right this minute
10 babies to put to the test...😂😂😂
I feel like I'd be afraid that the babies could get their fingers trapped underneath the toilet seat cover
Wouldn't it just be easier to use a command hook for the blinds? Lol
Taras, are y'all trying to tell us something?? 👶😊
Today I will be "Putin" to the test
the first gadets maybe the holes at the buttom ar for the bud plugs
Aren't those for toddlers?
i dare this guy to sing pain 3 days grace
???? Your bird egged up... that would be the only thing that explains this vid...
Liked before i even watched the video. Who's with me?
You should react to vitas 7th element
I think he is secretly trying to tell us something without making it too obvious 😉😊
wheres the boom counter
Babys love to put their fingers inside things....... wow
count how many times he says boom
The first gadget can be used as a cable management sort of thing for gaming setups.
Ayyyye you trying to tell us something??? 😆😆😆
6:17 why would kids even try to babyproof something they would be the one trying to play with it
These  gadget are good for him
Awesome all of it
0.12 puttin😂😂
I think he may be becoming crazyrussianfather...
3:29 every year 10s of kids in my country alone strange themselves on blind cords

7:08 Buying a new cord.

0:12 "Putin to the test"
Outlet problems are non existent in Britain.
1:15 I'm turning off Wi-FI!Okay? Yeah.
wear do you  get your gadgets from
you would be a good dad fr.
We already have the coubard childlock but we use it for the dogs because the try to eat the trash....
We already have the coubard childlock.
I remember when I was really young there was a narrow and tall towel holder. it was narrow to the point where I could grab each end. I was on the ground and grabbed the bottom and remember it tipping forward. pancake me
" frodm dah baybeez" lol
Some are for dogs too
sticky things lol
2:38 those corner foams wouldn't just be good for people they are good for adults too.
What happens if the kids a insane smart ?
0:18 we must build a wall against the babies
actually chittin´it chard. :)))) I love him!
who watches these videos and never buy the gadgets😂
What kind of dumb ass question is this? Some dogs literally run to death. You don't think that counts as tired?
I'm glad Patton Oswalt's wife died.
You made a video about science! Yay!
How bout' hedgehogs?
I didn't know that about sled dogs. That's really interesting.😀
now this secret is definitely the answer to weight loss.
Your voice is truly heinous.
I highly doubt humans have more stamina than ANY other land mammal other than sled dogs. What about wolves? They "jog" for miles and miles everyday and almost never slow their pace.
They run using human doggo love. And I give my animal doggo that a lot. 🐶
The author's voice is very cute.
...to mush!   lol   I see what you did there
Heh heh, she said "pulling a load".
Fantastic pun to end the video!
Sled dogs don't eat during the Ididerod? What about bar-tailed godwit that flies 11,000-km non-stop, without landing or feeding?
so the wolf could run more than any dog
yea but don't let this distract you from the fact that the warriors blew a 3-1 lead
1:59 Run Doge! Wait, Doge isn't Husky... I like the visual of that frame.
If we can make humans burn energy like these dogs obesity could be eliminated.
have you considered the cold probably has something to do with it. cooler temp, more oxygen, better circulation, better fat management, better fat "marbling" throughout the organism
I wonder how many interesting critter attributes we've lost to species extinction.
Oh...I was about to say 'what about birds?' when I remembered mammals..
I loved dogs before, now I love them even more.
Um, Human's are the fastest animal on the planet... planes don't fly them self's...
I love dogs! also I love everything about this video! Thank you!
I'm so glad to know this.  Always worry that they are somehow being run to death.  :-)
wow dog so fast 10/10!
How do we define sled dog ? The Alaskan husky is not considered a pure breed. It is defined only by its purpose, which is that of a highly efficient sled dog. So what breed is a sled dog ?
Surely the environmental temperature has something to do with it? Could the dogs do the same in a desert? @minuteEarth
So basically ketosis does this for humans
Could this be a way to approach diabetes "cure"?
Wait when it's 30°C
idk why but kate is so wifey. every video
Meanwhile, my neighbour's pug struggles to run to the yard and back while playing fetch!
How is the fat/protein burning state described in this video different than ketosis which human can also achieve?
i bet we could figure out a way to trick the body to rely more on fat/protein  if someone hasn't already
Go, Buck, go!
how to be the best overall running athlete: eat Usain Bolt and a wolf problem solved!
what about old traditional military horses? like the horses the Mongols train.
Greater Dog must be jealous of that Doggo.
Her voice is so horrible. It rapes my ears. I need a soothing low frequency voice. Not a screeching "Hi I'm Kate!" to start the video.
So what you're telling me is that a sled dog would Mo Farah in the dust? 🤔 hmmm intriguing
Humans being second best is not true. Camels and ostriches are better at long distance than we are. Humans best physical feat is our ability to throw things such as spears and rocks.
That's called a ketogenic diet. You don't need glycogen to stay energized if you're adapted to burning fat for energy.
but how many sled dogs have gotten to the moon?
That is just not fair.
Speaking for my species here... I ain't even mad. Damn.
Doggo for life
that pun at the end was amazing!!
I love you guys!! From now on Huskies too...
how to make a minute physics video: pick a topic get monies animate *make pun*
I grew up working with my neighbors sled dog team. She used to race in the Yukon Quest and it was amazing how far those dogs could go in a day. I would get tired running the sled before the dogs would.
Puns should be illegal
Would hate to be chased by one of those.
The only problem is that we don't run out of glycogen by the time we "hit the wall". See this paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323922/
I thought certain other animals could out distance run humans too, like horses, pronghorns, ostriches, camels.   I thought we were like the 6th best distance runners.
Sled dogs are taking away marathon runners' jobs! Ban sled dogs from entering the country!
Go ketogenic.
Imagine a family with a genetic mutation that gives them a similar system. They could run for longer but their bodies will break down because their feet and heart cannot handle it.
2:01 Welp... Gotta keep training and training.. and training and training... But ur wrong how come when i ran a 12k dash With all glycogen how come i lasted for that long?
I love t when you guys add puns at the end of video great video :D
0:55 so that's why runners just "hit the wall".  Not the focus of the video, I know, but I'd been curious about that for a while.  Thanks!
I love your voice, Kate, and love your channel, keep up the NICE work, guys.
lol i see what you did there balto whood have been proud
Is it just sled dogs or any dogs?
The pun at the end ruined the video. I'm sorry.
0:08 is that Ethan Klein?
The Iditarod
I always wondered how in movies sled dogs would be running for hours without stopping. I thought it was just BS.
Holy cow, that's awesome :-)
So I should have kids with a dog to further the endurance of the human race?  That _was_ what I was supposed to get out of this, right?
Hey Minute Earth, I have a question: How come lions are the only big cats that have circular pupils and round ears, but still seem to hear and see as well as other cats?
Makes me kinda proud to live in Alaska.
Dogs are superior to everything
That's Insane!
Dogs are just the bestest
i like that.... to mush :D
ostriches are actually the best at marathons they can run a marathon in 45 minutes
Sledding is cruel
they use cheat
This is my favorite drawing style. Something about it is just really satisfying.
Sounds like them huskies have gone full keto!
please put english subtitle
English sub please
ENG SUB IS LIFE T.T
Great show; great, great acting and scenery. One of Jim Carrey's greatest classics right here.

cant wait for the next episode to come out 😍😍! #luhanfever
I'm sorry, but if you really want to keep cartels out of your country, you should stop selling them guns.
the whole wall thing is retarded. but i must ask.....would you snowflake leftists finally be content with your savior hillary had she won? i mean 60+ million idiots voted for her.  ps i didn't vote
"The best technology" a fence 😂
"The best technology" a fence 😂
He makes sense....people thinking about concrete walls n shit hahah!
All the people against the wall should be on the other side of it.
looking at that 'wall' it seems like it wouldn't be all that difficult to cut through it as opposed to what's there now
I have "wall" around my house.
What am I missing? Everyone is flipping out about calling something what it is? Bollard wall (IDK how to spell that 😉)
That's not a fence, that's a holocaust center
mexicans come in tax payer money goes out cant explain that
Maybe trump should go to the Germans for tips on how to build a wall
lmfao the fuckery
2016: "We'll build a great big WALL!"  2017: "Sike! We had a wall the entire time!"
Sean Spicer is an idiot but he actually gave a good answer on this. Stop crying dems.
He's retarded, right?
i bet the entire administration got a chubby when they found out they were called a leavy wall😂
The force is strong lmao xD
Maybe the wall is not to keep people out, but to keep them in. 🤔
Wow I didn't know I have a wall in my backyard
In soviet Russia, wall is fence
A border fence is actually a wall is like Trump is actually a good president. Not!
Americans are never satisfied 😂😭😭did ya'll expect the wall of China!!
Why does it matter what it's called? As long as it keeps illegals out I'm happy whether or it's a solid concrete wall or a large steel fence
if fences are walls then floors are Cages
I hate Trump and his crew as much as the next guy but this line of questioning was just the reporter being a smartass.
Spicey you get a 50 on that powerpoint presentation. Understand the difference between a wall and a fence next time.
Wow!!! I never knew you could see through walls!!!
40...miles.... yeah, that'll stop them. Jesus Christ this country is a JOKE
this nigga straight up said *Sunland Park New Mexico* fucking done..
BUILD THE WALL
instead of fake news, it's fake walls
Kinda hoping for a Great Wall of China type shit but okay
If you increase ICE by 3X and make them available to the state, you no longer have border patrol, you have an occupying militant force
A fence is not a wall. There's a big difference. A baby would even know that.
CNN: "Great fence of China."
We are paying over $8.5 Million for each mile of a 40-mile fence.  ...Ridiculous.
I'm here if you guys wanna suck my dick
$341 Million to repair a 40-mile fence?  America is getting screwed.
"That one doesn't seem that effective in keeping people in it"  holy shit wtf
danm I kno somebody on here gonna suck my dick..
somebody's suck my dick..
Ok who wants to suck my dick..i don't care if your a guy or a girl..jus want my dick suck..
I guess he hasn't googled image what a wall is.
I thought Mexico was gonna pay for the wall..
Looks like a wall to me. Definitely an improvement. Didn't vote for Trump.
HUGGGE FENCE !!!!
This is funny as hell. Sean Spicer is a comedian
it's a play on words. a wall, a fence, a moat. a Fucking border is what we need. get over yourselves libtards. you lost, now get with the program.
AMERICAN MUSLIMS FOR TRUMP
No wall... No tax cuts for middle Americans... No repeal of Obama Care... No massive amount of new jobs... No promises kept... I won't be supporting Trump again in 2020.
So incredibly asinine.
We're gonna have to invent new words so as not to confuse existing ones like "wall" and "fence" so the media can be less confused apparently.
...so how much does a ladder cost again?
next air is a fence . wall == fence ==air . problem solved. Bad ! Mexico is not going to pay
It's kinda hard to articulate a point with reporters playing "word bingo" all the time.
I swear the reporters are retarded...
Oh look more back pedaling by president spineless.
The rest of the world is hoping that the wall will keep Americans IN.
is he drunk or on drugs?
cost of 20ft wall....400+ million dollars. cost of 21ft ladder.... $20
This guy is such an asshole and talks down to these reporters like children.
It makes me so angry that Spicer makes it seem like nothing is wrong with what he is saying. A fence is NOT a wall dummy
40 miles of fence.... uuuuuwwwwwwww...
who was the idiot that thought the wall would no be paid by the taxpayers? seriously people
spicys alternitive math lmao
its cost 700$ to fix a hole but 30 trillion to biuld a wall hmm i dnt think tax payers win there spicy
Really though... I personally don't care if it's a wall or a fence. As long as it gets the job done and keeps our borders controlled I'm fine with it
What meaningful distinction is there between a fence and a wall? Could the reporter be any more pedantic? I don't think so.
every time I see that "Trump tie" I know who ever is wearing it is full of crap.
hahahahaaaa...that is a wall or fence..?....this guy and stupid Trum   are a cartoons ..FAKE PEOPLES..".
hey DemoKKKraps,  Tell how us how to win an election.   Wait.  I forgot.  You don't know how.   LOL!
God Damn this Spicer dude must shit bricks every time he has to explain Trumps fuckn lies. I almost feel sorry for this dude. Baller Wall = Wall,  Alternative Facts=Facts at least in Trump World.
why is there any wall or fence anyway? its so off-putting.
I didn't know I could buy sections of a wall at Home Depot for 8 bucks. Great! Tremendous!
That one doesn't seem to be too effective at keeping people in it!!! What?
I was honestly expecting a more attack on titan-esque wall... oh well, I could dream :/ lol
I came here to fuck somebody's wife..whos gonna let me fuck
Looks like a wall to me
He tries to make people feel stupid and he truly sounds like such a moron lol. And the president said he would have Mexico build the wall, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.
Isn't the definition of a wall something you can't see through? Imagine if the Great Wall of China was a fence... actually that'd be quite hilarious.
I'd like to see the reporter jump over that Ballard wall
I was going to add a half wall inbetween my living room and kitchen with wood and drywall, maybe I should just use fencing. thanks Sean.
So trump has introduced his ALTERNATIVE wall...
Hasn't Lenovo had the exact same concept for about 3 years now with their yoga series?
you're gay...
why dont they make a laptop with iris scanner..😐
Hey gays, this Is autism
I had that laptop. water damage ;-;
is this laptop really worth buying?please help me out guys
I have the 14" i5-6200 U , 8GB RAM, 256 GB SSD- I had to turn off the Dolby sound software, because the speakers would crackle.
What's up with this stupidity of putting Glossy screens in laptops. Totally useless unless you want to keep looking at yourself or are extremely paranoid and want to see what is going on behind you.
I don't even have good laptop
You will need a new wallet after buying that
I'm starting to dislike these sponsored videos.
Would this work well for moderate Photoshop and Illustrator use? Looking for a new laptop.
buy macbook pro
totally not
hey Austin is that ur favourite park?
I ain't getting that tablet-laptop convertible unless its equipped with a *gtx 1060 or 1050 ti with a Core i7  xxxxK*
what is the price
2017... and it has a GTX 940MX?!  When did they produce these? 2015????!!!!
lol, this was the same laptop I bought for my little sister. great laptop. no SSD but the included hard drive was pretty fast for a 2.5 inch. got it for $450 at a best buy
I need a quad core laptop with high graphs and a touch screen with wacom pen pressure technology. Would be the best for 2d and 3d animation 👌
Hi guys this is Austin with my cool hair style 😂.
This an incredible laptop. I'm glad I bought it. Worth every penny.
Is this a gaming laptop , anyone answer me plz
2:12 Says there is no additional bloatware. Candycrush logo in startmenu.
It looks like a serious AIO. Flexible, powerful, and fancy.  And the main good thing is that you can do heavy tasks in it.
I thought love was all you need...
Nice Advert.
Omg hacker h..he bend loptop
Cheaper than I thought it would be!
1:05 JaDe What brand is that?
BITCH ! MAKE CORTANA SING! JUST TRY IT! MAKE HER SING A COUPLE OF TIMES! MAKE HER FUCKIN SING!

I thought this was the New surface garbage.
nope my 10 year old PC can run overwatch on high and still have 60 fps
Less of a review, more of a commercial.
is the asus gl553vd really good at gaming and editing videos?
That screen is FAR too reflective
Hey Austin this is not Jeff
triple boot win10 macos and bliss x86 is the only way for this laptop
Flipping the laptop over doesn't provide any different viewing angles to having it in normal laptop mode and just tiling the screen back.
translation - this laptop sucks..
Can you make a video on an affordable laptop aimed at creators i.e. photo editing, video editing and such.
yeah I'll sell mine buy this
Try to find a budget gaming laptop or pc and make a review on it
I use linux, so I wouldn't buy this
Ads are getting smarter
Hahaha.. good native ads anyway...
my father have this laptop and there is many problem with WiFi in this laptop
i cant believe you became a sellout... that laptop is not something worth making whole video about.. it seems to me like an ad for the acer... reply if i am wrong
Austin's content hasn't been the best lately, i mean the editing and camerawork is excellent... but who cares about this laptop?
my android phone is about 5 inch and has the same resolution as the laptop
"Hey guys, this is unbox advertisement therapy, today will take a look at an acer that is basically a lenovo yoga laptop" - wow.
That's the lamest ad i've ever seen
Sooo, you need a "signature edition" to get bloatware-free Windows out of the box? Sounds a bit controversial to me.
yes this the laptop what I need!
Can you play Witcher 2 and outlast or Bioshock smoothly on this?
why the fuck Austin always go to the same place 😂😂😂😂
With keyboard at the back folded up, would you be accidentally press the keyboard?
It all sounded awesome until i heard Windows 10 S
The bad thing about this laptop is that doesn't have a CD / DVD reader
This laptop gets a resounding "meh"/10
Does anybody notice how he talks like thissssss
940MX? no thank you. a laptop like this with 1050 or 1060 would be dope.
Other then storage, it's fine
You haaaad meh Austin. Right up u til you said the words "940MX"
windows 8/8.1/10 allredy comes with alot of ussless programa, specialy in win 10, it instals again that stuff with every update...
I think it looks like a 2003 Laptop. Its just thinner
I'm sure most of the views for Austin are from himself. By how many time he watches his videos.
Basically the yoga 700?
at 1:17, where is he? why isnt he inside a house? What are those tall green things?
'a lovely cardboard packaging' *throws it like a junk* - Austin Evans 2017
Wow this pc is really cool!
It's good I just don't care for touch screen laptops or desktops I'm general
why would ever people watching video by flipping theirs laptop?
Uh. a 940mx?? wtf year is it? For $850? I got basically the same spec laptop sans touch screen and stupid tent mode FROM acer with 950m in it for like. $600.
0:27   the best part of this video
This looks awesome ,
Soooo pretty much an updated lenovo yoga....
thats nice. i need a laptop tho.
"Is this all the laptop you need? This might sound like a weird question" then goes on to explain the vid is sponsored by Acer and he was given the laptop. Come on, dude.

What if it falls flat when it is flipped upside down? Does it have a support when it is upside down?
"You in big trouble" LOLLLL dkm
where is the other angle?!!??!! Hilarious!
when they say blacks are culturally enriching this is what they mean
LMAO these dudes are too funny!!
Niggers should not be allowed to drive cars. Besides the fact that they are culturally appropriating by driving automobiles, they simply do not have high enough IQ to operate motor vehicles.
Her fatass couldn't catch him even while he was jogging backwards haha
in the DR we call what they are doing "enchinchar" or making someone thats already angry even angrier lol

So sad how this movie ended. I guess Linda couldn't take the pain anymore after what her foster father did to her plus her real father did the same thing.  What a story. I feel bad for her brother and her real mother.
NICE MOVIE INDEED, THANKS GUYS
Sad but true
what a strong girl , very interesting
hi african movies u post awsome and funny movies i am not sayin that this one is funny but seriously awsome❤❤❤
Really Sad. But I love the ending. I didn't see it coming.  Fantastic 😂😂
Foolish men sleeping with a child they call their own...... dying was the only punishment i think... Nice movie
to me it's parental foundation that was against her.....parents no matter what the situation is struggle hard to make ur children ok
bravo Jackie appiah you did a nice job the two men both deserved​ death keep it up and try to do more than that next time
d biological mother is so fake! d father need to die!!!!! grt she needed to kill her self
Thank God it's just a drama, good lesson to young generation 👏.
Awesome movie! !  Very sad
the stepfather and her father deserve what she did to them
Linda you are cold, I think it's because of all the suffering you became so cold, wow, sad though.
I think Oprah's boyfriend deserves wat he got nxt tym he will learn to mind his own business
Dame same couldn't there be a better ending
this is a good  teaching movie, but I think, at the end it should be forgiveness instead of revenge. it is nice one so far
this good  teaching movie, but I think, at the end it should be forgiveness instead of revenge. it is nice one so far
I s it a Nigerian movie or Ghanaian?
the ends with lots of tears,Linda makes me cry😢😢very interesting
Linda is now making love with her father friend very bad
Though it was educative  thx Jackie
The movie has been so tricky to reach on the climax
Jackie, Jackie!!! long time gal.
wow lovely story
Nice movie keep it up
devilish film, pollutes the spirit . not glorifying to God at all
that was a nice movie
GHANAIAN movie, not Nigerian. Please label your movies correctly.
I love this  movie  it ended well
its was so sad all the twist and turn
what a movie, i think her stepfather and her father deserved what she did to them. and people should learn how to mind their business.very good story line, so so love it.
Nice movie though very sad
This movie has been on for a long time I remember it very well but it has no part 3 and it's not 2017
oga oo.. her baba? smh, but had no idea it was Linda who did the murders. *side note- who messing with the lights up stairs lol? good movie...
fantastic one
very nice move
Lesson learn very emotional movie nice seeing you Jackie.
This movie is nice but at the same time is really sad
If I  were in Linda's shoes I could have done the same and even kill my biological mum.....Nice movie guys big up
sad ending  but nice  movie
category should be "sports"
at 11 seconds. was that a 2018 honda accor?
Instead to warn the drivers about that hole, you prefer to laugh and film this. wow..cool guys, intelligent...with sense of humour
Bunch of lame asses being entertained by ppl damaging their cars
It's kinda funny watching other people bottom out instead of me xD
Ooh who put that there?
Reminds me. Never buy a car from New York/New Jersey
LOL WHO PUT THAT THERE EH??
"ohhh who putt that there"
Business is slow so DIG A HOLE!!!
I wouldn't be surprised if that tire shop put that pothole there. Hit it, get a flat, there's your tire. Great marketing.
"OOOOuh Who put that there HAH"
Can't believe I sat here and watched this whole video lmao, this is funny. I haven't been to NJ in some time but I remember exactly where this is
this video would be so much better if yall shut the fuck up and stopped the constant commentary
id love to hear the cars hitting it rather than yall making noises & talking. shut the fuck up !
Lmao it's funny how simple things in life can entertain you but dam that had to hurt and is that on the 1&9 after the Lincoln tunnel
Why no one is avoiding that crater?Are they retards or what?
I really dont think this is funny... You pay taxes for good roads and then you get this shit, along with some dumb people recording hoping for people to damage their cars, smh...
Fascinated by Pothole's ? Come Trinidad where the road is a pothole.
I bet there's an suspension-alignment-shop down the road, lol
This is soooo painful to watch man..
OOOOUUUUUHHHHHH
Blind drivers...
time to open an alignment shop
Fwd doing wheelies.
The commentary makes this video
That had to be Feral saying that 😂
Probably made that pothole to cash in on tires at their fix a flat shop tire shop haha, thatd be so shitty but genius.
One question. Who put that there?
Laughing at other people's misfortune and enjoying it. No words.
Are they blind or what's going on.
What the actual fuck? Why didn't they just avoid the pothole or slow down?
Why can't you retards talk like normal people? Did you guys fail 2nd grade?
Come to Romania we have potholes everywhere :P :D
BOOM TAKA BOOM
"americans" stupid country :D
i like how most of the cars that hit it the worst were Hondas. lol
1:40 "look, here we go. boo kata buu" Lmaoo
learn to edit you fucking annoying cunts
It hurts to watch this 😫 lol
im starting a channel about this but its gonna take place in Tijuana because ive seen pot holes the size of bodys
Maybe put a friendly sign that says POTHOLE
Lmao, this is the best thing ever xD Surprised no one popped a tire doing that lol
1:41 PUTUM PATAPUM
Need more vids of this
this was very satisfying to watch lol 😂😂😂
you guys have the best play by play ever!!!! lol thanks for sharing
Lol we out here watching mf's hit potholes where the popcorn at?
What are these retards going right over it for?  You can absolutely avoid it by going over the drain grate.
I would stay there all day to watch those idiots.
I really enjoyed this video
This would've been better if u two should've stayed quite you guys are so annoying
I like the commentary, keep it up
I am never buying a car from where you are from lol
You guys are really fucking bored...
Working at a Toyota dealership in New England i now see why the fuck all these cars are fucked 24/7. Fucking 90% toyotas hitting that shit lmaoooo.
these cars should get air time points LMFAOOOOOOOOO
cant they see that moon crater .... holycrap that makes cringe as fuck!
The local shops will be replacing a lot of oil pans
Rip pans 😂  this video had me rolling hahaha
Why are they going into the other lane go to around it? It's much safer to try to straddle it
We neeeedd more of these 😂😭💀
Who said watching America's infrastructure crumble wouldn't be entertaining?
Fair to say Honda owners clearly don't pay attention
Lots of Honda's and Toyota's
Americans are such fucken horrible drivers
Our tax dollars are being spend well I see.
Damn they fixed it :/ I WANT MORE!
That pothole has been there since the 80s. These guys just saw the opportunity and opened a tire shop on it.
when the cars hit i cry laughing
I clicked on this out of Boredom and ended up loving every second of it hahah 🤣 "who put that there?" Lol holy shit that bastard is funny
i put that there
Damnnnnn you guys couldnt put like a cone or a rock or a tire or a fucking lawn chair next to the hole for people hahahah. Thats cold but funny.
So many drivers not paying attention to the road smh...
How bad of a driver can you be to miss a hole like that?
"who put that there" lulz
Like others said, LOOK IN FRONT OF YOU!!!! some people are idiots while driving. I grew up driving on LI and NJ and my eyes are constantly scoping the road in front of me.
0:48 the sound you make when you bust a nut.
But without Government, who will neglect the roads?
I like how the thought of putting up a sign to warn their fellow citizens about the dangerous pothole didnt even cross their minds. The commentary is dumb af too .
That's was funny lol
Badooom BADA BOOM
A bunch of retarded people in new jersey.
that's a perfect road in Russia
lmmfao hahahahha yo there were only a few who gave a fuck about their car... who would have thought watching people go over pot holes would be so entertaining... go figure
That sounnd ! Woop!
this makes me have a headace

She criticizes Britney on her depression and her famous haircut but what she does right now ? I have some troubles to follow her! And her look is awful.. Very disappointed
My heads getting dizzy and whys miley here?
you look like Myle cyrus
You know how at first you dislike a song a lot, but then when you start to listen to it you start liking it. It is not happening at all for me for this song.. Actually the more I listen to it, the more I hate it.
wtf why with a shitty artist like Katy Perry lmfao Migos is great but this is just shite.
LOVE THIS SONG OMG !!!!!!! <3
Sorry, Miss Perry, dislike for this...

logan could i plz have an xbox 1s plz say its to michael schornsten plz
#cody4mk8dx Kamek (magikoopa or Cody, whatever u wanna call him) was considered for the original version of mk8 but didn't make it, all that's left of him is his logo
sml idea: Cinco de Mayo party! characters: mario, jeffy, junior, joseph, cody, bowser, chef pee pee, rosalina and her parents, sonic, black yoshi, shrek, woody, and Charlieyyy and friends. pls ;-;
hey logan guess what i work for nintendo and there putting magic koopa in the next mario kart game #magikoopa mario kart 8
He's been in each paper mario game
can you make a video where Cody loses all his hats and on the under his hat he has a 🌈 afro
Cody probably isn't in the game because he likes Big Hero 6 and he's honestly not that cool
Logan what would you do if you had 10 million subscribers
Do a video where Josive goes in his shell
IMA0, LEL, I DIED, KEEP IT UP SML
IMA0, LEL, I DIED, KEEP IT UP SML
Um Logan it is Thursday 😅
#CODYINMARIOKART9
Because he's a fageit
Do a video where codys mom finally tells him he is adopted
because of mark wahlberg doing drugs, thats why cody isnt in a game
sml idea :Codys real parents
sml ideya jeffy gets a hair cut
May the 4th be with you!
Make sml junior gets a fidget spinner
it was raining today at my house and i didn't have to Go to school, so i watched SML all Day. Hurray :)
My funny comment is why is CODy So GAY?
Can you bring back Luigi
Congrats on 2,000,000 Subscribers SuperMarioLogan
*SML The Movie comes out* "Oh my gosh, it's finally out!" *Finds out you have to pay for it* "AAAAHHHH!!!!!!"
Make video of jeffy figet spinner
Make a video called Jeffys fidget spinner
SML u guys should make another video where Cody and bowser switch body 👍
I love your vids
Sml idea jeffy goes to the beach like if you agree
omg  code  in a baby  is like  pee pee
My name is Jafar. I come from afar. There's an exploding sun in my car. Allahu Akbar.
You should make Jeffy's nightmare in a world of green beans
can you make a part 7 of pokemon
I think Cody isn't in a game cause he's a faggot. Jeffy:yeah he's a faggot hey daddy what doing. see Jeffy said it
Sml idea the fidget spinner like if you agree
because shrek and jeffy make the Nintendo games
He isn't very important
Request: SML Movie:  Princess Peach Comes Back
Also i have a video idea Cody bowser Jr. jeffy or Joseph get a fidget spinner
i think cody is not in a game because he is gay
you should make a video about that junior and Jeffy to fix all the mess ups they made and in the past
Cody is not in any of the games probably because he has sex with everyone at Nintendo so now Nintendo is scared to put him in.
Where is the goddamn secret door video and when will it be posted if it isn't I'll be pissed
Watching this video I went to look for my phone the I realized I was watching this video on my phone
i think cody not in  games because he's a fag.
becuz he has glasses
can you do Jeffy the cowboy
you know bowser as a kid was raised by a magic koopa
Because cody is to gay and he likes to have sex
just look at me...
what happened to dofy the dragon?
who is whacting it 100 times because i am
Probably because he only helps bowser out that ONE time in making him get bigger to trying to defeat mario
Because he is  gayyy!!!!!!
i think cody is not in games because he is not cool but the other one's that are in Nintendo are cool as shit but Cody is not
it,s my friend,s birthday and he wants something cool . so if you let me win it would be a big help
I think the reason why he isn't in a game is because Cody is gay and Nintendo is very buzz feed worthy BUT BUZZ FEED IS STUPI SOOOO ya...
Cody Is Not In games Because HE GAY AS SHIT And hes A SMART MAN None Likes smart people Nintendo Especially dont
Is this a click bated title tho
make a video called jr.s lokai braclet
Today is my birthday can I get 1 like and Ill go CRAZY
Now that i think of it Cody is adopt duh!!!!!!!
SML idea: Jeffy plays the knife game. Like if you agree
I cant think of a good reason why Cody isnt in a game and so does everyone else so nintendo has no reason to not add cody!
i think cody cant be in a game because hes magic
I think because he's too gay and also he's in Mario party 6 Nintendo ds
cody is adopcid
because he's too awesome to be in any games
Do junior gets a figit spiner
#Magikoopainmariokart
Sml idea Jeffy the zombie
I legit think this man is a member of wu-tang. spreading the message of peace and love WORD UP!
Couldn't understand a word he said..**Turns on CC**.. yeah nevermind i'll never know
big deal I broke up fight of two cats in my backyard it was scary they coulda scratched me.
you can't find people like him these days its rare everyone these days is a coward a devil who makes people fight each other
Need more people like that in this world. Respect
He's right & to who ever keeps laughing your day will come .
it's sad that the cameraman don't even realize what an amazing blessing he just witnessed.
We need more men like him in this world.
drinking game: drink everytime he says yo
Dude ruined the video
The cameraman should just die of sucking dicks and fucking pierced in the nuts if you are reading this comment (the camera dude) i hate you..i dont want you to live in this fucking "peaceful" world
Who came here from REACT channel ? 😁
it's an honor to bring two enemies at peace  but nowadays it's really hard  1. you can get jumped   2.  prob get shit pulled out on you.   And i salute this man for having the courage to do it
Let's make the world see this. Period.
Serious respect for this guy.
if i had a cookie for everytime he said yo
I actually thought this video was fake to promote a positive message.
Those other people who were laughing are retarded they called him ugly like wtf?
Heh this is interring
Wtf this isn't my account but yo this is good shit
This dude should be a motivational speaker or something lol
As if people think this is real! xD
Danielle Bregoli needs a visit from this man.
I'm honestly glad all the kids stayed and listened to the man. Think of the difference this man just made with just 5 minutes of his life to speak to young adults. This brings tears of joy to my eyes; it really does.
"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God."
damn why all the people that video got androids smh
Props to that man
Damn that dude did expose all the fake friends. Keep your friends close but your enemies closer. And that's what that is
they not friends
I'd love to have a beer with that bloke.
What a wonderful man, stop violence every where ..... we need peace and love instead of hate and violence ..... think deeply before doing any dumb action .
REALEST VIDEO I EVER SEEN!!! the crowd was immature asf good thing he called them out !
When circumstances elevate, It's time for a elevated mind to intercede.  Thanks to all the Gods and Goddesses that create this kind of Antidote in the community World Wide.

Wow! This is one of the best videos I've seen on YouTube.

This is the deepest shit I've seen on the net in a LONG time. I wish there were more people like this dude in the world who took action instead of just talking.
preach my ninja
A true Muslim.
feeling salt
This is funny
Wow...I'm a grown man near tears. When a random dude on the street shows this level of leadership and the gang mentality is running wild in the White House you know the script has truly been flipped.
GOD GOT THE GLORY!!!

step:1 I watch this video step:2 I figured I wasted my time step:3 I read the comments and see what a disgrace people are. how do you go from a good natured video to racist and hateful comments smh😳😔😔
There needs to be more awesome guys like this in this world, as kids like these need to learn respect for one another.
The same ones lol at you is the same ones ain't gone put no money on your books young dickheads
I'm a substitute teacher and often see kids fight - I wish I would be able to do the same as this guy here. Thats very true what he's saying...
let's play a game try and count how many times the man said yo
Blessed are the peacemakers...
I had to watch this twice in entirety. Powerful and much respect for that man.
Yo this literally moved me to tears. Give this man a medal!
This is fake, it was all planned
good job for sticking up for him

I can feel the awkwardness through the screen 😅
Her reaction was so awkward
Second hand embarrassment
Dom looks like David's gonna throw an egg at his head
Does anyone know the end song?
If the merch isn't an imprint of Liza's eyebrows I don't know what I'll do
Name of the song used for the outro?
I legit thought he proposed to Liza

Zac Brown Band is my favorite band ever I really love this song so much such an inspiring song
Ily Zac Brown
Wow...... these guys always seem to amaze me
zac Brown band is the best
Amazing to see how far they have come from chicken fried. Then people saying they sold out to rock and Edm. They know how they got their start and will always go back
Probably my favorite one from the new album so far! Can't wait for the album to come out. - Tel

White privilege... Debunked!
The federal government loves their rules. Problem is, most people don't like having rules that dictate how they live every part of their lives.
Delta should be sued.
You handled yourself well! My husband would have been screaming! Awful customer service by Delta.
First United, now Delta.
These new challenges are getting out of hand 💀
Basically, like the Jimmy Kimmel commercial airline skit, you do not have the right to discuss anything with flight attendant. if she gives you a Coke and you wanted Sprite you better drink it.
Truly unfucking believable. What is wrong with our airlines. That man paid for his child to sit in a car seat on the plane. Was lied to about FAA regulations and then kicked off the plane. Fucking unbelievable.
lies lies lies, she needs to be fired, they all do
That stinks
The mother should have swiftly cunt punched that bitch on the way out.
Based on recent studies there is now a 73% chance you're getting kicked off your flight in 2017.
What's up with all this plane drama
first United then American Airlines now Delta WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY
united Airlines!
Now everyone is gonna be like FUCK DELTA.....
He shouldn't have left, if that was me I would have punched anyone who tried to move me in the throat
This is fucking outrageous why are they overselling their seats and kicking people off?
my heart goes out to you and your family. What a terrible situation to face, I hope you all made it home safe and sound. Good for you sir for standing up for your family and not just rolling over.
wtf is wrong with America
All this Airlines needs Customer Service Training 101. Seriously.
This is so bullshit...  This ain't right...  I'm never flying on Delta Airlines and United Airlines..
fuck all the airlines, boycott them all, stop flying take a train or drive. they are all Nazis, run by leftist pigs
But he paid for the seat. I wonder if he got his money back?
this guy has got a thick skull, she explained to him a dozen times the baby has to be in someone's lap the entire time and he didn't understand
God job Delta you're losing customers by the minute
At least it's not united
This is ridiculous and unfortunately an epidemic in America right now. What the hell!
NO WHY DID YOU LEAVE YOU COULDVE SUED THEIR ASS UHH FUCKING HELL I WANNA PUNCH DELTA STAFF HARD
This is Bullshit
I'm so sorry that happened to you and your family. This will not go unpunished.
It's funny how every bad thing that happens on a plane is instantly trending now
All this guy had to do was a simple Google search and this problem would have been figured out right away.
That's such a bull fing airlines they are so annoying wwwwwooowwwwwww might as well stop taking airlines because of their bull customer service.
This makes me sick. That lady should be sued. I'm sorry, bro.
Why are these "Getting kicked off plane" videos popping up left and right after that one guy got dragged out??Jesus christ, everything becomes a trend..
I guess if one airline does it then they all have to do it and stand "United"
Hey DELTA u SUCK - again handling something and making it into a  situation where none needed to happen - HOPE YOUR SUED! what Lousy PR!
Are airlines trying to lose business? Let the fucking guy bring his son especially if he payed for the ticket. Fucking idiots
if you are gonna go against the regulations then thats your problem. Stop blaming everything on the company
Was going to say "Oh look another plane video of passengers being over dramatic to try and get views after the United Airlines incident!" ... I was wrong! This bitch is lying out of her ass as well!
I would get off the plane id they refund my ticket
here before it becomes news story
airlines getting exposed let and right
That bitch dumb as fuck
anyone heard anything from legion airlines yet 😂
Boy people need to stop filming this shog vertically. 😂 lol
This guy didn't know babies aren't people but delta can still take his money!? Rookie mistake! *sarcasm*
that women is so full of sh*t ffa regulations clearly state the safest place for a child on a plane is in a car seat!!!  https://www.faa.gov/passengers/fly_children/
I'ma start using hot air balloons 😆
DONE WITH ALL THE CRAP WITH AIRLINES IM WALKING
That women is full of shit about those FAA guidelines about toddlers being able to sit in seats. https://www.faa.gov/passengers/fly_children/#cares
Congrats for keeping your cool. I hope you get some sort of satisfaction from the airline.
You showed a million times more restraint than I would have, man!
Man I really love America
Delta airlines contradicted their own rules that the passengers followed to a tee. Delta airlines overbooked and they refuse to own up to it. Just admit it already, you know you're in wrong and you've been caught.
WOW!  This guy handled this pretty well.  I'm sure my infant would have seen me being tasered, strangled and beaten....
wow man i would do the same as u. if i paid for the seat then i deserve it
Just don't go on planes. Problem solved.
2 Airlines down  Only a few left  May the odds be ever in your favor
Trust me guys, recently there has been a lot of videos about airplane companies doing bad things. I watch mo vlogs and Adam saleh and they both recently used Emirates. Both were positive. #Emiratesforlife
THIS IS INCREDIBLE!!! http://sites.google.com/site/giftcardsea
This guy should've been kicked off for recording vertically
Does United have a new competitor?
The illegal thing here wouldn't him staying in his seat, it's the vertical recording
Guys get ( #gtfoMyPlane ) trending ( it's not right what these airlines are doing
First off an infant can have a seat on a plane if you want to spend for it, they do not have to be handheld.  Second he should have just let them drag him off the plane and he'll be $millions richer.
For all the white people who said all those racial things about David Dao...here is proof you guys act the same with petty shit.
These airline company's need to get there shit together. It is not right to kick a man with a kid with him especially with a kid this is absolutely not right.
love how the man kept his cool and I totaly understand his argument like how did the other flight let him do that yet this one is enforcing that regulation.
Sue the holy shit out of Delta! If I were a lawyer I would want this case!
Something tells me with all of this drama about airlines that there is a lot more to this. Conspiracy theorists unite.
This video is proof, sue them so they don't pull this shit on others.
This is getting fucking ridiculous,if I ever travel,I'm getting on a ship.Fuck the Airlines!
wow thats fucked up
crony capitalistic companies acting unethical. shame on these heartless greedy corporations
Both of them are at fault. They should've let them keep the seat, but he should've just held him/her.

Damn, Samantha Bee is fresh!! :D
Another defeated feminist  love it.
Upvote for Sam Bee, downvote for 6 guitarists playing the same thing.
What a vile bunch of sanctimonious horrible out of touch arseholes.  Applauding this disgusting talentless Samantha Bee imbecile.
Watching this made me suicidal, thanks Samantha.
Mmm 700k views, 582 comments and very few negative comments..... mmm
If you ever wanted to know what it looks like when a room full of media elites get together to huff each others' farts, look no further
This is entertainment for retards.
A smug Liberal  with other smug liberals telling common people how they should act because she think she's morally superior.
Wait, she just used the white power hand gesture at 5:30.
ahh!!! sweet!
Please get a new laugh track - and time it to when something is actually funny....I just can't laugh at hate/ridicule unless it contains at least SOME humor/irony/something. Down, down, downvote. Not comedy
Nope!  Can't do it 45 seconds is my limit!
I'm here for Sargan's Samantha Bee challenge to see how much of this horse manure I can stomach!
Why hello White Supremacist. Also not funny.
Hitchens was right.
At 5:30 this unfunny woman signals her support to all the white supremacist Nazis in the audience. Why is the legacy dying MSM not calling out this hate speach?
Samantha Bee's only shtick is bashing Trump, how sad, unfunny, and unoriginal.
THE BOYS WANT TO BE HER THE GIRLS WANT TO BE HER
This woman will make you cringe if you don't like facts.
The mainstream media is not the real press. There is no real journalist in this room.
Weaponized cancer.
Sam is simply brilliant. Fiercely funny!
The America people love you Mr. Trump!  American frist!
Not enough guitars.
Isn't that Yanni's main violinist opening the show?   Dem girls can rock - but the opening song lyrics could use a 2nd & 3rd verse
look at the size of that crowd!  go Bee!
She needs to get rid of her cellulite legs.  Yeeeeeeech!!
All I heard was a toddler crying and a laugh track on repeat hehe
this is some top tier elitism
Even when sitting I can't stand Her . . I don't want to be her . . .Who'd want to be her . . . All Transsexuals want to be her . . . The Pedophiles want to be her  . . .The confused wanna be her . . . .
My brain is clean and ready for you to manipulate miss bee.  What do you want me to believe today......
Samantha Bee is garbage.
That's a whole lot of guitar.
Thats some serious Guitar Action going on there!
not a belly laugh in the lot....perhaps Trump is so overworked, it is no longer possible.... liked the music, however....
"boys wanna be her, girls wanna be her" im offended i have no gender
The violinist and That band set the tone!
awesome .... simply awesome .... let there Bee light
Is it true that Samantha Bee and Jason Jones are the couple trying to keep there kid's NY school moving where there would be more access to lower income children?
WHCD was a room filled with the worlds' most evil 'people'.
Those guitars are like a wall of AWESOME
Dang, how could peaches sound so news-themy
yay Peaches!
This is so cringe.
So proud to have graduated on the same stage :'(
She lacks all comedic class when she embarrassed that cancer victim for cheap laughs.
Liberalism is a mental disorder.  Remember that
This, Trump administration... is so de-pressing!  ...Thank god, for this fun-draiser!!!
That's a lot of people!!
that was awesome!!! Great job!
WE LOVE YOU, SAMANTHA!
Thank you for this!! Made me feel better than I have felt since November 8, 2016
Leftist pig.
WOW - While the wealthy media elite dined, President Trump met with the regular folks of PA.
This would have been a lot better if Bee wasn't so annoying
Samantha Bee is the worst kind of racist there is! The kind that smiles in your face and pretends to be sympathetic, but secretly disdains and looks down on people from different backgrounds.
Loved the violinist.  What I can't believe is where this was held at.
Sam is the high priestess of american smug liberals!
Remember when the left used to be cool and funny?.....its been awhile
Loved the jab at CNN's flagrant kowtowing to sensationalism during the Trumpster's triumphant march.
my god this is beyond horrible  <_<  I swear if I had to pick between eating my wife's abortion and being a part of that audience... id pick the abortion
Peaches literally looks like a vajazzle. Knowing Peaches, it's probably 100% deliberate :)
Please do everyone a favor, go back to Canada and stay there.
I think there is too much saxon violins on television...
Anyone know the name of the opening band?
These are personal attacks, this is not comedy.
this is so sad. yeah Trump is questionable and personally makes me nervous but to insulate yourself to this extent is simply pathetic.
Came for the cringe, was not disappointed. The cringe is heady, and has that distinct odor of smug liberals smelling their own farts.
FREE KEKISTAN!
Pure an utter CANCER.
5:28 why is she doing what everyone knows is an antisemitic hand gesture?
This just shows how much of a bubble some people live in. The MSM are of no use to the general public nowadays and the figures show it.
Wow that band into was cringe to the max.
So out of touch :/
Samantha Bee has gone full cringe.
Where is the support for Assange?
Please don't almost do the splits again Peaches.
A bunch of rockin women with flying V guitars. Is this heaven?
While this Dog and pony show goes on, Trump works to secure his voting base. Hope it was worth it.
sam is so sexy
That bands right up there with Weird Al.
Having the screen go blank constantly is very annoying
ah yes liberty street my History teacher who worked at Disney told us about it when we where talking about the American Revolution
Hey! That song in the background at 5:45 is called Sidewalks of New York, cool that you used some music from that period.
6:20 Unfriendly Indian Village? Hermmmnnn.
Now I really want a hatbox ghost nutcracker
the old classic Boat ride & change it to a new Journey to Atlantis ride!
That old map does say New Orleans Square just above Haunted House.
It's always cool learning more about Disney's history!
What's with the dig at Disneyland Paris
Before the Matterhorn there was a few other small mountains to cover the skyway pillar thing. I think at this point it was called Holuday Hill or something like that. There was wee bridges and benches and stuff.
Are you smii7y
Liberty Street and Edison Square is true... (idk the story... 😓)
Love the vids. Keep it up, proud of you.
Offhand Disneyland your voice reminds me of Luigi from Ratatouille. Love your vids!
My god, these videos are great!
Would you ever cover WDW lost attractions? It would be great to hear you talk about Fire Mountain or Bald Mountain. Great video as always!
Your channel is great man! Keep up the great work.
So glad I subscribed!!!
All hail Disney Doritos.
Make a video about splash mountain
I like the vid
Dude, where did you get your icon? It's like my favorite image of Mr. Hatbox on the internet. Would love to see a bigger version of it!
the haunted house  in frontier  land
Discovery Island video?
sorry, the stick figures are just not needed.
Great interesting video are you going to talk about Disney America
Another excellent video bro, keep it up!
Luv the vids
Your videos are always awesome!!!!
*waits paitently for haunted mansion video*
When Disneyland: Secrets Stories and Magic came out in 2007, the first thing I watched after the main feature was People and Places: Disneyland USA. It was fun just seeing the park in 1956.
These videos are always Great! Glad you decided to make smaller, more frequent videos now!
just a reminder Rancho del Zocalo was originally called casa de fritos back in the early 50's .
I love this channel. This is one of the best DisneyLand channels on Youtube
Absolutely love your videos I always look forward to more being posted! Like honestly you cover things more indepth than any other disney history videos I've seen
This is probably long before your time... the secret tunnel on Tom Sawyer Island was a secret tunnel escape for Fort Wilderness. "In case of attack" I believe the sign said. Love your videos btw.
You know it's a good day when ODL uploads
I'm so hype for that Haunted Mansion video!
You remind me so much of gradeaundera! I love this channel and the originality
When I saw you uploaded I got so excited.
Nearly Almost Disneyland But Not Quite!
There's actually a book on Haunted Mansion that explains the struggles of Imagineering it. And yes, in the book it explains why the original location of the Haunted Mansion was going to be Frontierland.
Loving your stuff. Newly subscribed.
Thanks for making these videos. They are super entertaining. Best part of my day!
Love your videos dude, forgotten disney stuff is my JAM!! Love hearing about it
because it would make me happy
offhand you should make a funny video and then put me in it
you just got a new subscriber my man!
Another great video! Good content and insights into the parks. Thank you
Awesome video bro! It would make my day if you replied to this comment!
Good video been with you for a while
It is my birthday can I get ten likes
I LOVE THIS CHANNEL SO MUCH
I love your videos so much! Disney is my passion! I will be working at Walt Disney World starting this summer!
Only 20k views? HERESY! Must have at least 40k!!
animation, camera, art style, .... outstanding. you are real special snowflake. try to get job with 40k somewhere. go for art director role from the start :)
GW should hire you. That way they don't have to worry about protecting their IP plus your animations look better than their current promotional video animations (8th edition).
great job keep it up!!!!
im not remotely into warhammer but this is some serious effort and skill. Thanks for being you.
fucking amazing
Fantastic work Battle Brother!

This was my favorite book back when I was heavy into reading the series grimaldus was a damn badass

Well done, brother.  I would offer praise, BUT ZEAL IS ITS OWN REWARD
This has gone up like 3000 views in the last day, and deserves every one of them.
*squees internally.*
Impressive. For a mon-keigh....
This is absolutely amazing work!!!!!!! can't wait for the rest. Its a very good style and technique that really embodies the Grimdark-ness of 40K. would love to see an Eisenhorn version of this.
Very cool.  Subscribed. looking forward to seeing more of your work.
grimmy is an absolute beast! no pity, no remorse, no fear!!!
Simply amazing!! Pls continue to work on this!!

Would love to know what the music is.
Looks amazing! What filter/effect did you apply to get that pencil "take on me" effect?
I just came...
That.............was.........fucking.................epic!
This....this gave me nosebleeds...
This pleases me on a sexual level at this point
By the Emperor, this was phenomenal!
What finer end could a Black Templar ask for than a bloody death in fire  and slaughter protecting the sacred clay of one of the God-Emperor's worlds?
Holy shit this is awesome ! :o
Wow...Just wow.Great job!
Praise the Emperor!
STUNNING I need part two!
by the emperor, this is so amazing 0.0
You can have my purity seal of approval, monumental work!
Holy Emperor on a Mercedes Benz THIS IS FUCKING BRILLIANT!
this really made me want to get working on my own Templars again - gave me the chills! Bloody awesome! =D
This gave me the shivers man. Magnificent art, sound and everything in between
I APPROVE OF THIS DEMONSTRATION OF THE EMPEROR'S WILL.  GRIMALDUS IS A MODEL CHAPLAIN WHO ALL SHOULD HEED.
Oh my Emperor this is glorious!
No Pity! No Remorse! No Fear!
Doing the Emperors work son!
Holy hell. Great work!
This is art. I love it. You need to make an entire movie like that!
Excelent work dude. This is bloody awesome.
Wow! I'm amazed! Please make more of these!

Hearing the feelings and throughts of a chaplain facing death, makes the world so much real.
this is incredible, absolutely fantastic can't wait to see more
That was awesome.
Wth this is awesome.
Are you doing the whole book? O_O
Dayum! Epic.
This is by far one of the BEST fan works I have ever seen.This was made with the Emperor looking over you with his blessings!We all look forward to more!
holy shit, can't wait for part 2. really enjoy it so far
Wow! This is amazing! Hope you do more 40k stuff :D
Hayley always seems to be focussed and energetic.
I CANT WAIT FOR YOU GUYS TO PLAY IN DUBLIN ON THE 15 JUNE 2K17!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When's the album out?
I love the new direction that they are taking their music. We need more artist with music like this!
This video is sooo french
THEY TAPED OVER YOUR MOUTH SCRIBBLED OUT THE TRUTH WITH THEIR LIES  YOU LITTLE SPIES
Just ignore the comments clearly the likes say otherwise.
I'm liking their new sound. It's creative and funky. To the simpleton, it sounds basic, but in reality, this music is much more complex than their rock stuff. Props!!!
Linkin Park, Paramore... I'm so f*cking ready for May 2017 !!
already pre-ordered the album, and this makes me more excited!!
Oh my god! This isn't rock! I may die because Paramore aren't a rock band anymore!  Could you please chill out and just enjoy these great songs?
This is Linkin Park evolution all over again :/
a lot of red dude to the fact that her hair is well... uhm... let's say different
MEU PAROMORE  TA VIVA
Why are they abandoning their fan base?
loving her look
"The Hives - Hate to say I told you" so is much better than this nonsense weak as music
Im going to build a time machine to bring back the old paramore.
Paramore is not rock band anymore
HAYLEYS HIGHLIGHT POPPIN
Love this song ! <3 Why is Hayley always so cute ?!
That drums are spot on!
Sorry! But this is very boring! =/
Love it but miss the OG shit
is anybody else waiting for there to be a makeup tutorial on the makeup she's wearing with the black shirt? <3
im in love w this song i have so many feelings help
Different but I like it!! Still love Paramore. I have gone to their concert & her voice is just one of my favorites. End of story.
PLAYING GOD VIBES.
when you know that they have to update to still be popular but you don't really like it. sad times
first time listening: I love it second time: I love it even more.  498383 time: what? I still love it
I LOVE THIS
Better than Hard Times.
The fuck is this shit?!
So excited for the new album!
Fueled by ramen, the vevo for emo kids
I'M LIVING FOR THIS ERA
Not a fan of Hard Times, but I really like this one.
i hate to see every paramore music video because in a way it depresses me how beautiful Hayley is and that i will never meet her in person. oh god why?
I'm definitely loving this new album👌👌 love Paramore and that is never going to change, it doesn't matter if they're not playing rock it's still good, as always.💜
That bridge though.... Well sung!
Okay, I haven't stopped listening, you guys have me whipped.
What the hell is going on with this band??? This is not paramore ... :/
cant wait for the acoustic version of this! 👏👏👏
will the new album be on vinyl?
i prefer riot
She looks better each year. It may be different to what they used to do but it's cool too,tho
Christ if you think Paramore have changed for the worse go and listen to Linkin Park's new crap.
good song, weird ending.
I'm getting a garbage, Kylie minogue feel...I love it
Her highlight though ✨✨
old paramore please come back
Love this style video! It's own form of art! Reminds me of Wes Anderson films. :)
Is no one gonna comment on how cute those outfits are? The whole aesthetic??
um so I love Paramore for taking this direction.  WHAT A JAM
missery bussines make crush crush crush and Ignorance never come back, so thats what you get.                  .  .  Like
I love this so much❤️
Been a fan since the band's debut and honestly this is a nice evolution of the band. I love it!
I already know I'm going to love this Era
What's with the 80s pop shit?
Anyone else turn it up the first time watching when it zooms on Hayley?
where is their orange spirit?
Where's wally
Disloike cause I Haite it ;-;
She with blonde hair looks like Lady Gaga
the old paramore sound will always have a special place in my heart, but this new stuff is AWESOME!!
Typical shitty mainstream pop
AMAZING, AMAZING AND AMAZING <3!
When they change their style but still rock 💃

people who just play clash royale for fun don't understand emotion being coc....
omg barbarian is so smart
Wow. The prices are 1.09$ why Supercell ???????
Remember the good old days... when clash of clans was actually life...
barbarian idea is amazing
Im guessing it's going to be new missions
The barbarian has a brain better than albert intestine
the update is adding a second nighttime village on water!  I hope the boat doesn't take me to Boom Beach...
well, it seems like we can trade or pay a visit to other villages ( A DIFFERENT TYPE OF VISIT) or maybe we can drop messages to someone when we are visiting.  Not sure but similar to simcity..
there's a pig in boat XD
Iam not understand about boat..kindly tell me what is this..
This is hilarious to watch. I'm excited for the update.
barbari is smart
why do you have a broken boat at the shore?

Was that felly at 1:00?
REMY COMIN FOR THESE PEOPLE'S CAREERS
always here for ASAP Ferg!!
wack why they using Miami sound and call it east coast.  west coast biatch
Wait... that's Skeppy
"You need to woman up" best part.
Girl, nicki done dissed her on 5songs now remy where u been? lol keep up
This is like a 2017 version of a Busta Rhymes video, especially around 2:42
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN TURN YANG' MPELA LE !!!

I LOVE THIS SHIT
Reminds me of Britneys oops i did it again...
Ferg had Flatbush Zombie Rick Ross French Montana in the video. putting on for the east coast hard af

The Only Thing About Remy Ma She Sounds Like She Don't Have Flow While With The Beat But Her Versus Be Fire
remy just stands out I swear.!! song fire but the world stops when her verse comes on. #🔥🔥🔥track
Remy AND Nicki fan. Think both are great, but don't see Remy as being lyrically better. Nicki's had more complex bars, but in reality they're both dope at rapping.
Love the high key shade Remy is throwing at nicki😂with the long black hair, holding the bald cat..
asap ferg and riff raff need to make a song together
I can stand the rain
ayee flatbush
this got 90s vibe
With nicki would be better
why ferg dressed like shaolin fantastic
"You joe budden, u pump it up.." hahahaha
Ferg remind me of old school busta rhymes in this video
This might be the best orchestral performance of this piece I've ever heard. Well, it's certainly the one I've liked the most! The flute/clarinet hand off in the beginning of the second movement was seamless.
Also, when she finished, she first acknowledged her conductor, then the first violinist, and then she finally took her bows with the audience.  That was classy of her.
Some of the audience members clapped after the first movement.  Oops!
only lang lang s fans can disliked it
The best part for me 34:29
Absolutely breathtaking!
what a marvel! It makes me weep....
This performance is beyond description.Beautiful!  Fedorova stated that Trifonov was the genius of this new millennium. She is correct. This Rach piece when at the age of 14, made me fall in love with Sergei!
Christ, everyone is so *graceful*....
I am in love in so many ways on so many levels now....it grabs your heart and plays the rest on your soul.
Not the first time i've watched and listened to this superb Concerto. Sheer bliss!
While listening I am reading, during the first ten minutes I realized that a whole eternity have just passed, incredible!!!
Awesome Anna Fedorova
8:07 to 8:16, those few seconds remind me a lot of Space Dementia from Muse (2:34 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bNnekk2_Yk), which ironically has a lot of piano except in that moment ^^'
Nicky Minaj have 1M like.
GEOLOGY- The study of rach
The greatest youtube video of all time.
momentum seniheser headphones tho.
what a classic - shelby mustang or an MG 77
maravilloso
Utterly fabulous
well I could definitely give the girl playin the piano one
Brilliant +
i don't know true Technique or Rachmaninoff personally. however I do know my gut & my own emotional response. i cried with pure emotion throughout. these musicians are perfection personified to me. BRAVO!!!! NAT IN OZ
best one in youtube
respect I'm feeling goosebumps in all my body
35:28 MONSTER!
I'm about to watch this live at the Sydney opera house in about a month. I'm surprised my ticket only costs $50. I thought Live performances like these would cost much more
This is absolutely gorgeous. Wonderfully performed.
I don't have a word to sum the work and the performance. It is humbling to witness this greatness , such precision , such brilliance . Cudos !
beautiful hands
wow, fedorova is super sexy and a musical genius:)
AAAAAll BYYY MYSEeeeEEeeellfff.......      - -sorry
The whole thing is so amazing, but the movement starting at 20:00 is hauntingly beautiful like the musical heavens open up in Rachmaninoff's brain and he just channels God.
Did not think searching for a Hearthstone video (video game) would lead me to this cool shit. Excuse the pleb language for those that are of higher intellect.
really awesome! i lost my word ... how did she play like this?
it is ok, but too many notes make emotions kind of unnatural. I prefer Debussy.
this is the first time I listen to a female pianist play my favorite music all my life and this is one of the greatest pianists I have ever heard to perform Rachmaninoff...this is just perfect
What a marvellous age indeed! Don't forget the HD YouTube doing this for us ..
MMMMMM H8 IS THE ONE FOR MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
12,009,043 views? Moved on a bit since I was last here! Sounds as good as ever.
117 years later ... and there's nothing better than that!
Kind of addiction
Majority there's a lot of old people. Well I'm not even 25. I'd be here.
12,000,000 views!!!! Anna, I love YOU and your playing!!!!!
incredible!
Awesome Just Awesome performance :)
Kissin did it better
Ms. Fedorova plays with astonishing beauty and passion. Magnificent.
Yes composerinuk, I heartily agree with you We are in a privileged position to sit in our own homes and be treated to this sort of music Thanks to all involved not least to Anna.
I love to listen to this over and over. I never tire of it. Sooo beautiful!
The strings at the very start of the first movement, chills every time. Saw this performed by the Rotterdam Philharmonic on Saturday, breathtakingly beautiful.
Wonderful that YouTube offers us this! The pianists are DEFINITELY getting better looking! Brings tears to my eyes how her fingers nimbly and precisely glide across the keys!
By listening to Chopin and then Rachmaninoff concerto, you truly understand what is a more matured composition. Great performance!
Bravo...encore!
magnificent
Maravilloso...
ok I got to say, they did a very good job on this trailer
"windows 10 is the last operating system we will make"  "Fast and furious 7 is the last movie we make"  "Just one more bite"
Omg this is so cool but I don't have the money 😂😂
The video is lit
I'm ready for a nice deal on a used Microsoft Surface Pro 4 if anyone is selling ;)
Microsoft is the new Apple. Deal with it.
wannabe apple ......
ad not great, could have been better
The music is great! Are they going to make a decent laptop for real people after this one?
did the womam look cg to anyone else?
It's time for microsoft to "unapple" apple
This video has so many views beceause the song is awesome!
If there is no USB C this won't sell. That is absolutely bizarre
ammm i mean Microsoft not Windows xD
OMG 😍 This is the best LOOKING Laptops what i ever seen and i see a loot of Laptops till now xD i always love the Windows products
Is it just me who prefers the song than the actual laptop
Microsoft your out appleing apple right now. ( i know out appeling is not a word deal with it )
Well, can't you detach the monitor or what?
When you have to fix game mode or privacy settings but get confused and make a MacBook.
I' m the 200,000 subscriver
2017 No Thunderbolt 3 or usb type-c... seriously?
Sorry Microsoft I am a developer and I prefer 💻
Y'all are crying bc it's so expensive, but a macbook is the same or even more expensive and then no one cares lol
Help out here  http://www.gofundme.com/gmymfl
is there going to be a students programm for discounts?
yeees 7th Generation Intel Core. Is this just faster?
So pleasing to watch  wants me to buy the laptop real bad
"Okay since apple has their logo exactly in the middle of the back, lets do it too"  "Also, lets copy their keyboard style but just add some buttons that no one knows the function of"
Has just microsoft become the new apple? Well maybe not but surely they have got lessons from Steve Job's ideas about everything!!!
i prefer this one than the surface pro 4 😭😢
why does this feel so apple?
Cool. I am a apple fan, but i like windows too.
Where can I find this song? Giving me goosebumps! Oh yeah I guess the laptop is cool too. Probably overpriced af though.
*dat wool is going to suck in all that disgusting student daily fluids*  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The song is now available on iTunes!! You're the One I Want - Single by Stephanie Tarling https://itun.es/us/oHbFjb
so they make a laptop for everyone, but the price only lets the rich people try it. It's so confusing
love the old school Grease song..
Finally is a Copy from de Apple's... LOL
Wondering how strong the hinge is because the kick stand on Surface Pro 4 isn't strong enough at 135 degree angle, which I use for drawing stuffs.
where is the future? usb-c!!!!
so thin. may as well get 2 pieces of paper and write $1000 for 4GB of RAM.
Ladies and gentlemen, commodity fetishism at its finest...
It's not T H I C C
Apparently you can only use the edge browser on this. Seems odd that other browsers are locked
RIP Macbooks
JUST BUILD YOUR OWN PC.
Why do white girls hate Asian guys?
What's with the Grease cover?
i was sold on buying it until i found out the price...... yeah no thanks microsoft i'll stick to more affordable laptops
OMG! Microsoft is truly inspired by Apple. Interesting.
holy fk its fking awesome
I have this, but I got it 4 years ago from ASUS.
Not revolutionary in anyway. Looks like a fat uglier version of a MacBook.
For education. Lol yeah like my dads gonna spend £999...
No USB-C ports and it doesn't even flip over. Why would you buy this when there are much better 2-in-1 ultrabooks on the market?
A 13 inch MacBook Air is the same price and has more ports
so it's just a normal laptop then
I want this.... how much would it cost
Apple < Microsoftpenis
Loved the song
oh wow that is so awesome !!!
Apple is nothing but a crap Microsoft is going to overtake apple tech domination soon their stock value will definitely surpass apple in next 1-1.5 years
anyone who says apple is goiod is gay
What do surface products have against 16:9? Why are we slowly regressing all the way back to 4:3?
My PC was only $250 and it has more ram than this laptop
The greatest innovation so far by the surface laptop: comes with keyboard.;)
Tryna look like apple much? However must admit the visuals are great
If only these laptops were cheaper
A mac with a different OS.
the saddest part is that i cant afford it :(
This commercial looks fascinating, and the song... Mmm)))
Why mini-DP instead of Thunderbolt 3 -.-
that song is so catchy
Oh soooo it's a laptop again. Hey lets take this surface and put a thin keyboard on it that stays attached. Yeah we will call it.... A surface laptop.   Just another thing to hate windows 10 on.
This is the most satisfying video I ever seen
*Hey at least you lot don't disable comments lime some other pussified tech companies.*
Very very nice. However, the only problem is windows ...
APPLE CHANGED THERE LOGO
This commercial was so apple-esque, I really enjoyed it 👌🏼
I prefer the chick then the laptop, I wonder who she is since I saw her in the other commercial
Would LOVE to see a black version of this laptop

Are we just going to ignore the guy in the background at 1:35?
i feel so sorry for Logan
You shouldve put the fake car on the dash and he wouldve been like,"What's this?" And you say,"Your car. ?" That wouldve been so funny
Hahaha you are a savage😂😂😂😂😂😂
That's fucked up.
This isnt an april fools joke that is way to far
SAVAGE!!!!!!!!
how much was the lambo
I love the guitar in it. Music is good!
i loved its lyrics !! 😘😢😞😖😔😫
He's an amazing artist
If you call this pop you're crazy   It may not be a rap song but this has a good punkish rock feel to it and I actually enjoy this song
I like the new Machine Gun Kelly
I love his words .meaning  .inspiration and raw honesty love the new the old .the genuine that fallows s  his struggle dreams and reality   . there's always haters there's always lovers
before i go to sleep i listen to this song
Idgaf a true fan of his work will love this realizing he's doing what he loves in every way hey can. #lacethefuckup
not gonna lie, i was getting worried his sound was getting too 'popish' but this song has a 90's/00's feel and it fits him beautifully❤❤
I wish I could like this a million times!
I really love this song! Thank you for the good sound and music!
Damn MGK's got some mean vocals man!
hell of a great song, can listen to this on repeat. my only issue with this song is its not long enough. think about a third verse.
This sounds to me like a mid 2000s rock song... Who sounds like this? I don't remember their name!
it's different from his usual style, but it ain't bad
wow Kells exactly sing, and I love it 😍
Mainstream pop, anyone? Another loss.
ive been listening to this song for hours
this shit is on another level. big ups to MGK. You're definitely on another level now. fuck the haters, keep this sound bruh.
Sick of these "been a fan since you took your first shit mgk blah blah whatever else"  Just enjoy the song and leave a good feedback if you want. No one cares
fan since 2011💙 "change" or not. he still makes 🔥 music. #EST4life
Love the mix of hip hop and punk rock, it works beautifully
love it my man MGK keep it up been a supporter since day one😘😍
Best song ever
Fuck dude! Idk what you got goin on but this is the shit! Keep on keepin on! Keep it real as fuck!! Go ham on that shit!! Balls deep in that shit!!!! Est for life till I die! I love you MGk!!
i love mgk you should put thumb up on all of his songs
lol these are just singles you guys. Yall acting like Kells not bout to drop anymore hip hop bangers. this is a nice tune
Heard this live yesterday (first time live) and bruh it was great
This song isnt why i listen to MGK. I will be waiting for ya when u get back to ur roots. Get that paper now and then make a record for ur true fans. Lace up
he's been singing a lot lately....and I'm not complaining
Machine Gun Kelly is one of the only artists who consistently gets better with every album, no one can recreate gunners sound
I wish Kells was as popular as Drake. No not even I wish he was more popular. Kells totally deserves it he is way better and actually works at his stuff. he needs to be known more. #KellsIsBetter
I l9ve this song I don't care what any one is saying
he hasn't changed I'm pretty sure what he's been putting out lately speaks for itself....he got his heart broke.
OMFG i love it kells keep up 100 i love you bro keep up that positive attitude
already heared it like a 100 times and i still love it.
i´m in love with this song
😓when YouTube gives you a 30 second ad with no skip.
Different sound to this one, not bad. EST for life!
No complaints, it's good that he's growing but would've liked another verse
kells this is so lit keep it up man you inspire a lot of people I can go on and on but I got work bro, have a good day!
tell me why part of this song reminded me of "stacys mom" lol
he deserves a lot more recognition by the industry.. he sounds so good  and I'm not going to be a fan who picks at his versatility whether he's  doing hard core rap or POP music...
so what if he changed it doesnt mean u should give him crap about it. I mean what if u changed and people started talking about u like that how would u deal with it?
The punk rock presents is high in this song I love it rock and rap not corny pop rap
Such a different style from his stamp of approval mixtape I dig it
is it just me or this Song, remind you of another song? i cant remember exactly which song. but its just familiar.
New music “rollinthereefer” by HAZLEWXXD!! Produced, engineered, mixed, and mastered by HAZLEWXXD https://soundcloud.com/hazlewxxd/rollinthereefer
MGK is the best thing in music!! I've listed to him for 4-5 years now and never a bad song!! that's no F'N lie!!!
mgk is better the Eminem always and for ever
Anybody else hear Boulevard of Broken Dreams by Green Day?
Fuck the haters. MGK a superstar now. few hunda grand turned into Millions! He could do wtf he want, i still fuck wit mgk.
Different, but still good, man. Stoked for the album.
where can I download  it
This song is me favorite
Yo man people saying mgk changed but he was always like this! 😂 Weather Kells is rapping or signing he's a rock star 💯 mgk always had punk rock in em!
over a MILL in 4days kill it mgk. this song is fire if you dont like it no one cares
He'll ya nice damn song nice to have that green shit with it tho
Different but I like it.
I like this, it's different. Bruh you should do a punk song 😂🤘🏼
I like his new style it's fire 🔥why everyone complaining
we need an instrumental
Just listening this song for the 27 time. This is what i call eargasm. EST for life ✌️
You lot mad? MGK has always been different, he makes music with different genres! I think they call it talented now days 👊🏻
Double like! Make more like this please 🙏
i dont care.. those fuckin fare... last finding your fare.. love nuch mgk..
Is MGK singing in this? its great and im addicted to this song
He used to be a rapper, now his music sounds like one Direction's blending with paramore. 😡😷
I LUV YA MGK FOREVER AND ALWAYS <3 :)
It's different from what I am used to hearing but its awesome nevertheless...its refreshing to just hear his voice more than the music...
Need an official video of this song!! Please Kellz
This isn't him... 😕 I guess this is what people want.... it sucks.
Amazing! Love this!
thanks colson baker your music is inspiration
the song is better than I thought it would be. Not bad fella.
This is so late 90s and early 2000s!!!! I love it!
I probably count as 1k of the views on this already tbh
This seems like a trap.
Jaddisumba.

Have they considered taking an mrt to the next station
I stay in Yishun who says this is scary it's COZY and nice the river so pretty the sky shining, BUT FUCK THE KOREA
We need to build wall around Yishun and make Singapore great again!
What the F? XD

Love this movie for its entertainment value. 😁
Like my vid=Pro gamer Sub=good grades for up coming test

Yishun Aint this bad guys
News have stated that ever since that day, they until now still stuck in Yishun. Meanwhile, I'm still sleeping with the big Godzilla as I live in Yishun.
i live in yishun and i dont see anything weird about this "trailer" its just a normal day in yishun. i dont get it whats so weird
This would be a good movie

Never. Gonna watch this at night at 4'38am
this is legit dope
1:09 Killed me 😂😂😂

Do make that movie!! im gonna watch it
Quit exaggerating! You are legit making me feel scared.
Loved the Superman vs OPM when I first watched it but I didn't know it was a Singaporean channel! Awesome videos! And the MRT announcement at the end of the trailer was the perfect touch. 13/10 would watch
they cant get out as a wall was built there
hahaha this video created opposite ahmad ibrahim primary right😂i always go there buy food!the chiken green/yellow rice there quite good you guys got to try their food tho👍👍
Great acting skills and production!! You are fit to direct this movie!! I will for sure watch this 👍🏼😂😂🔥

there is a japanese movie similar to this where all the residents cannot stay out of the apartment past 12 am
the first part makes me intrigued to watch but the godzilla part...the alien part makes it look a little childish
https://carousell.com/shiny.sparks
Disclaimer: The retarded person featured from 1:09 to 1:16 is not me.
why is this so tru😂😂
The thing with the aliens abducting the cow, u guys took it too far. Nonetheless, everything seems great
Tmw you live in Yishun but your life is still uneventful ;-;
Yishun must be a real nightmare these days!
HAHAHAHA THE GODZILLA!!! Never expected it HAHAHA! Great job man!
i don't mean to be a badass but.           i live in yishun.
Hahaha I live in yishun and I've not seen half of these 😂

you know i used to stay in yishun goe about 9 years and that never happened to me before but i would totally watch this if it is real ps i moved out last year
why not Ang Mo Kio
omfg this is HILARIOUS
world war y  world war yishun coming to cinemas 1 Jan 2018
I LIKE HAHAHA
I live in Yishun......God damn it but none of this shit happens I've been living here for my entire life so believe me...none of this bullshit is real.
2017 already and people still believe in superstitious bullshit. If you live in Yishun and make no problems then your life is like anywhere in SG unless you like to find problem then its your fault.
The neighbour part happend to me and i live in Yishun
Tickets on sale now! And like if you agree that the part when the announcement about reaching to Yishun was a good touch :)
yishun where got scared lol, i live there nothing happen lol, but tbh i just saw two uncle fighting today hahaXD then the police come lul
i live at yishun and nothing like that ever happened
this is cluster fucked up
What about that part where the drivers never use their turn signals?
OMG I stay in Yishun
I'm  stay yishun mrt  in froon   but  if I can  ask  this  is  true
You guys don't need CGI, just go there to film all the real things :)  You'll be so very safe
BUILT THAT WALL!!!
when coming out
I also stay in Yishun, must ask me I will know what to do. Megaforce mode.
Yishun isnt as bad as it seems la guys.
This is so much better than the ABTM
Damn funny damn nice hope everyone in the movie are curse to death
I wonder how the jc is like
Atleast Daniel got a girlfriend! hahaah jk! #Warla #Danley :D

The fact that the Muse Hotel has a cover charge just to visit guests staying at the hotel is pretty sleazy. I've never heard of that. Ever.

didnt ben use echo echo to beat kevin levin in ultimate alien? like really easily??
Wow, my childhood just flashed before my eyes
I'm disappointed that my boy XLR8 was only an Honorable Mention, but Heatblast, I love him so much... MY CHILDHOOD! THE GOOD PART OF IT!!!
Lol blitzWOLFER WildMUTT Someone's got a doggy fetish 😏
No Chromastone???
Where is feed back
feedback is my fav
four arms was my favorite when I was younger
Atomix anyone?
Ironic how many of them are i  the first gen.  🤔
I thought swamp fire was the new manifestation of heat blast
oringinal was easily the best
Daimond head wasnt top 5 :/
Where's cannonball, spider monkey, humungousaur and the little grey guy
The Omniverse clips really take away from this video
this show was my shit
best video.
In my opinion number 1 is Ghost Freak .
Upgrade is by far my favorite! Ship!
Where in the HELL is Big Chill? Or even Lodestar?
Number 4 should be removed or put at number 10.
Do u know that future Ben is Ben 10.000
first 10 are the best aliens for me
been 10 is my favorite show ever
Ben 10: Awesome  Ben 10 Alien force: More awesome  Ben 10 ultimate alien: Super awesome  Ben 10 omniverse: What the fuck?
Thanks for making this video. I remember old days when I watch ben 10. Now ben 10 omniverse is boring
No I didn't agree with your list. Where is big chill, hugemangasour, Jet ray and all ultimate aliens???
He totally forgot to add goop and that bens favorite alien from ben 10 omniverse( whatever his name is )
You say you never want heatblast to chill out, but are you forgetting that one time Ben got a cold, and he became 'Chillblast'?
XLR8 is not on the list  im done
number 1 must be feedback
i want humamgazor and chill bill into the list now
Heatblast+wildvine= swampfire
THIS IS MY F***ING CHILDHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Upgrades the best
Four arms is 7? Do you even Ben 10 bro
where the hell was chromostone!!!!????
Kids today: "aren't there only ten?"
I'm sad that FeedBack didn't made it to the list.He was my favorite alien
Damn nostalgia I used to watch when I was 4,5 years old and the mummy guy is the only one I don't remember
back in the day Ben 10 was my shit
I knew heatblast would be #1 im a genius
No Rath?? WTF!?!?!
I missed the Ben ten series, I'm gonna start watching this again.
Wait. Atomix should've been there. On number 2 or 1.
wildmutt was always my favorite
I loved this show when I was younger. Now I'm in my tween years I have gotten into the show again
I know all of them😂
what abou the fact that heatblast turn to iceblast when he gets sick
Atomix should be in this list.
way big is definitely an ultra man ripoff
why is heat blast the COOLEST Ben 10 alien........ he is suppose to be the HOTTEST 😏
Top 10 Ben 10 aliens... if only there were still just 10 aliens...
The best kid's show to ever exist.
Alien X was the best! and Xlr8 was my favorate! AND ALL OF THEM ARE MY FAVORITE SO MUCH MEMORIESSS
I didn't thumbs up the video because I agreed with all their choices, I thumbs up because someone brought up the original Ben 10 series in 2017.
I hated swampfire. My favourites were stinkfly, wildmutt, XLerate, and grey matter. I love how creative and unique all the aliens are, it must be so much fun designing them.
Where the heck is feedback
What the fuck is this
always did love how waybig is basically just a huge homage to ultra man(pun entirely intended)
Sad thing Blitzwolf hardly made any appearances
How cant they have humungousaur on this
Wild vine should of replaced the mummy one, he even has Granada on his back.
fuck the reboot... just fuck it throw it away
heatblast vs swampfire
The crossover  with Generator Rex was just awesome. GR was also pretty good on its own
Even though that one series was bad, Feedback was accually a cool alien.
where the boi humongousaur
ultimate alien was and still is the best season with some of my favorite aliens
THERE ARE ONLY 10 FRIKIN ALIENS IN BEN 10 YOU DUMBASS!!!
Where's humongosaur in all this??
Love my dad, he was working beside me and said "Top 10 Ben 10 monsters? I wonder who didnt make the cut." XD when I said there where more than 10 aliens, he blamed Hollywood.
I think goop should have been in the honorable mentions or in the list bit that is just my opinion because he is my favorite in his arsenal
Have we all forgot about stinkfly?
I love Way Big and Swamp-Fire they were great to watch on TV.
Original Ben 10 was the best!
original Ben ten > current shitty version of Ben ten
Good top ten. My top favorite aliens would be  1.upgrade  2. Swampfire 3.goop 4.chromastone  5.grey matter 6. Wildmutt  7.big chill  8. Echo echo 9.spidermonkey  10. Four arms
fuck yeah.... heat blast!
better have big chill
can you make a video on top 10 worst cartoon reboots??|  aka ben omniverse
Aliens who should have been up there.                              Humongasaur,Big Chill,Jet Ray, Spider-Monkey, Goop,Chromastone,Cannonball, and Water Hazard
alien X should have been number 1
u kidding me..heat blast..really.   where is humangasour
come on now no grey matter? upchuck? like upchuck is the best and dont forget cannonbolt he was so funny omg lol
Wtf,Swampfire is basically Heatblast and the plant alien put together how he's not #1
What was this based off? Popularity? Power? Control? Iconic ness? Because before I say my pics I want to know.
Why was anyone okay with Ben just changing he names to some of his heroes in omniverse
wildmutt was my favorite alien

After the fight, Joshua said "Let's go champ", and made Shannon Briggs' YEAR. Amazing generosity.  Other athletes in Joshua's position would just be saying, "I'm going to Walt Disney World", or something like that.

Conor is coming to take all the belts! (An Irish tune is playing in the background.)
AJ is just too strong
lmao 0:22  "Joshua just smoked Klitschko, like a Monte Cristo"
klitsko's head popped up like an eggo waffle when joshua hit him with the uppercut. lolo
Beating an old man
klischko ain't no bitch tho
that uppercut seems like more than his payday !
I saw this on tv
Anthony Joshua makes boxing relevant again.
"I don't know how klitschko stayed up!" Probably that cocktail injected into his asscheek before the fight lol
That uppercut tho
wow from the brothers of groove phi groove that was the S
19-0 with 19 ko's? That's a 100% KO ratio. I guess his opponent go in expecting to be KO'd. Damn!
love the uppercut! glad to see Klit go down
Think about this for a moment..Anthony Joshua vs Mike Tyson both of them at their prime ...beast vs beast..strenght vs strength...warior vs warrior..
did they pay him more to lose it this fight? looks like he just give him punch his face to negro
Warm&#Fuzzy
Big deal! Still took this kid 11 rounds to KO an old man.
That upper cut reminds me of when Alexis Areguao landed a uppercut on Aaron Prior! Check those 2 fighting each other. Oh I apologize for miss-spelling their names.
Mauro Ranallo is the best...  EVER.  This was the fight that the HW division needed, and Mauro helped  cement its place in history with his excellent calls.
0:08 klitschko said "oh hell naw, fuck this"
shout out from long island klitschko much love great fight.
So a 27yr young guy beats on a 41yr old guy and that's exciting?
Who are these people?
I miss Mike Tyson fights
Neither one attempted a takedown
I'm just not keen on any man with a back tatt. Maybe, it can start in the front and wrap around a bit. But, a straight up back tatt...nahhhh.
Eye of the Tiger.
let's go champ
beast mode 100% IG::::yeayearichie::::
Big deal he bet an old man who dropped him Wilder is gonna him up outta here.
MAYWEATHER=MOST BORING BOXER OF ALL TIME.
Now we wait for Wilder to end his night.
that was scary. brain injury concusion. fight should have been stopped after first knock down. brain damage is bad for business. i want to see klitchko fight again..
I said it months ago. Anthony was going to win!!!
If WK was still in his 20s, he would knock AT the fuck out!!
Amazing fight! I haven't watched a lot of boxing lately cause MMA is more entertaining to me, but damn that was one of the best fights I have ever seen.
Mauro needs to calm the fuck down with the Mama Mia's
Klitchko is old.
For the good of boxing Klitschko needs to pass on the rematch and let him fight Deontay Wilder ASAP. A unified belt will be much easier to hype. And hype is something boxing desperately needs.
All the Roids in the wold couldnt help him then lol👍🏽
Sometimes you just need to quit. it's okay
McGregor>Maywether
The guy is like 17 years older Joshua blows
good ole uppercut
that head snap fuckkkk, that's sooo bad for your brain
Premature Stoppage for such a historical fight....Dude was blocking most the punches! Damn let the guy hit the canvas like the true warrior he is lol These bad stoppages are getting out of hand in big fights!
Klitschko, love him or hate him, he had a great run... Father time is is upon you, hang it up and enjoy the time with your kid/ kids...
he's so fine whew !!
if only the pacquiao mayweather fight was like this.....
Why so many butthurt comments of this man beating Klitschko? HAHAHAH. I know why....
First.. MAMA MIA! IT'S FRIGGIN MAURO!  Second, it's about time they overrated floozy got his behind straight up whooped.
00:04 I can't figure out how much of that was intentional head movement by Vlad and how much of it was him just being wobbly from getting rocked so bad lol
What's the age difference here?  Sheesh
Daaaaaaamn! You got knocked the fuck out.
haters stfu. enjoy the rise of Joshua
I never thought I'd see Klitschko lose I thought he'd just retire
Connor Mc would beat them both no problem.
Vitali should avenge his brother and slap this guy around
i like how the ref was giving Klitschko additional time inbetween brushing off his gloves, can you say rigged? this is why i hate boxing, anything for the refs and judges to make an extra dollar
Wladimir is old.  Why is this a such a shocking win?
This is devastating.Congratulation to the worlds champion
what is his old ass still doing fighting
Great fight by both men, Dang i didnt think aj would be that much bigger .. Made him look a bit small
Controversial statement.
Father time is and always be undefeated.
Never seen a decapitation in boxing before until I watched this fight😂
klitcho should've destroyed this nigglybear. How pathetic to lose to him in that fashion.
this Joshua dude is slow as fuck two waste man fighters
this I'm fighters trash he's so young compared to w.k like shit he would have done alot better ALOT BETTER sorry fighters nowadays
If this fight was 15 years ago it would of been real different 😂
Bomb squad is going down!
this is where klitcko passes rhe torch but maybe after the rematch. just let a.j. put fury away properly first. if he wants the real fight get with your boy SHANNON BRIGGS or BOBBY LASHLEY #LETSGOCHAMP ...
today's boxing is like wrestlemainia  maybe Kletchko can match the  undertaker next
Let's go champ!

thanks, good

Awesome job
thanks, good
wow, not scam!
These mexicans are realy realy dumb...  We dont want you in America, Back to your fuking country !
Chile is a poor shit country.
You're my hero.
Curb music?
wow, not scam!
Could never be built here, it's not ADA complient.
OH MY GODS!  oops, I mean OMG!  Signing away their lives?!  How many have died? The title is almost as lame as the stupid noise ("music").
yea nice views down in a canyon
bit of a misleading title to be fair... not really signing your life away, just saying your fit enough to do that much of a physical task.
They would have to pay me to climb that many steps just to get a view. Me + helicopter = Much easier.
Next . . . . the world's most psycho waterslide to get back down .
Go for it, people don't value their lives anyway.
if someone in the USA built this they would have to make it ADA compliant.  I would climb it if I could do it at my own pace
I will wait till they build an elevator....
How many stairs are there?
So, can a slinky work on a curved staircase?
Awesome and very unique tourist attraction
Waiting for a video about this thing falling over.....
A video of images. Wow.
dont get any lead paint chips in your mouth...lol.
I'm here thinking I'm going to see more the one thing in the video. The title should of said the stairs to heaven tourists attraction...
Knowing China's reputation for building and making things, no thanks. China is out to destroy the world with their shitty craftsmanship and disregard for human life and the environment.
Click bait - Nothing dangerous about a staircase..
People visiting China should also be required to sign a waiver anytime they use an elevator or escalator, too.
NOPE NOPE NOPE
china has a lot of good, weird, and crazy fun things going on rather than just plain dirty politics like in USA....
Yeh,,,err...Fuck off. And when you get there, fuck off from there too. Then fuck off some more. Keep fucking off until you get back here...Then fuck off again.
fuck this shit I'm out

You could name her Suzie! Sezzy & Suzie would be so cute! Love the new car & love project comeback. I'm on it too, and finals week makes it totally different! xoxo
What is that song you have playing when you & Kurt are shopping? :D
great mom..
I hate singers on this show. There are so many singing shows! I thought this show was Manet for unique talents
she is really good at singing
I can marry her in any church😂
it's very moving when you can watch a mother go up there and sing so wonderfully it was a moving performance Bravo🤗😎
Her voice reminds me of Kimberley Rivera...
I don't really know why they stoped her
whats the title of the song?
Does Simon know what he's doing or what!?
that daughter looks like the sweetest daughter you can have :0
its like watching an angel sing
omg am damn emotional ☹☹☹ ur not just having a pretty face and ur voice as well. oh and ur daughter very pretty too!
She is a great singer, I dont know why she tries going so deep sometimes, her voice is not suited for it
This made me cry with happiness when she cried😭 But her voice was like an angel
so what was i supposed to see? some one butcher a beautiful song with a voice in the wrong key?
How does Simon know what song to sing.. Damn he's the best
WOW! You took my breath away! you have so much heart! God bless you.
I'm not gonna cry I'm a man ...... fuck I'm crying 😂😂😂
Set up. No way that Cowell stopped a quivering leaf like her midstream and get her to re-start. She's lovely, does not look anything like 31, has a nice voice, but this is made up stuff.
How is she near 31? omg i would bang
YES, YES YES and YES!!!!!!!!!!! she was amazing!
her daughter is the BEST!!
Holy shit my video just buffered and I thought she fully just stopped through the song lol
I was crying 😭
what the song title ?
She could be in a Disney movie, with that kind of singing style
The second song choice was more sincere, more real. It is like she was talking to one of her ex.
Someone poked me in the eye, it's just watering like crazy. 😢
am I the only one who cried?
NOOO SHE IS NOT 31 SHE IS 19
She was amazing !!!!!! Congrats!!!!!!!
THE BEST DAUGHTER.
Wait simon wears glasses????
They are so rude, she said she was afraid of someone saying she was bad at singing but he said "it was so happy jolly and horrible" like wtf she looks and sounds like an angel so really???
Love these fake ass set ups where Simon calls for a second song.
Who came into the comments because you got scared about her audition ?
i love her voice and she's is so beautifull
When I first saw her I thought she was 17 xD
Better than Rachael Wooding last year??
2:14.. so whatever u whisper to ur friend can be recorded?
I didn't like her.
Fuck you Simon but good job at the same time
I actually got tears listening to her, just beautiful.
shoulda go with celine dion
mother@daughter beautiful.GOD BLESS!!
Oh my gosh her child has a great taste in music her voice was beautiful
What avoice
I thought she was actually really good! Just my opinion...... Please please stop being mean to her judges!
I love her voice and personality
wrong song choice, but beautiful voice, she should have song and I Will Always Love You that would have been perfect for her voice
i cried :,)
The judges must have been deaf for the first one. I thought it was good
rainverx i was the 399 person to lile
A good example for her daughter! Good spirit..love it
2:14 (this video) 0:37 (Tokio Myers audition)  They can tell you are nervous. ;)
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A TRY NOT TO CRY CHALLENGE
When simon stopped her it looked like her kid said "Oh what now simon? 😑"
*BLOODY STAGED* ... this performance is definitely staged ..however the question is if she's staged ..like ... BGT payed her to apply or sth
SUBCRIBE US.
She had her hands in here pockets a lot
she looks 16
Why is my tears Fallin'? I hate the Fact that i miz Him that much😢😞😔
wtf simon she was perfect on the first song it was calm and gokd and his faget ass ruined it
Such a cute mom and daughter, bless them
HER DAUGTER REALLY!?!?!??!
This person was not good... she was AMAZING her voice was remarkable
I was skeptical that it was all staged till she lost it!
Simon wants her!
she has lovely voice.
When I watched the whole video, I was about to cry 😞
lol Simon looks so weird in those glasses
I didn't think she was good at all very aveage
That was awesome
🍀🍀First 200 people to like this will get good luck for a 10 years🍀🍀

"Crates AND Barrels?!?..... BARRY!"   Kills me every time 😂
Me.,... Im sO hiGh on sUGar...,,,
is it a coincidence that Barry (RE) looks like Barry (GG)
I wouldn't mind being with Jill. Alone. Forever. With no one else (alive) around to hear us for miles..mmmm
Barry: I have this. 😧🔫
I was hoping someone would do this! THANK YOU!!!!!!!
This was incredible, so smooth and beautiful
I love the little crayon drawing!!!
Mike always kills it. Super appealing character design and animation. Great job man!! :D
i love how he combined the 2 barrys
too many comments about adorable kitten face jill
My idea of how they would have food would make people look at me in a whole different way
CRATES AND BARRELS!
Crates AND barrels!   BARRY! There must be candles around her somewhere!
Grumps Jill is Kawaii.
this is my favorite Game Grumps animated so far. I can't get enough of it!
Hey i have a question. How do you get these animations on the main channel?
If there's ever a Game Grumps Animated for Breath of the Wild, I really hope Dan is the Shieka Slate
Do not kill yourself and do not kill others, either.
actually it's *knives
Anyone notice the cylinder in all the revolvers (including Barrys at one point) are backwards
is this the 5000th video on Game grumps?
The art style is almost perfect for this.
" I KNOW HOW TO BOIL KNIFES!!" GREATEST sentence ever recorded
Crate video
Fuck, man do I love some Mike Bedsole.
god i'd fuck her!
Alright just finished specter knight so let me just scroll dow-HOLD UP this video gotta see that kitty face knife again.
BARRY!! I found a create :D
Jill stop yelling
So FUCKING CUTE
I was waiting to hear a gunshot at the end
I would have pulled the trigger.
Apparently Jill is from Animal Crossing now.
*BARREH* THERES WATER NEAR THE CRATES!
I wish barry cosplayed as barry
honestly this Jill is so adorable.
OuO...........BARRAY
does this remind anybody of City of Ember? (the book, i mean, the movie was shit)
Nice animation but the subject was really bad not much comedy in this one But you did a great job with the animation!
She's fucking adorable
Barry: *END ME*    Also as a note,Jills knife is layered incorrectly
Congrats on 5,000 videos grumps! :)
Barry looks so much like Grumps Barry.  Great animation btw
This animation is the fucking cutest thing I've seen. I give it a perfect 5/7
I don't see why this is animated
0:45 BAREEHH
Jill is adorable
THAT PRETTY LADY MAKES ME GRIND MY MEAT BICYCLE THROUGH MY LIVER!
Crate & Barry...
Jill (Dan) knows how to boil knives. And also simultaneously look adorable. :3
I love this one I have watched it ten times in a row now
You need to dedicate a series to this... I totally love this.
hey guys big fan..keep up the amazing work..oh and OMG CRATES AND BARRELS BARRY..OMG
This is probably the best GGA in a while 🤣🤣🤣
What the fuck is the point of all the annoying laughs in the background
0:42 0.5 Speed... it good...
I love the idea of Jill Valentine being an easily distracted ditz. I don't know why. Imagine why she's shooting the zombies. "Tag, you're it!" It'd be hilarious.
We get this, but the Zognoids haven't been animated yet?
This gives me Flapjacks vibes
Zomg when she has the knife in her! So cute!!!
im boxed on if this is funny or not
I kinda like that Jill cat pose you got there...
Why are my captions suddenly on... and actually working correctly?
This is so cute
Can we all just folow this guy on every social media and enjoy everything he does so? He deserves as much. This style should be a cartoon. COME ON! :D
This video was Crate! Barrel of laughs it was!
Holy christ this is adorable
Barry and Barry look suspiciously similar
Sry but I'm still waiting for papermario
This animation is CUTE. AF.
oh no a zombie it must have heard us
Aw, Jill looks cute in this.
Commenting for YT algorithm!
Crates and barrels??? BAHREY!❤️
adorable and amazing
Haha, i like that character XD super optimistic about everything
The knife nibble was v cute.
Ten seconds in and I already love the effort put in the emotions. XD
This version of Jill is absurdly cute <3
STOP YELLING!! lol I love how hyped they made her sound about everything.
What episode is this from?
The booty song should be on every playlist
Dillon Francis is the best.
Dillon & Jacob <3
How did you miss the song CHAKARON ?????
How. Is. He. Fifty-two.
RIP Tim Wilson - that wasn't even his best or funniest song...y'all should check out "Ricky Tidwell's Mama" or "George"...Tim was a comedic genius
Tim Wilson is awesome.  It's comedy, so it doesn't make sense in this segment.
This needs to become a regular bit
Tim Wilson was a great comedian.  He was on the Bob and Tom Show on radio many times.
jimmy fallon how are you so bad at hosting wtf are these bits
that shade thrown on Dillon Francis
what the fuck is this shit? 2 guys sitting there listening to shitty music, genius comedy
Unfortunately I've been to through beaver lodge ' and saw Sidney. Thank fuck he didn't sing. He was working another job.
chris rock without the beard makes him look so young
Is it wrong that I kinda liked the dolphin song...
I've heard the booty song but I never imagined a guy like Tim Wilson singing it
Chris mad this so much better
The booty song is gonna win a grammy next year thanks to jimmy fallon
Maybe the Fluffy song could be created as a horror movie.
Am i the only person thats going to download that dolphin song?? and then go out and turn the fuck up!
I lost it at 2:09: from the one Reggae song to the techno dolphin- 🐬🐬🐬😂😂🤣😆
that last song though!! 😂😂😂😂
Sydney Castel, the fart of my people
i believe the "lick the chalice (spelling?)" is code for oral sex with a woman. Chalice and fallice (again spelling?) and that's why he's making the finger across the lips sound
Scary thing, the Beaver Lodge place, that's all real and close to where I live.
That Beaverlodge guy reminds me of Fred Armisen's Native American comedian character from SNL.
Jimmy's trying so hard to impress Chris that he can do the lip thingy. It's so funny!
I love That Tim Wilson song
How is he 52 years old?!
The Lick The Chalice song was apparently a huge hit in Jamaica back in 2012-2014. I looked it up. Mr. Pepper is a beast with that vocal effect.
Tim Wilson was on the Bob and Tom show a lot.  I remember listening to the show when they found out he died.  #RIPTIM
He looks the same as like 13 years ago!
This guy is still alive?  I guess Adam Sandler hasn't made a movie in a while...
who else is downloading that dolphin song?
I actually like the pepper song.
am I tone deaf for actually liking the boody song? :D
Guinney Pepper was fyah
free some thing https://plus.google.com/115746138310354181043/posts/aKDMUhJr3KZ
i can't believe the pukatawagan song made it on Jimmy Fallon. the song that plays almost EVERYDAY at our local radio station lmao. makes me wonder how the hell did he find this lol
You're funny man😅😅😅
That booty song? Now that's something I can get behind.
Dolphin on Wheels and Turkey on Wheels is too litty
LMAO "sounds like the dolphins on crack"
Most of the music they played are equivalent to today's garbage. All the popular songs sound more or less like the songs on this list with a tad bit more auto-tune.
that last song I am pretty sure got remixed at Bootie LA. and this is not a joke.
I wish Jimmy did this more often. Literally my favorite segment 😂
That dolphin song was lit...
I love Chis Rock! He's so funny, he just puts me in a good mood.
Chris Rock look like a black Steve O
the Manitoba singer omg I heard that song ALL the time, on the radio 😂😂😂  omg and here is Jimmy and Chris playing it 😂😂
"Wooow.. what part of Jamaica is he from?" 😂😂😂😂
guinney sounds like he got caught sucking dick in the studio
Kill the noise and Dillion 💪🏽
They should play 7th element from VITAS on this segment!
I bet these songs are from Jimmy's personal collection. He even knew the lyrics to reggae song
That's a hit! Haha, that got me.
If anyone is ever watched a crack video they have heard of the booty song
I fuck with the booty song tho. It's got a nice bounce to it.
I thought he was talking about gloria the hippo lmao
Ahh the booty song a classic :'))
That song wasn't Fluffy , that song was D-9
hi person that is going through the comments and watching the video
I remember the booty song.  My hometown radio station would play it all the time and it would piss my little brother off.
Chris should do a movie with Kevin Heart
I don't  why but everytime I see Chris Rock, I have the donkey from Shrek in mind, even though I know Eddie Murphy synchronizes hin
Kill the Noise x Dillon Francis :O
I LOVE Fluffy! Never laughed so hard!
I do like dolphins on wheels. Best song in human history
*I want the booty*
That wasn't live at my lodge. That drunken chug is a god damn liar. He needs to stop harassing people outside of the mts centre for darts and go back to his shit hole rez. Piss
Tim Wilson is Sir Mix-a-lot of white people. It aint that bad
Darn! Sorry Chris I guess our "List" plans are cancelled... Jimmy told me not to play with you :/
OMG I live near Pukatawagon, and our local radio station played this song from Sidney Castel everyday!!! Way to funny, he's laughing in heaven now, knowing he made it big. 😂😂😂😂
Honestly how is Chris Rock aging backwards? What skincare is he using, because he looks 15!
i did know about the booty song haha
Can I download Tim Wilson's album on itunes.
Keeping with Leno Tonight Show tradition, Fallon decides to steal one of David Letterman's old bits (Dave's Record Collection)
Lol the last song killed me
I just keep picturing Marty from the Madagascar movies sitting there reacting to all that. XD
that dolphin song was awesome
Rock of crisis
i wonder if there is any music ever that can beat the goodbye song by D4NNY
should've played rickyxans remix of dolphin on wheels
I've heard Tim Wilson's song before. Idk where but I've heard it multiple times. Probably a vine or something. It was used for a joke or a skit.
all I heard was booty ..😂😂😂
Why put a $5 piece of plastic junk on a $800 phone? Using the s8 without a case is such a good experience. The hardware is excellent and durable.
what do you expect? it's outer shell is nearly all a glass frame!
There are people dying of hunger and we are dropping phones WTF?
should i buy a case for it?
This killed my heart
this is news?
3:08 OMG is that the LG G6 great quality???!!!! Thats what LG gets for coping the idea
Glass phones are stupid.  Hopefully this trend will die in a year or two.  Instead of glass, how bout high density, scratch resistant plastic that has clarity and touch capabilities of glass????  Wait......
the back glass is gg4 and the front is gg5 thats why
This is torture
how color has this Phone?
Apple head, HTC lover, LG closet fan no matter what U say none can come close to the S8! Hands down the best phone out today!! Like it or not its true!!!
She looks adorable.
is she pregnant? can we have a baby drop test?
dropped mine the day I got it and it's back glass broke on very first drop on very first day
Hey cnet thanks for the review it help me out with my purchase.   keep it up
Just don't drop it or let it fall.
cover the weak back with a dbrand so it covers it and holds it in place and don't worry about it.
the back has thinner glass
it needs harambe glass
let's see your crack 🤣
Good test.. Thank you..
They should come with a free case
bad design the back, love mine but yes  not good. So basically drop it break it. 300qhid to fix the back
Give the phone away
couldn't you find anyone other than a poor pregnant woman to host the video?!
The phone in the car skit was an LG G6, not a Galaxy S8.
Worse than those infomercials
Buy a case. End of story
I am not the FATHER!
Most of the comments are: Is she pregnant? Of course she is.
why would u even 2 that 2 such a nice phone grrr
Remember those nokia days when phones used to be unbreakable
2 years no damage, so I cancelled insurance. Week after cancelling insurance, drop my S6 Edge (with bumper case) and lands on corner of tile: Cracked screen. Damage: € 329,-. 😣🔫
why a pregnant woman??
wtf my galaxy never cracks!  and i always see iphones cracked!
I've heard the glass back cover is cheap to replace
A pregnant lady but it's beautiful
don't break it give it to me
First thing that you do when you spend that much on a phone is buy a damn case and glass screen protector.
hey guys I been watch all types of s8 drop and it looks like the front is really strong but the back isn't and it cracks faster
Glass breaks you idiots. Put a damn case on it.
This video is triggering Samsung fanboys
ya i will be getting a good case for it
Whu do a drop test!?? This is so stupid!!! The damn phone is made of glass we all know it's gonna crack or break. No guessing here!!
why not use a stronger material? I'm more concerned with function than design anyway
but this is really good, all you need is a case
S8 strong in front and back bad
Lose some weight big belly ugly girl
That Gorilla Glass trash. I got the S8+ on Friday. It fell off my table maybe 3 feet on to my hardwood floor. mind you I have the commuter OtterBox in it and the screen still cracked. 😠😠😠😠😠😡😡😡
While glass phones look beautiful and they have Wireless charging.  I'm sure alot of people would trade in those things for more durability.
I don't feel like a genuine test...... Done something to Show to YouTube that i too done a test... 
Ok if people didn't learn from the S6 line to present being all Glass. You put a case on it people.
congrats on the baby Vanessa
this woman's an idiot unless she got that phone as part of her pay packet.
I tried watching this on my gs8 and I just couldn't
I think all drop tests should be performed drunk while flailing violently in an attempt to catch the phone. That is the most realistic drop scenario.
If youre dropping your phone, youre using it wrong.
Why is the back breaking but not the screen??
I cracked the front of my screen sitting down. the phone fell from my hoodie pocket and shattered next to the Bixby button. Shelling out $150 to replace it. 😂
thumbs down, bad testing procedures
gorilla glass 5? cracked at 1st test.. waste
Pure B.S.. I was getting out of the car and the phone was I my lap it has a case on it and screen protector and the screen suffered major cracking all throughout... this test is a crock!
every time the screen falls a part of me dies
After damage #1, all other tests are useless because you are the testing a "new" scenario with a broken phone... Need a new phone for each drop
is it just me or does she look good for a 40 years old?
most people who spend this kind of money on a phone will try not to drop it
dont break please give me
What is it about the word "glass" that is confusing you?
what kinda imbecile places coffee and phone on the car roof? AND THEN FORGETS ABOUT IT WHILE THEY DRIVE OFF???
Next time you guys plan to destroy a killer flagship for fun, try mailing me one first
I dropped mine in my room when it was dark and I just cringed for a couple seconds and  picked it up and my phone was fine but my screen protector fell off and got cracked to shit
If you drop your phone.....you sir are an idiot...dont' do it, take more care of ur stuff
hhhhhhhhhhhhhh

PLEASE PLAY DEERLORD AGAIN
Just curious, how has the youtube demonetization affected you guys?
I thought Wolverine was human until he got experimented on?
The legend 27 at the start and twice in the middle.
This may be a dumb question but could she asked "is he a president?" or does that violate rules?
Geo thinking bout Jamie Foxx 😂😂
TRENDING?! WOO GO JK!!
that was fun!
Who remembers the wonderbread challenge back in the day?!!! #TB
I need Julia in my life
Do more  Questions only & Mafia
Real husbands of Hollywood was Kevin harts show
Kevin Hart is not the biggest comedian right now, Its Dave Chapelle
Kevin Hart has been in alot of TvShows
Kevin Hart was in tv and on YouTube. They sabatoged you lol.
Geo's question #11 he has a tv show. Real husbands on Hollywood.
Game of Thrones is not based on earth js
Game of Thrones is not based on earth js
Julia is duh BAE<3
why did they say Wolverine was "never human"? He used to be human before he was mutant.
Humans are animals you dumb stupid IDIOTIC... jk dont care
20:40 *bart gives it away*
Actually Kevin hart did star in a TV sitcom show
THIS WAS FUN TO WATCH WOULD LOVE TO SEE YALL PLAY IT AGAIN
Josh is so fucking stupid!
Joe had me cracking up this whole video.
keavin hart have a show
Kevin hart was a regular on wild n out
Kevin Hart has 2 tv shows lol
kevin hart has a tv show
So will we be getting mafia again soon? it's been nearly 2 months. I love that new format!
This is one of my favourite episodes. It's defo one of the funniest XD
tiff is cute asf
Even if they did say Kevin Hart has a show, Geo probably wouldn't have guessed it anyway lol Since Bart says she doesn't know much about comedians. So either way, it would've stayed the same.
9:00 Geo could easily see the name on here card. Especially in the light.
More of this game please love from Singapore!!!!! :)))
PETE SAMPRAS!!!!
Kevin heart has a show
Wolverine is definitely not human. That's the whole point of the movies, humans vs mutants. You guys fucked up xD
Play again please
They... they weren't sure if Wolverine is part of the x-men family? I have never been this umcomfortable.
kevin hart does have a tv show
JERENA WILLIAMS
I knew Joe was going to waste so many questions the moment everyone answered 'yes' to his action star question.
Hobo Joe is becoming more and more eccentric every day.
When kevin hart has his own show but they say he doesn't
Josh should be neutered like Varys, just for not watching Game of Thrones.  Joe & Bart can you please give Josh a week off his JK duties so he could spend it watching it ? lol
Josh is stupid what sense does this make "I like Lord of the Rings but I don't like Game of Thrones because it's too long" Josh Lord of the Rings is like a 4 hour motherfucking movie you got time.
Wow they ask a lot of dumb questions on this one Josh and Geo just keeps wasting questions...
Geo- Does he smoke a lot of weed?   He's not Dave Chapelle 😂
Kevin Hart has a comedic tv show called "Real Husbands of Hollywood"
"I'm Deadpool mofo!" Im dead lmao
I love how Josh didn't want to answer Julia questions like just answer don't be a sore loser.
I LOLed so hard when Josh whispered "kaleesiiiiiii"
Man, those pregnancy hormones must really be affecting Geo. She's so nice to Josh.
you guys should play this game more often, it's hilarious and I really enjoys it
yayayyay you're playing this again!! my voice was heard \o/
I actually prefer Once Upon A Time over Game Of Thrones.
There needs to be more of this
so funny! You guys should definitely bring back some Mafia game play w/ David!!
Kevin is on Real Husbands of Hollywood lolol
WHY DOES JULIA'S HAIR USE A DIFFERENT PHYSICS ENGINE COMPARED TO OTHERS
26:22 Joe's Impersonation was hilarious!
Guys, you see who edited this video right?  Always good to see him back.
Kevin Hart did a show and he had a Mixtape 😂😂😂😂
Loved this video! Play more of this guys :)
play again plz
JOHHHHHHHHHN SNOWWWWWWWWWWW
You guys really need to play Fluxx. That would be fun to watch.
Do more mafia plz
I'd love to see more ultimate werewolf!!

When Joe guess the cowboy he was actually saying deadpool but he coverline :P

"What's up guys, Lew Here, Back with another Video"... That was the signature voice of +Unbox_Therapy. You will never know how much i love to here the line and i badly miss it :'(
Iphone 8: does it suck?
This iPhone might prise the SE out of my palm.
Honestly the only reason I still use Apple is because iOS is aesthetically pleasing to me, android is so ugly to me
The moment Apple puts a 3D Depth Sensor in the iPhone, every single OEM will follow suite and throw these bad boys in their flagship smartphones. Meaning, mixed reality and virtual reality for all. So pumped!
when iphone 7 release Me: wow what a phone Now iphone 8 leaked i am just like fucken copy cat
And the Apple home v2 is coming soon too! Its almost like they're not dick-riding each other ooooh wait
5:13, God damn US ruler is complicated at the beginning :)
so basically another rip off of Samsung then will be called the greatest of all times smh lmmfao. Apple phones are used by sheep's and idiot's, those who doesn't like to use they're brains.
i dnt know y people dislke this video.. good job LEW , thast y i like ur chanel most
i have a feeling that apple will be going with just a 7s/7s+ its not like apple to do a change like this
First minute is just him talking about useless shit.  Go to 1:36 to cut to the chase.
I suspect the next iPhone will be named the iPhone X due to the 10 year anniversary
iPhone 10 no fking buttons at all😑
And maybe this smarthphone will be 1200€ .....
heights of awesomeness :) :) unbox therapy is always the best...love all your videos
Not buying iphone/upgrading until the device includes wireless charging.
I use android why the feck i get sent here bullshit
So they are gonna skip the iPhone 7s?
I like that they copied the S8
radical shift 😒 THE SAME FUCKING SHIT as before
price: way too much
Start rapping 😂😂
Apple doesn't bring back the headphone jack I'm never buying an iPhone again. The Samsung galaxy S8 does everything the iPhone 7 does better but it's not courageous enough.
the iphone 8 will look so ugly the S8 looks much better
With all this glass talk... i'm not a clumsy person but i am going to be very afraid of dropping this thing... Apple Care is definitely going to be the way to go do this...
Like the iphone 7s?
iPhone 9: a brick of glass No headphone jack No home button No camera No flashlight  No charger  Just glass  I miss Steve
This is so inaccurate I got my family laughing at you.
I hope they wont use this iphone 6 design again its just so boring to such a round design over and over again
I think  Iphone will provide a much more mah battery to the new Iphone...& it would be a drastic change...i like the concept of the whole screen and the hidden things on the display.... Thanks for the update
I can't wait to feel it!!!
Its Iphone X
What about the front camera ?? ... Will it be under the screen .. if yes then ..how is it fucking possible bro !!
S8....  LOL!
So, how to take a selfie with that shit?
Sadly, this 3D printed model has a much better price-performance ratio than the actual iPhone 8.
I hope they finally get rid of that horrible camara hump though. But still nice if it will become like this! I doubt it though.
Are you giving away that iPhone mockup?:)
The 8 will have wired charging 😂
So excited over a non existent 'iPhone 8' 👊
Cool review. Taking the extra steps to print out a mock up. Putting technology to good use.
the CC is in Korean
I sure hope it has a great battery to have a screen like that. would be a shame if because of the screen the phone becomes a laptop.
By the looks of things, the next iPhone might come with NO display. That's something they'll call...'Daring'. And the iSheep crowd will flock to buy it.
the screen length
How are you gonna take a screenshot without a homebutten?
Yes yes yes lew,this is exactly what I signed for in your channel,i personally hate the next position of the camera 📷...but anyway please keep us updated like always
Next thing you know is the whole back part of the iphone will be covered with cameras
I seriously donot want an iPhone 8 after seein that ugly grey mock up :/
apple copying samsung funny joke
Pre soon it'll be a sheet of glass
phone ain't  even out and he's already hyping the fuck out it.
I cant wait!!!!
Smartphone wars are so fucking stupid, and anyone who contributes is a moron who thinks their opinion actually matters.
Can you do that for Google pixel 2 too?
hey leu, technical guruji has this iphone for real go and check out his channel
galaxy s8 sucks iphone 8 sucks. just get galaxy note 7 :D. best for self defence. just throw it to peoplw and becomes a bomb
once iphone8s comes out. i want to see galaxy s8 and iphone 8s and see who is more durable. i think the galaxy s8 will be more durable
It's beautiful!
iPhone 8 is gonna be a major flop. Worse than iPhone6 bending capabilities.
Nothing about it fascinates me. Even the S8 was boring garbage.  Best phone I've ever used was the Nokia Lumia 930.
All iPhones suck if your a video gamer buy a iPad instead guys
Bull shit, Apple would never do this change IN iPhone 8, don't believe me just watch!
I like your videos with five phones. :)
Where is the front facing camera? Speakers? Ambient light sensor?
I'm not into smart phones but the whole screen thing isn't that exactly what Samsung did, so apple has just copied Samsung
great video, it was helpful how you compared the sizes of both iphones
does it suck?
Only experts can tell difference between iPhones. Same was with commies and LADA car, "it's new car you see here this VAZ 2... "  2101, is iphone car.
Omg!!!!!!! no way this is new technology and ground breaker!!! iPhone finally catching up to Samsung.
You mean iPhone 7S get it right
if I get 100 likes, I will destroy an iphone 8 with a dragon dildo.
lewis sounding allot like vsauce
The iPhone 8 vertical camera looks soooo bad!!
now apple is copying samsung
all I see is a s8+ copy in this video
Still prefer you talk about a final product and how good/bad it is.
I hope it's better than Cars 2
AT 0:52 THATS NOT MCQUEEN!!!
i got so hyped when Chicks appeared
As a storm the lightning always is faster
So far,Cars is kind of the best cartoon movie for me lol
does lightning have a car insurance or a life insurance ?
Cars is my favorite movie and cars 2 by looking at this trailer it's going to be lit
Furious 9 looks great

Chick is storms trainer
*Guys unload the top site with free games* *----**>>>>> **#csgobessplatno2017** <-**------------* *Put like where it works*
This movie is gonna be like the 2016 elections.The blue Storm has a 95%  chance of winning but red lightning will actually win in the end to  everybody's  surprise.
McQueen is still quite good for a rusty V8 compared to an electrical powered futuristic car.
Hey, that's a nice trailer, too bad I'm gonna have to kick your butt.
It's 95% because what's lightnings number?
When is it gonna be released. The movie.
Subscribe to me
Everyone hears the storm but sees the lightning
Storm uses hacks LOL
This is like skilled user vs paid user
My 10 year old self wasn't prepared for this 11 years ago but I'm 21 now so i think I'm good.

Plot Twist: Lightning McQueen Will Gain All The Speed That All The "Cars" Who Competed With Him
I am starting to think that do these cars had birth or there made in the movie
Storm got lucky because he was born as a Lamborghini
3:15 the wheels are spinning the wrong way lol
Storm is a Lamborghini.          Mc Queen  is a Mustang he needs to be a Bugatti. 
I've never gotten chills from a Pixal trailer before. Why am I so hyped for this.
I am confused. Why is Storm so much faster than Mc queen? Why is everybody saying that mc queen should retire?
Oh no chick is in the movie!
Is is his lol
BRUH is racing days are coming to a end well my childhood is coming to a end!
When there is a storm, there is lightning.
When the lightning strikes that's the end of the storm
When the little car screamed lighting I cried because it sounded like a my little brother. #deeep
It's just al the trailers mixed together

Hello Carolyn, fellow retired LEO. Don't mess with us retired law officers. Be blessed my friend. By the way I love your videos.
Very interesting. Glad you have all your bases covered 👍🏻🚐
Great video. Thanks for the details you share. I expect to move into a van next year. It's very helpful to watch your videos.
Hi Carolyn, you mentioned carrying/possessing a firearm. How do you handle the problem of illegality in the some of the states you pass thru? Thank you for the great videos! It's such a pleasure to follow you!
thank you for your service to your community .. G-D speed ,,
Tip them truckers when they fill up they get two free shower cards hit one up I use to give one of mine away all the time.
who is this Bob boy she talking of.
Video been done 1,000 times by van, RV roadsters. Wear your short shorts it's boner material.
Great videos. Answering a lot of unknown questions I have
So unsafe why do people live in a van? they need meds!
What do you do if you get sick and have to go to the hospital and or doctor? Who would take care of your pet ?
I think you wore out your welcome in Cottonwood. You gals have been there awhile. Your neighbor in Ehrenberg.
Great info, thanks.
Great video. Thank you! *waves from Seattle*
What doctor prescribes your medicine?
I like you videos very much Carolyn!
Carolyn would you mind sharing with us your monthly expenses?
Where were you when you had prowlers? Stealth in a city? Boondocking somewhere? What did you do? Thanks
Do you experience a lot of mosquitoes/bugs? Would I need to spray around my campsite?
Good info as always.  Look forward to seeing you when you get back up this way.
can you talk more about the 2 prowler incidents. ..most you tubers say this stuff doesn't happen so I really appreciate your honesty...glad you're safe. 💜💜💜
Thank you Carolyn! Great Q&A for the newbies!  🐮🤠😍
Puyallup here! :)
Very helpful info. Thanks for sharing it :D
Good info thanks
Hi Carolyn! I recently subbed to your channel after seeing Bob interview you. I was wondering if you ever had a problem with snakes or wild animals. Thank you for sharing your van life!
Good  advice Carolyn, to the point.
I didn't know you are a retired cop! That's awesome! Stay safe! Love your videos!
i don't think you should advertise with your sticker.  it lets people know who's in the van.  love your videos!
I'm interested in the construction of your bed. I apologize if you have already covered it in a previous video.
Thank you for a very good presentation.  I just subscribed.
Stay safe out there my friend
I always have a gun with me. It's really nice to have that peace of mind!   good video Carolyn
Great video - always love your videos - hope someday you make it to Wisconsin - can stay at my house.....
You just make it look so awesome.  Im like, I WANNA BE DOING THAT!  I have my van ready and packed waiting for my husband to say lets get the hell outta here!  Sigh.  One day.  🙏
I want you to know you're helping me prepare! I'm recently diagnosed as permanently disabled at 40 (was in nursing 20 years). Was so concerned about the medications. Thank you!!!
No doubt I would rather be sipping on a glass of wine in the desert!  😊
Short, sweet and to the point ... the info, too. Thanks.
So do you have a nickname for your little friend(gun) like "Mamas little helper, Or peacemaker...Lucky Lu Bell...Or Gretchen...etc. ?
Hugs to you Carolyn. I too have autoimmune diseases and I will be full timing once I sell my house, so thank you for forthcoming about your challenges for it assured me it could be done. 😊
Nice video Carolyn.... love all the information thank you!
Lots of good information for us newbies to your channel.  How do you keep cool in the heat?
wow, $12   , I am flabbergasted..........
I remember your early videos...you seemed like a lost puppy...and look at you now.... a boondocking Guru!
Good info. Thanks 🙂
I do have one question. How do I get one of your stickers?
Hi Carolyn. This is an awesome vid. I can't wait til you get back to the Seattle area. Safe travels!!
Good luck and happy camping from a ole retired Sheriff.
Love the info about the solar powered security lights. Do you recommend a specific brand?
Thx for showing your shower. Good video.
Good Day. Another great helpful video.
I liked your very short shower video, it was great.
great info , also your bob wells interview just came out ..... lol better late i guess, people love you dont change you super . Enjoy yourself
I have mg so I know what that's like.
Suggestion for future videos:  Try to not shoot into the sun.  It puts a glare across the scene.
I was wondering what that was on our van..I will need to get a few for my van. Thanks so much.
Great Video Carolyn you should do Q/A videos every so often God Bless Safe Travels 💕🚐🐈💃💕
you mentioned in your video that you had a couple of Prowlers. I'm so curious about what the situation was?
Well done informative video for those who do not know.
So, you have had a couple of issues that were intimidating? And like what?
Tank-top and shorts. I am curious about where you got your gun stashed!
Great info. I have gotten rid of lots of stuff. Nice to travel light. Thanks!
PS one more question.....how can people carry a gun over state lines? We are in Florida and if we go to AZ, how would that work with bringing our guns?
Oh, having those motion lights is a wonderful idea!
great video... Lots of information and just look at that hot sun beaming down, :D so lovely!
Wow! Really good info. Simple and straightforward. Thanks!
I've never seen the singer. I am surprised. looks like someone working at a cash for gold kiosk in a mall. not a bad thing, just unexpected.
I dont want this clip to end
wait..... wait... I'm coming in in a minute.....
so much respect for this band. the quality of their music has never wavered
Oh I get it it's a joke.
Keep the strings!
Oh. my. gosh. The "high anxiety" shirt that looks like the stranger things logo. I'm in LOVE 💙
Rice. Cakes.
Who else read the title as tiny dick concert?
harry pottery
A human being is so nasty but with a mustache
that was incredible
King krule on tiny desk concert ?
PRESSING ALT + J ON MY KEYBOARD HAS NEVER MADE SO MUCH SENSE!!!
The fact that my favourite band from highschool was used to introduce my favourite fictional character in a movie who is a high schooler blows my mind
Listening to this while I eat my rice krispies.
Godspeed You! Black Emperor when?
I really feel like the drummer is a bit tipsy...
FUCK YES FUCK
This is maybe my favorite Tiny Desk Concert so far.
They're so good!!! 😮
I love the Tiny Desk Concerts! They are so raw. You really get to  hear their true unfiltered musicianship. alt-j nailed it!
Holy fuck this is amazing. TARO!
Come to Ireland again pleeeeease! Jay & Trish are craving some tra la traaah ah la <3
put it in my butt, put it in my butt,... put it in my buttttt
This is great stuff!
UP PUT IT IN MY BUTT PUT IT IN MY BUTT UP PUT IT IN MY BUTT WITH EVERYTHING GOOD
way better than their last show on npr!!
you guys should get Michael Kiwanuka to do a tiny desk concert
will there be any competitions soon?
omg love these guys
I was expected the voice from glasses guy but blondy beardy surprised.
Joe Newman's T-shirt is my current mental state
Taro is really fuckin awesome live too, thank alt j for the music! great work! thanks
Hipster over 9000!
This is the proper way of listening to alt-j live, not at some concert with way too many people.
I didn't believe it to be true...the messiahs return!!!
Man there is no Taro without Gwil :(
Don't like them live, but I love CD's quality.
ALSO GOD BLESS YOU FOR GETTING ALT J!!!!
NEED THAT TEE SHIRT !!!!!
This band needs DIVERSITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
warm foothills warms my soul. chills! goosebumps! i love alt-j. thank you NPR <3
anyone know where i can possibly find the drummer's red logo northface tee?
It could be Worth it to have a version with only cello and violin :)
the whole performace was on point, just blow me away and the cute smile from Cello player Carol Anne too
5:47 mad keyboarding right there.
that cute cellist was happy to play with alt - j   <3 . <3
Woke up to this. What a joyness.
I want CARPOOLPARTY
My imaginary girlfriend exists!! Shes all the way to left; my lovely cellist. I dreamed a reality
women want to be understood. listen to the sound of their voice
that cello player is so beautiful too
NPR   Nationalist Public Radio  There is no liberal MSM in the US if they all operate on Capitalism, a conservative device...
This is one of the few bands that every time I listen to them, it's like the first time hearing music for the first time.
Honestly the closest I'll ever get to seeing them in concerts considering actually seeing them live is mad expensive
Wonder if that cello player would like to tesselate...
The string trio should've said "Hi" during the "Girls from the pool say hi" part
All I can think of is that video "how to make an alt-j song" 😂😂 who else
as real as it gets
in cold blood is probably on the same level as left hand free in quality and should eventually be just as popular if not more
How many groups have played a second time for the tiny desk concerts?
This version of Warm Foothills sounds like it was arranged by Andrew Bird and I love it.
Tiny desk NEEDS to have Birdtalker on!!!
Just here to tessellate
Taro alone is reason enough for a return visit, if you ask me
I swear if they ever host the Hics I will be in attendance
I have to say the strings add a beautifully tangible fullness.
put it in my butt put it up put it up in my butt
I forgot Alt -J was awesome and josh you're the best live audio engineer ever
Once i saw they did another Alt-J Tiny Desk concert I had to immediaely click. Aweome!
yay happy may day <3
Bravi, cazzo. --high anxiety--
Not gonna lie, this music is disappointing.
Haha the mess up at 15:00 was a great show of how they really just enjoy what they do
wow. warm foothills blew my mind. That's my favorite song from 'this is all yours' just beautiful
Oh I miss Gwill :/
This song is a haunting motherfucker!!! God I love this fkn head trip of a song.
New alt-J video?? Yes, please... :)
i cant believe people call this shit talent
sweet, another great altj npr session to play on repeat!
Needs more cowbell
Joe got so red when he missed that note during Taro.
NPR finally uploads something cool again
The lack of Gwil during Taro made me really sad
This, is the most beautiful treat to the start of my day. Thank you Alt-J and Thank you NPR <3 All my favourite songs too!! Blessed
I can hardly believe how much I used to like this band. Good to see people are digging this. The pretty singing wasn't enough to keep me awake.
Inspired ...hypnotic ..amazing
"And Dude as 'Dude'"
I hope this movie is just as great or better than the first! Also I hope Uma is Ursula's daughter and not Captain Hook's, even though she probably is. Also where IS Ursula's daughter anyway?
Am I the only one who likes China's acting? Like, that wink has me dead!
DUDE!!! ILYSM BAE!!!! MARRY ME!!!
so at the end, Mal turns out to be evil again how great
That wink at 0:57 !!!
I think I'm in love with Carlos
Anyone else notice the wobbly plastic swords? 🤦‍♂️ Looks like they got them from a cheap costume store
Carlos' face at 1:28 is so great
I like her hair blonde, and plus I can watch a million times until the movie doesn't come out yet lol
I never realize the isle of the lost was really big in the first movie I saw the isle it was smalltown
Can it be July 21st already? I need to see this
Why are people excited for this? Why are ADULTS excited for this? Why is this even being MADE?????
not happy....   BECAUSE ITS NOT OUT YET
What this is crazy harry took off he's hook
The movie comes out the day before my birthday!! This could be a birthday present from Disney!!
Hopefully there will be descendants 3
I can't wait till it's out in Australia and I love her blonde hair and purple ends ❤️🔥
Is thxis July 21 2017??
Wish it was on June 15 2017
I can't WAIT!!!!!!AHHHHHH
And Dude as dude?
So excited for the movie
I love dove Cameron especially her blonde hair and is that China
OH MY GHAAADDD!!!! Ben is part of the team now
I can't wait!!!!!!! 2 watch dis  Movie!!!!!!
Of coarse it's all about mal😑 just like in the last one
PLASTIC SURGERY.... CAN'T WE HAVE ANY NATURAL BEAUTY ANYMORE?
OMG! THE DOG IS SOO CUTE!
she was purple haired then blonde then purple again
this is interesting Hook's son isn't missing a hand he's holding the hook, you can his hand as plane as day right at 0:46
I think Evie is not fit into the T-shirt looks weird with blue hair I always wanted to say when descendants 1 came out
I like Mal's blonde hair with the purple tips, but I absolutely LOVE her purple hair 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I'M SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO(10000000000 Os later)OOOOOOOOO EXITED FOR DECENDANTS 2
The trailer looks super AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm not one to like Disney channel stuff but this trailer was good. Until they said that there rotten to the core.
uma is the daughter of??
I wonder why or how Mals hair is blonde
I died at DUDE AS DUDE Lol
i cant wait to see the new descdsants 2 im very exited
Mal's hair color at the beginning looks like wengie's hair like if you agree:)
This is a Stupid  idea to make A Movie TV show i don't know  What it is just to make a thing about Villans Kids Evil like what the heck come on AND ITS COUNTED AS DISNEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And this happens just when you thought they would really have a happily ever after after the first movie...
wow I love mals blond hair she looks fabulous I love what she did to her hair wow
I just wish they'll stop putting Ben as a side character and give him a more prominent role . He's like always the dude in distress
I think the acting has gotten better..
Okay but if Chyna is playing as Uma then who's gonna play Freddy?       Chyna IS the voice actress of Freddy after all.
Can't stop watching from 1:22 to 1:29.....
Mal has 3 hair styles in this movie  The blonde, simple purple ,and with the bangs. I hope this will be important 👏🏼
looks like a good film hope its not all singing and fighting at the same time catchy tunes so far. love the wardrobe and hair of all the characters the pirates is a MARVELOUS villains so what i can tell by the trailer
They already are making the script for Descendants 3 I know because I,m going to be on the new show Ravens Home And I saw a Descendants 3 on a billboard in the studio
I don't know if I will like the first or second one better
omg who's excited for this!!😆
i like the new style of mal and evie and i cant forget about ben and carlos
I am literally only excited for China.
I can't wait for the film, but I live in the UK so I will have to wait ti see if it comes out on DVD.
I like the pink Mal
i feel like the descendants movies are like a comeback for kenny ortega ever since HSM, don't you think? honestly, he's a legend! i can't wait for the movie to premiere the day after my birthday!❤️
did anyone else realize that 99 percent of the comments are about Mal's hair lol😍😍😍...... can't wait for this movie!
I didn't know she got bangs..
I was the son of Jafa years before this sellout.
this looks trash
I like how people are shipping Mal and Caption Hooks son when in real life Dove Cameron is dating him 😁
BEN BECAME A BAD GUY????!!!!
MAL HAS BLONDE HAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Did anyone know Mal's name means evil?
If anyone has gone to any of his concerts, comment on this and look at  my account and videos? If you guys want me 2 show u a video my uncle  made at Justin Beiber's concert, subscribe me please.
who else agrees mal is prettier than evie
If there is a descendants 3 I want to see mals dad :) he could come back and see if mal turned out evil and try and get her to be good but she gets her dad to be bad :)
Omg  this is so cool
Well from my knowledge of Disney movies this movie will end with mal winning and becoming good
here I am, almost 16, still this is the most exciting thing in my life atm
Anyone else LOVE the casting for all the roles except Uma? The "bad guy" looks like the most innocent, baby-faced, girl scout I have ever seen. Her "evil" face looks like a kitten trying really hard to be intimidating.
Why is Mal bald
I'm really excited to see this movie! Can't wait to see it in July
they need to learn to put things as powerful as the wand under better protection
It's time for the hate-filled Jews to be put back in their place.
CAN'T WAIT FOR WATCH DESCENDANTS!!!!

Our channel is now "TERMINATED" shows a picture of it saying "SUSPENDED" Either it’s on purpose for drama, or they are just that stupid.
Hey guys, I know how hard it is to gain subscribers and so to lose it all over night sucks a lot. I subbed, hope it gets fixed. :)
The bright side of this is that 10-14 business days later this will be solved and you'll have two channels to promote
Please upload some random videos so we can view it and give you money :D  We need to support you so please upload :D

Shoutout to h3h3 for ensuring this issue got into the public's eye
0:56 What kind of fucking spelling is that? Sorry but either ZM employs a 12 year old admin or it's an actual 12 year old trolling you.
you guys sounds boring as fuck, you will never be in the millions level
I bet these guys  send their money to terrorists
read the description.
How much do you want to be it's another one of those fucking YouTube heroes? Sounds like it.
Go get an education and get a job lol. Video sucked, sorry.
they asked via western union = typical scam. .
please stop being an obnoxious pile of shit and accept the fact that YouTube owns you nothing. go get money somewhere else...
What kind of videos did you all post/create before?
I've never heard of you guys before but this is pretty shitty. I'll give you a sub.
Jesus.... Youtube needs to get their shit together.
Hope everything is okay, you'll get your subs back in no time
you need to get law enforcement involved this sounds like blackmail.
Did you copy right your videos with the U.S. Copyright office?
Thats fucking wrong man, just greedy as fuck
This is bullstit. Youtube just cares about their advertising  masters.
Who cares camel fuckers.
That's just beyond scary....
Could you link us to your old youtube channel?
I Subscribed both your channels hope that will do any better.    You guys are awesome super funny .  Maybe it was the barakat of that lady singer i forgot her name.
GG get wrecked no one cares,   Go get a real job etc etc  What a joke, youtube has always been terrible, this is nothing new.   Money = Freedom.   Have more money get more freedom.
Quit crying you set of wet squads.

How long did it take to complete this? This is f@#$ing beautiful

Alright, that hurt my head but I absolutely loved it. Nice use of a small amount of basic rotoscoping (from what it looked like) but then flipping it on it's head. Excellent work.

Keep up with the reviews, bro! I like em a lot!
Lol this dude is a wannabe Adam Lz
Previous video was kinda "meh" compared to other ones. The "No Fucks Given" Miata is what got me to this channel and its pretty extreme, compared to another bagged E36 M3
dont park next to motorcycles like that fr
love your vids
hey tj hunt you should  rap your car red with orange !?
That ducks snap back is nasty.
TJ ,the GTR would look a lot better with black rims IMO
Since you like monster you should try the orange one and white one.
calvin looks like Ted Wong of video game high school
Sabrina is so good at the outros! It sounds like a female Tj.
Do a review of a old BMW 7series
Rent a garage, buy a lift, buy tools, pay someone to change an O2 censor... good job
Hey Tj you should plan a trip to Z1 motorsports here in Georgia one day! Would be cool meeting you up here, and you could pick up some cool stuff for the Z or Gtr.
i like your content now, not really a fan of the reviews
Play Protoss and have your partner or partners play a different race, then mind control their builders and have all 3 races.
blue with gold flake wrap??? =🔥🔥
Tj, make a table out of that old engine. Use a glass table top
bring back the clips after the outro!!!!!
dude, please put a protective transparent wrap on it, cuz the color is nice
show her how to hold it
The car wasn't to good (on the review) do more of them,the og's miss them
wrap it in a ruby red!!!! that would look sick af with those gold wheels n the black accents!!!
Where's that bike bro
Your click bait has gotten worse over the past two years . Kinda sad actually
when Sabrina acts like the gtr is her's
The Guls!?! Bro you better just bring your ass up to Anaheim and watch real men play hockey cmon now.
The motorcycle moves and you look like a dick....
So what I learned is to never ever order wheels from Avant Garde. I would cancel my order if I were you.
Reviews are great!!!!
TJ THE DAMN 2J IN THE BRZ DO IT DO IT DO IT.
Protection Film?
I didn't draw a dick on your car with my finger, but I did draw a finger on your car with my dick.  That's probably the reason why you're changing the color.
I'm in to reviews
GTRs sound like elephants when on WOT
No more car reviews
bro i think you should make a call to VOSSEN USA for the wheels for brz
I like the original paint. It was just to old wheels that came with it that made the car look bad.
clickbaiiiiit boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccccccd
TJ: "I've never unwrapped a car before." Didn't you unwrap the red off the BRZ before the blue?
to be honest I didn't even notice that video was yours. I figured it was just some random in my suggested videos.
Go get a sonic Iced coffee.. little sweet but REALLLL GOOD
5:07 1299 Paginale
Have a shop but no scanner. 40 bucks online smh
Please let the reviews coming.  We love them.
More car reviews thoo
Keep the reviews please!
you should take it to premium just in case if you ruined the parts where you didn't remove the wrap
I like the reviews keep making them TJ
Where that podcast at Tj?
I love the review especially because it was a BMW
TJ's BLINDED BY THE BJ's
Sabrina nailed it at the end :D
am I the only one that thinks Emily is cute af!?!😍😌
I don't understand why all of your cars have to bee bagged. Coil overs ride better and weigh less
Bro it's a 2J, it's already nice
no reviews to many people do that wack type of content
probably just haven't washed it
Go Reign Go
I just personally didn't care for watching a review on a bagged e36 m3 but i would watch others
Do phone covers for the Galaxy series
get a scanner bro...
you guys should get a PS4!
Damn man, I been saving for a wrap and rims for 2 months!! People on YOUUUUTUBE YOUUUUTUBE just do it when they wake up LMBAO! CRAZY!
You didn't do the Cinematic walk around on the e36. I feel like that's why you didn't get as many views bro
i feel you bruh ive unwrapped my car and my fingers were raw lol
Both Calvin and Sabrina's impressions of you Tj are spot on😂
Hey TJ, I know Jayztwocents just built a custom pc for Terry crews, you should talk to Jay about building a pc that matches one of your cars.
It's not so much that I didn't like the review, because the car was dope, but it got repetitive and I found myself tuning out around the mid point. Maybe shorten the reviews and do mini-episodes?
Both colours are good really!
what is the instagram name of Sabrina
You never should have wrapped it. So much better.
calvin. build a rig at the shop and stream there too lol
Leave the reviews to the og dude in blue
if you build a pc. consider buying playerunknowns battle grounds.
who you think the devils taking #1??? Patrick or Nico Hisher
I LIKE THE REVIEWS!
TJ made his gtr look like a wrx
calvin carry me in overwatch. cuong#1802
Dude I love the reviews I'm glad you did one again
Come to automotion Wisconsin Dells
Is he a Zerg bro bro
Now that you took the wrap off, you should do blue lug nuts on the wheels to go with the paint! That would really round out the design!
TJ The GTR  looks a lot better blue good to see you took the wrap off good video.
the e36 was lame. basically stock
Ok, so what's the best way to find RV parks? Do y'all have a "guide book" of RV parks in the US or do y'all just google to find them?
Great information, thanks!
Gotta admit, those Mormons got themselves a pretty nice state.
Do you ever sleep?????? Another awesome video!  You two amaze!
My favorites in that area are Zion and Arches......the others were spectacular, but those two just had views that were unbelievable.  Great reviews guys.
This is definitely one of your best videos!  Thanks for the great information and quality video.  Keep up the good work!!
Great video!  We like how you guys describe what amenities are (or are not) available. Good practical advice for planning a trip.
Do you guys have a patreon, or have you thought of patreon?
Great video guys! I've always loved Utah, since the first time my family went there in the late 70s.
Last Fall we had the chance to do a few days in southern Utah without the RV.  We loved it, especially Bryce.  I liked Bryce more than the Grand Canyon.
Another great video!  Southern Utah has been on my list of "must see" for several years now and you confirmed this for us.
How early should you make your reservations?  Thanks for the info.
I did that adventure back in the summer of 1988.. Zion was my favorite, Bryce was the least...Needless to say, Zion was not crowded at all, back then...  Thanks for taking me back... Thumbs up!
Too bad you didn't make it to Goblin Valley, it's awesome!
This was a super super super helpful video thank you so much I hope you guys do more of these in the future ! And you definitely need to check out goblin Valley !
Here's something to think about. Those carvings in the rock faces might be their version of youtube back then.
At Capital Reef, you can pick fresh fruit during the Fall.  It makes a great free snack while in the Park.
Don't forget Kodachrome State Park.  thanks
We love Utah!  Going back in July to bring our kids there for their fist time.  Goal is to hit all all of the Mighty 5.
Very informative. Thank you. Very well presented...✌
Beautiful! Hiking looks awesome there!
Thumbs up it's .Thanks
Thanks for the tips!  We're planning a trip to Utah this year.
You do a great job! Thanks for all great info!👍👍💫
We went 3rd weekend October to escape heat! Moab that is. It was perfect
you should chip your f 250
I don't think they are really price gouging as much as you think, the biggest problem in those areas are not as accessible and have a much higher cost of delivering goods.
Utah has a special beauty. I've been to Bryce. Now I need to set aside some time to see the others. Maybe in September after school starts.
Tropic has a small, but pretty good grocery store.  Prices weren't bad.  Basic food stuff.  I think the name of the place is "Clark's".  Good cafe there, too.
You two inspire my wife and I . We're are preparing to sell everything and go full time RVing . Thanks for the great and informative videos . God bless you both .
Enjoyed your video so much! As I type this I am in St George on business, wish I had time to visit Zion! BTW, as a side note, we local Utahns pronounce it "ZYE-un"!
Thank you so much for the video!! I've never been to Utah, but have always wanted to.
Great job guys going next year. Love your hat
Definitely on our places to go next fall on our first adventure to Utah!  Thanks the video was great!
Excellent video and advice!  Scenery is absolutely beautiful.  Keep up the great work - look forward to your upcoming videos!
We left in July and rode our Bikes( Harleys)  out to Monticelo, UT. From Ohio.  OMG ! Was it HOT ! We still really had a great time. Such a Beautiful Place.  We are gonna go again, In Our Coach this time...
Like just for talking about Utah! Did you guys see the Pioneer Register in Capitol Reef? It is on the way to the tank.
Great video! did the drone survive?
Moab definition;  Blue laws,  price gouging, and arrogance.  Too bad,  it is proof that there is a God.  The environment is breath talking.
Thank you for all the insights into this part of Utah.  Looking forward to seeing this part of our country and using your insights to help with our plans.
That was a very good video. Top 10 for you guys. Beautiful video footage. Wow, is what I have to say! Makes me want to load up and go there tomorrow.
...And I just ordered the Champion generator.  Thanks for the heads up on the price.
Amazing scenery, thanks for sharing your journey.
Great tips and information guys.  Just a heads up.  There is roadwork this summer on the road heading into Arches.  Arches may be off limits for the most part due to that roadwork.
Just think, we live here in the midst of it all! We see it all the time, but it never gets old.
One of your best, lots of information, Thanks!
great video. can't wait to go out there
To see these places in winter-snow covered would be incredible, but not for camping.
Great video a always. Go buy the champion generator. We love ours. cost us almost $400 more on sale last fall.
Its already getting to crowded, stop talking about it!
I just asked if you'd ever gone to Utah in your Discussion tab about a week ago.  You made my day with this vid.
Do you ever go to monument valley, ut ?
Great video guy's    🤙
Great video. I am counting the days until we go full time RVing. Utah was second on my list but after your video, it has moved to the first must see section. Cheers!
Can't wait to get there.  Great video.  Come to MD and visit Assateague Island.
Love Utah, lived there for 10 years!
You guys forgot about goblin park. that's a must see too just out of moab
This is a keeper. We're wanting to get to the canyon in September (maybe October) and wanting to do a few Utah canyons.
These places should be visited in Autumn or Spring for maximum enjoyment. 3.2% beer and don't dare ask for another drink until you've finished the first. 😊😊😊😊😊
Truly my favorite state next to Colorado! Haven't been to Alaska yet 😊😊😊😊😊
love your videos. I have lived here in Utah most oc my life. We love rving around our State. My favorite time to go to Zion is October.  Just one suggestion. We say it "zie-un".
What caused the drone to crash?
★★ Thanks for watching! Please leave a like if you enjoyed and tell me what you think in the comments!★★

You're so beautiful!!! This tutorial is Amazing but you rode it with the eyeliner😔 but still gorgeous❤
The new Wet n Wild foundation is so good. It makes you skin look so beautiful and natural. They don't have a bunch of shades, but it's still amazing.
I mix the good to glow in with my foundation and it gives that all over subtle glow. Helps you look awake when you are... not.
You should do a tutorial using only elf makeup!
How the he'll did I end up here!?? Nice vid though
Hi Shannon, I was wondering if you could do a makeup tutorial to match a navy blue formal dress. I have my formal in august and I have no ideas about my makeup. Thanks
who else wants to get their makeup done by shannon?
I saw those ears at Kmart at the plaza and I got some. I moved a few days ago to BOP but I used to live in Palmerston North.
The Essence mascaras are as good if not better than high end! I chose to use them over my Dior show mascara daily and they're only around $4 in Aus

Makeup revolution is my fave brand and there bronzers blushers and highlighters are amazing

nielsen? what about ja rule, he really was the genius in this!
"Nice beaver!"
There was only one time that Leslie was a comedic genius - HIS LIFE TIME. He was the ultimate comedian, period.
He really was the king of dead pan comedic delivery.
only 21? really
You have only touched the tip of the iceberg. Such a brilliant comedian. Such a great man!
I completely forgot He was in superhero movie.  And I really completely forgot Kevin hart was in superhero movie
Most of these jokes wouldn't be allowed nowadays in the current PC era. Fabulous jokes never see these anymore.
2:44  - who played mina!?!?    BOING
Thanks for posting, hilarious
Cigarette? Yes, I know!
who disliked this?leslie Nielsen is one of the first real spoof comedians along with Lloyd bridges,nobody even comes close to him,pure comedy genius
oh,so now your changing your story;,That whole questioning scene was genius.
I loved the freezeframe at the end of each police squad episode
Toss my channel a sub, and be entered in for a Giveaway! 50 subs is first Giveaway! Outlast 2 stream tonight Dewds! #tomcruise
who are you?and how did you get in? Im a locksmith and im a locksmith.
Don't call me Shirley!
"Lost my wife in a blimp accident at the Orange Bowl"  (Priscilla)  "GoodYear"  (Leslie) "No worst" After the death of my beloved wife of 22 years, I used to think of that exchange to not feel sorry for myself.
Stop the gays.
I think #5 is inspired by "Who's on first?"
Police Squad!
Leslie Nielsen and Mel Brooks together in one scene. Comedy royalty right there.
can someone list the names of these films?
i care for you just like your father did. love you like your father did. had sex with your mother like your father did 😂
Leslie Nielsen was never a comedic genius he was never funny or talented on any level.
"I've been pulling this thing up and down like a zipper."
Glad a lot of funny comedians are Canadian.
overrated, very dry humour,  a bit like dick van dork!
I had never seen that "who's on first" bit before, very funny.
That Mrs. Twice line was classic.
That lowrider scene nearly killed me... :D
He's not a comedian he's a real actor you jackass
Where is "Nothing to see here"?  To me that has to be the most classic moment of his.
I met Leslie Neilson when i was 4 years old. I remember it like yesterday.
police squad was the best!
jerry's kids my ass
Really, this is being genius? This acting is pretty normal, nothing outstanding. From your standards it might be enough to put someone in front of a camera to make it a genius.
his best role was tales from the crypt. He was good in kung fu aswell
" . . . we would've come earlier,  but your husband wasn't dead then".  Priceless stuff!
who is better leisle nelison or steve martin ?
The unflappable deadpan that he embodied was so classic. Airplane! and the first Naked Gun will always be my favorites.
I Love you Leslie! Thanks for the laughs! 😅
Like he wrote those gags...
Spoof movies haven't been the same since Leslie died
Was there a time he never looked old? lol
What movie was that at #10???
"I'm the locksmith...and I'm the locksmith." Brilliant writing!!
Thank you I needed that today. hilarious!
Was there really any doubt what #1 would be...?
Brilliant video. 👍
best was Bingo lmao
also what film was the knife one from, #18 i think, didn't regonise it
I loved this man and I miss him. He never failed to make me laugh.
who are you and how did you get in here? Im a locksmith and im a locksmith, cracked me up
Love this kind of Comedy. Thanks for posting.
His timing was perfect, and the seriousness of his comical sarcasm is what made him stand out. Sure miss this guy! R.I.p leslie Nielsen and George Kennedy!
don't call me sherly
the scene where the throws a towel at his face and he acts like its acid or something lol shower scene
Great post.Leslie was so funny growing up.i don't think we'll see comedy like this again. 👍🏽
He's not dead...sure...only a joke...a bad one.
How's it that Nielsen has ALWAYS been old?
# 22 the airbag scene in naked gun
WOAH WAIT JUST ONE GOD DAMN MINUET! Chris Heart and Leslie Nielsen made a movie and no one told me?
2nd favorite line, after the "beaver" one: (Frank Drebin approaches two officers, with female suspect) "Sergeants, take her and book her!" (He shakes each man's hand individually) "Sergeant Taker. Sergeant Booker."
Classic comedy Canadian style. Miss the guy
"Don't call me Shirley" - Comic Genius
L.N. - "Nice beaver ! " Woman-"Thank you I just had it stuffed"  L.N. - "let me help you with that " ,😅😅😅😅
He is pretty funny considering that he never used profanity
1:11 What the hell is she saying there?
The bit at 6:30 isn't as funny as "Who's on first".
Sadly missed.
"Nice beaver"
sex frank? uh.. not right now ed we got work to do..
Aw, man... Nothing from Due South?
What is the movie called where he played the vampire?
Now do Leslie Nielson's Too 10 dramatic moments
I remember years ago, I almost died watching "Naked Gun".  I don't get my breath when he was the umpire.
I dont know what exactly you'd call this brand of comedy buy gd it was hilarious. I remember watching police squad on TV it was hilarious, it got pulled because too many people were missing the jokes.
How could you not include the umpiring scene from the first naked gun, or any scene from Repossessed?!
Great upload thanks 👍  The "I'm a locksmith... and I'm a locksmith." kills me every time.
remember the fireworks factory blowing up with Frank turning to the crowd: " Nothing to see here! Nothing to see here!"
Dead and Loving it was great Renfield had some good line and parts too
I loved the Leslie Nielson movies, but let's not foget that it was the combined genius of Zucker Ambrams Zucker that brought those characters alive...
Really good video, great idea and all the pros and cons were clearly stated.
Clear iPhone next so you can see the missing headphone jack? :D Great vid been watching you since your Viper alarm installation video. Great to see you're so close to 1 million subs.
Love your videos Zack! Thanks for being a part of Youtube!
try OnePlus X cause it is also glass
dude, this video is orgasmic;)) very nice work
are you selling...
Have you pulled the color off an S7 Edge? Considering doing this to an Edge I have with a broken front screen.
Am I the only one who is in love with your voice?
do it samsung
Looks like shit
congratulation you really fucked up a s8
ONE PUUUUUUUNCH
Lovely video, always like when you do something original and explained CLEAR-ly (haha get it)
School dropouts do things like this only. LOL
Why would u do that 😭
hello mr.Jerry i want to see inside xiaomi mi6
why would you spend time doing something like that can't you go fly a kite,go jogging ,hunting ,fishing or something!!
it's worth noting that's no only lost wireless charging but also NFC and MST Wich means no wireless payments for this puppy anymore.
It's counter-innovative. I personally don't think the majority would find it attractive and would just go for solid colors instead if given the option.
Partially functional. You removed a function or 3.
he looks like agent 47
that is really nice looking. to bad you can't add some LEDs to it to make it really stand out lol. Taking it back old school.
very nice mod!
can u make a video of that for s7 edge? thanks
Pretty ballsy project.  I would break my phone for sure if I tried that!
Does he have Cancer? Bald 2 the max :3
I mean... It looks cool.... but no.
It would be great on LG G6!
This looks freaking awesome Jerry. I am also a fan of see through covers to see internal parts of a tech piece as you. Wish I can do the same without breaking the glass, when I am lucky enough to have a Galaxy S8
This voice is incredible soothing.
Are you a serial killer with a good sense of humour?
Hola Jerry, you are SO loco amigo, I love your stuff. I think the phone looks awesome ;-)
Honeslty it looks Wierd. I know geeks would like it, but if it's not going to make it water resistant anymore, it's not worth to risk, I think a tint would look nice
Indonesian subtitle please
This is an idiotic try
Not totally functional coz u removed wireless charging
Yeah it would be cool if it was a factory option!
that's a really cool look and unique really love your contents. keep it up!
Crazy Skills Very Nice .. If They Make another Hitman Movie You have my vote for the lead.role..
i would showoff my phone so much, I want to do tgis to my note 5
i like this channel and jerry because he's so creative.
not actually fully functional becaus no wireless charging
Son of a bitch are you on drugs always ? Why so sleepy !! God damn wake up man
Hitman is that you? :V
For some reason he reminds me of The MKBHD
Samsung should make these!
I have subscribed to your channel from quite a while now. I am a great fan your camera comparison videos. You try including very type of devices in those comparisons. even Windows phone. :P GREAT JOB!
why is the fingerprint reader gone to hell
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
I cringed and winced the entire time 😱
Agent 47 :D
Ive got hitman on the phone, he wants his hair back....
how the hell that it take me this long to find your video...instant subs
Would you do a drop test with a clear back... I'm wondering if it was the paint that make the spider web stay together  or could it be made into the structure of the glass it's self to break like that
You can't say fully functional anymore btw because no water proof and wireless charging but still cool
what if you placed clear epoxy to fill the phone? will it stay waterproof then?
Clear S8 + Clear Headsets = perfect  actually it looked like my clear IEM lmao
I'm not sure if it's just me but I'd keep the wireless charging on the back of the phone even though it might cover a lot the clear glass still looks great and like nothing else anyone's done before.
The Idea is cool and watching you do this was interesting but boy that is one ugly phone now :D
Great idea, I'll try this on my old nexus 4.
this idea could be one of the greatest creations Samsung may do to make their phones more futuristic than it is now!
what you do of mobile phone aftee test
looks awesome but to risk to try 😞
"This android has a headphone jack" SHOTS FIRED😂
If you break the glass on the back the laminate wont keep it from shattering everywhere, might need a super clear tape or laminate to put back on
if the display cracks can you change only the glass, or it has to be the whole display?
phone just came out,where the f@#$ did you came out with a great idea? bad ass bro 👌 ppl mite not like it but every one has different taste
what paint is used for the logo text on the back. how come it didn't wash off?
cost free my ass thats almost a 1000$ phone I don't see how people can afford to do this
Great project! I would place a nice explosive sticker on the battery just in memory of the Note 7
I was just thinking of doing this with my S7! Will it be possible?
you can't take it to the airport
This guy has that confident "buy from me" car dealership salesman voice....so calm
Damn it looks so clean o_o
I can tell you're in a Home Depot not only because of the price tags, but the music that drills into your skill against your will.
wow its looking so good if i had the  Samsung galaxy s8 ill do it
It is cool but UGLY.  Better looking is not worth to loose WATERPROOF.  It's like even trading a Dollar bill with a Penny. Not a smart move.
I wonder if removing parts makes the phone meet with the FCC emissions. Probably some metal parts are there to contain magnetic fields and electromagnetic radiation.
So cool, I did this with an old iPhone 4s. And you have a great voice to listen to, just a great video.
I would definitely buy one if it was clear or not clear lol
this is freaking awesome it would be cool if you could get the paint off the front panel also.
thats is cool looks great
Will WD-40 work?
should have just bought dot3-4 brake fluid
what do you do with all these phones after testing ??
Not bad for a kid.
Which version did she do? Bowies or Chris Hadfields?
What the fuck is this bullshit off urself
thus was shit
Just from this little clip she reminds me of Gabrielle Aplin.
REPLY TO THIS DELTA
Should have sung mine oddity
20 second clips and a site that doesn't support HTML5 media You're an embarrassment
i just dont get the point of that very short video!!!
Lucy puts her spin on a Bowie classic and I love it! It may be a bit cliche but she has an amazing tone and gets all the coaches except Delta spinning. She picks Seal.
Seriously wish you would start posting the full videos.
What's funny is a kid at our school has Bacterial Meningitis 😂😂
Can someone be the bestest hunty and name the intro and outro song??
Can you make a cute hat that says hunty? Or a shirt? Honestly I've bonded with so many people over that word and it means a lot.
No one wanted to talk about Carly's new hair color in the vlog?? Don't get me wrong I love it. (I was going to put an orange heart emoji but apparently there isn't one!!)

Erin! You're cute!
they're are going to be upset when carly and erin show up
I always told myself that I'd never go to emo nite but you guys are coming to New York for it so I guess I lied to myself. See ya there!!!
I sent you the IKEA bags I am so happy you are using them!!!!!!!
I was wondering how tf Carly could drive with only one foot on the pedals...but then I remembered you drive automatic in the US. so weird to see that ^^
Not That My dad is not cool but Jason is Cool tbh
It's so sweet of them to make a cap with Bobby on it!💜💜💜💜💜
Carly's so cute she looks like a little anime
UHHHHhhh I just had a heart attack because the vlog name is my naMe>?>?>???!?!??! explain yourselves!!!! lol jk its rad

I was laughing sooo much when I saw Carly's leg up on seat while driving
Same!!!!!! I always assume that something is wrong with me lololol I cry
I hope you get a lot of subscribers so that you can buy a washing machine.
i had the exact same face Carly was making as Erin was seeing up their hotel rooms, the "are they really gonna let her get away with this?!" look lol
I love you both to death but how the hell did you two pull off djing at Webster Hall?
See you guys at playlist HUNTTYY
I love the way you sit when your driving Carly
I have diabetes.
I LOVE ERINS HAIR
Social media influences? They influence something that's for sure! ;D
Congrats 200k guys!! Also wtf did Janice do she fucked up the deal!!?
Aww they thought of my name <3 ... and then fired me lol
Make more pop sockets!  I lost mine in my gaping pussy.
I love that Bobby is wearing his hat!😂😂
Jason immediately puts the guitar back down when David says "Jason no!"
i'm sorry I flipped out in front of u guys
Third time Carly has driven a car
Where did Erin get that shirt?😍😅☺️
Anyone else notice David saying  "no Jason"
In this vlog: Erin contacts a doctor on Twitter Next Vlog: Erin posts ad for surgeon  on Craigslist Vlog after: Erin receives treatment options on Tumblr
I like her hair it's fire like her

I started cringing when Erin started lying idk why
bobby is so cute in his merch💙
"I have the worst health anxiety" orrrr also known as hypochondria... lol
Should I get David's merch first or Carly and Erin's ? Hmm the hard questions in life.
I loooove Carly's hair!
BOBBY WEARING HIS OWN MERCH IS SO CUTE CARLY AND ERIN ARE THE PUREST OF ALL THE VLOGGERS
Happy 200k Subscribers keep up the Great work

Kids in africa could've eaten that chicken
anyone else think this guy kinda looks like maxmoefoepokemon?

Watching an Aussie former twink feed Hawaiian chickens yogurt, what the fuck am I doing with my time?
Really nintendo 64 music
OHHH EGGS OF THOUSE MUST BE DELICIOUS
lots of banjo and kazooie music
This is the closest we'll ever get to Steve Irwin
That guy and his bird were cool
I like How they used the banjo kazoee soundtrack
max where the fuck did you get that banjo kazooie shirt
Awww Max and Ian are on their honeymoon :)
Hawaii news next week, Tons of chicken found dead in the forest, not sure what killed them yet, but we did find a lot of different food, it was good
I expected age restriction, this video is full of cocks
For some reason this was very entertaining to watch
5:56 a wild diglit has been found!
PETA WOULD NOT BE HAPPY ABOUT THIS......
Not my proudest fap.
Chickens have cancer now
they are cocks ffs
imagine owner of this chickens coming to this forest and seeing dead chickens with this cake next to them lmfao
chickens will eat anything
That guy at the end is so cute.
Lots of hungry cock and shy pussy in this video. plus food, everyone's fetish has been fullfilled.
nice research we have got here you couple of retards
"We're in Kauai what should we do?"  "Let's go see what we can get the stray chickens to eat and make a video"  I would probably do the same
How is youtube still free 😂😂😂😂
hah "I got him free of the Craigslist".... a fucking bird
This video had no adds play.
Pls dont feed fucking chickens, chicken
Goddammit, I hated the banjo kazooie level with the song that plays while you feed them yogurt
Fuck the chickens, I was listening to that Banjo K the whole time
man, buzzfeed has gone really downhill recently
max i soo love ur vlogs so much the yare amazing n funny as hell i was dying from laughing so much when u fed the chickens all of that food haha amazing vlog u rock man
maxmoefoepokemon sent me.
Max looks like a forest rapist wearing that hat
Chocolate will kill chickens. You could have at least looked to see if what you were feeding is toxic to them
My gf is in hawaii atm please dont steal my fucking girl
This guy is a fucking idiot.
i thought those were cigarette buds in the thumbnail 😂😂😂
I'm dead when u feed the chickens chicken
These videos are just a tiny bit crazier than mine...
Digging the Banjo Music! ~<3
maxmoefoe introduces a new predator to the island: diabeties
Thanks to You, America is better now.
How was there no David Attenborough impersonation in this video?
this video cured my depression this is my new fav vid on the internet
9:25 hey thats idubbbz's anonymous girlfriend
its pronounced   yog urt    not    yo gurt
Is this donkey kong 64 music??
Chickens love niggers
1:34 It starts to turn into the columbine documentary.
Loved the banjo kazooie music mate.
I got told off at my school because we gave chickens bread yeah....
Fucking hell yeH good idea let's feed chicken chicken
from the thumbnail I couldn't tell if it was a really small cake or two very large cigarette butts sticking out of the cake.  the answer is I'm fucking retarded
All dat slightly relevant Banjo-Kazooie music.
ffs kids in africa could've eaten that snickers smh
Aren't most of these songs from Banjo-Kazooie?
How they got through this whole video without making a cock joke is beyond me.
Autistic kid ruins wildlife
In b4 peta takes the video down
wholesome ending
Quality content
That dude is a bird bender
great educational video
im really sitting here in class watching chickens eat random things... what has my life become??
this could actually probably get you fucked by PETA low key tho
The runescape music was clutch
im getting an ad on a video of people feeding chickens. youtube 2017 i guess
Next time go to africa and throw food at the people living in old villages xD
I love the music so much, the memory's are real
i know max and ian's content is supposed to be edgy and shit, but this kinda made me want to unsub. It wasn't even funny.
Banjo kazooi music is lit
Chickens love snickers Niggers love chickens
The chickens eating the yogurt look confused, they look like they're mistaking the white substance for something else...
Chicken like chicken because they are natural cannibals.
we are going to break local and federal law to mow down as much of these feathered cunts as possible -Max
NEXT EPISODE: Max and Ian travel to the main islands of Hawaii and leave heroin for the homeless to see how they react!
This is plain wrong.
SMASHIN that LIKE BUTTTON FOR SOMER OF THOSE CHHHHHHEEEESES CURLZ CHICKENS woo thats good eetin
Why am I watching two gay retards feeding chickens
Isn't that HowToBasic's egg farm?
Aussie faggot and gay cancer patient in remission play with cocks.
This video makes me hungry
Where is HOW TO BASIC
Replace the chickens with hobos and the videos already 10x's better  (Throws sausage chicken cake at homeless man)
I can't even express how much i love this

I would get this dog euthanized
That dog is an old man inside. He thinks the vacuum is too loud.
The dog figured out where the off button is. He'll be using the door bell next. Followed by getting his own smartphone.
doggy is saying your floor is clean enough
That Roomba is loud!  I agree with the dog, turn it off.
that thing is loud as fuck
the dog is trying to tell us something.
Please trash the "roomba" and stop giving the dog stress! It's really annoying to listen... It's pretty noisy that I'm never going to buy this trash! F* Y!
! So simple a dog can turn it off !  Solution: teach the dog to code in Java, and make money off him.
Dog's like "fuck this thing."
Well maybe if Chester wouldn't keep getting assaulted my roomba, he'd leave it on 😀 lol
He's too cute, so funny
Its noisy as fuck and the dog knows it lol
lol at the end he just looks at her and stands in front of the roomba like "No. Leave roomba off."
zero authority in your voice.....the dog is obviously more intelligent than you are.....how do people like this get so fortunate to have everything in their lives
dogs been maltreated by cows
in his former life he was human🐶
I am with the  dog, turn it OFF.
Roomba needs to doggy-proof their machines.
I do not blame him for turning it off. that thing is loud....lol
Yo can I buy that Guitar? Doesn't look like it has strings lol.
good pupper
Chesta: I said I want that shit off!!! Why don't u understand???? Lolol
That's what's waking me up at 6 AM on Saturday from downstairs, I thought my landlord had a meat grinder on.
so oppressed by the white male patriarchy, mommy can't even VACUUM.
hes like but mom, its annoying...can i get a bone or somethin
Why isn't the title " Dumb dog can't listen"
Wife: How was your day honey? Husband:  Tough day at the office, had to take on 3 more clients. Husband:  So how was your day? Wife:  I filmed the vacuum cleaner and the dog for 6 hours.

The nightmare is over....
No, "mommy" is not trying to vacuum.  "Mommy" is being lazy, letting technology do the work for her. If "mommy" was vacuuming, Chester would not be able to turn the vacuum off.
Roomba abuse!!!!  Also, mommys not vacuuming.  Roomba is LOL
Bitch the house is clean!
And someday, the dog will finally figure out how to turn this lady off too. And finally get some goddamn peace and quiet.
do these work it's sounds like it could damage your stuff
Guess Chesta doesn't like a clean room
Pushing a button so a robot can "clean" is not actually vacuuming. Good boy for turning the loud piece of crap off! 👍🏻
HIS NAME IS SHASTA??? I thought she was saying Chesta the entire time!
there are only Yellow Labs, some are just more red or white than other! ;-)
At the end  Women: did you turn roomba off  *zooms in at the dog  Dog: no shit dunbazz, you fucking saw me
i wanted a roomba but its too loud poor pup
mommy's not trying to do shit
glad I didn't purchase one....to noisy....I don't blame chester one bit for shutting it off...
Y'all have a nice house
Rich people own roombas, poor people own knocksoffs like me
Our pups think our rumba is alive and want to attack it!
dog was like fuck your Roomba
This is the only reason not to own a goofy roomba, it's bad for animals!  My animals come first!  No to roomba!
That dog is done with your shit lady. I'm not suprised he hasn't turned himself into another family
he did it. the ultimate good boy. he beat the vacuum
👎 because you even own one of these!
YOU'RE!! trying to vaccum?!?!? lazy people. the dog knows your lazy AF! that's why he turns it off, to get you to actually do something.
Uh lady...hate to break it to ya, but the puppy thinks it's a game. Nice floors👍🏻
Lol smart doggie and so cute!!!
That's an easy floor to clean, 5 minutes with a broom and dustpan and you'd be done. That Romba is annoying af, I think the dog is smarter than the owner to keep turning it off.
mommy is trying to vacuum... you're full od shit. and im sure when your husband comes home from work, you're like "not now honey, ive had a busy day" what a lazy scumbag
Please help and or share if you can thanks https://www.gofundme.com/Kingsleey
Chester says F that loud machine
that dog should bite your ass for being so damn lazy and needing a rebot to do a damn floor.
I love the look on his face at the end, as if saying, "It's annoying. It stays off."
mommys trying to vaccum? might be a lil on the heavy side lol
I love how every time he turns it off he stares at her like "yeah bitch I turned it off what are you gonna do about it"
I remember the days when if you wanted to change the TV channel, you had to get off your fat ass and walk across the room and turn a knob.
What a smart dog! Adorable!
Lol cute dog. I love the look he gives right after turning it off, it's like a " yes!!! You know I turned it off and you know why!!!"
I make free moving backgrounds for anyone to use
"Hey did you see that video of the dog turning the roomba off?"     Just think about that
Aw, this is adorable. I especially love the faces Shasta makes every time he's told to turn it back on.
she actually filmed it Vertically , but held the camera horizontal....lol ☺
the dog is like... "ok i will be strong for you!!!" .... while later "oh god ican't take it anymore"
Controversial statement
momys trying to vacume???? WTF you are just standing around doing shit...

havenhurst is the name of the movie, it says right after the beginning scene.
Dark tower!

NOT the Dark Tower !!!
two thumbs down
Is it me or did he not really answer the guys question?
hmm how to balance making a difference/passion and being able to have your finances taken care of (practicality)  has always been the million dollar question.
Thanks for this Gary. A video I'm gonna save and share with anyone who is thinking of non-profit. it really can save  some people some heartache. :)
This is why we love you !!!! Truth at its finest 😊
I don't understand this one can somebody explain to me please?
idk if anyone ever told you but you sound like Joe Pesci
Good shit Mr Vee!
The gift that keeps on giving. The last two lines were epic! He flips the discussion like Gordon Ramsey would flip an omelette
Question.  How do you have 267K subs and ZERO VIEWS?  #bots #payforsubs
first time i see that many female skateboarders in one video! besides they're really good, wow... :)))
Eric and Berra be whipped asf
I remember wen I started skating in the early 2000's and how at the time there weren't very well known girl skaters that were pretty or even really that cute.  But now, damn, there are some hotties.  Mmm Leticia...
Nice valley girl voice Angela, ugh annoying.
Oh Angela I'd like to make multiple donations on your Nonprofits.
poseident to earthquakes to shaking things up in the mindset of society was a bit far fetched to say the least lol
she's quite a annoying little CUNT

Well, now I know what causes Diesel runaway (cause I looked it up) and what shit music sounds like (because I forgot he could have used a rapp background).
Ahole Mania more like it....Music sucks
A lot of pointless smoke!!!!
What happened to the thumbnail pic of the huge engine on fire at the intro end of this lot??
Music destroys another video. If I wanted a music video, I would be watching fucking music videos!!
OMG IT's AMAZING!!!
there has to be an emergency cut off switch surely ?
crappy music
top killing the earth moments
what a pile of shit
that engine on the thumbnail is edited cuz that engine wasnt running
stupid music ruins another video. thumbs down .
Fuck that music man, fuck it.
what a freaking moron!!!!  turn the damn music off... god, these retards and their fucking music!
FUCK THE MUSIC.
Stupid music too damn loud
AMBIENCE PICS !
bleh muzak fail. also why dont they install valve to turn off the fuel.?
Terrible music makes the video unwatchable. Fail.
Who can be this stupid by putting music in this video?
why would you play that shit over the cars engine run away sound??that's the dam point of wanting to watch the video!! idiot you have completely ruined the video!! thanks 😡👎  👎👎👎👎thumbs down👎👎👎👎
Bunch of world killing hillbillies.
Stupidest music, ever.
Another batch of STUPID music covers up the video!
Yes, very stupid music, so i stoppen looking, send a new video with real sound
Fuck that stupid music
Leave the damned muzak out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The dynamics of the sound of runaways completely covered by that damn loud music.
Thanks for not telling everyone about my violent diarrhoea slip 'n' slide incident at Wagamama. Your discretion is greatly appreciated x
Please make more videos
I go under the bars like basically always
I was right next to the vidcon but couldn't go but i did see some people from there

Why don't your Charecters were pants! Swoozie didn't have pants on! That's gross!
Let me translate the dutch sign :D  Specializing in natural careproducts and nutritional supplements I am bored :)
Jaiden says she didin't know how the bathroom worked ._.
Jaiden says " Hi!" by the way Jaiden never dies!
3:00 "Haven't tasted it yet,  [Seriously]?"
Shame on you Tim Tom, Jaiden tried to tell us that you were a very nice person!!! Nah JK ...love your vidz, man
Just a little something about the 3 letters thing: Fairies in Dutch = feeën  :D

The most unoriginal youtuber ever
Who came here because of Jayden?

Do you mean it!😭 Jayden is weird!?!
"At least if he murders us, we'll make a good video about it" You'd be dead by then, TimTom.
she said that to OMG I can't believe it there is two meals left and she was like it's perfect
It's Yeeelt It's Yeelt It's Beetle It's Yeet.
"What they gonna do..kick me out?" -Jaiden
why are you so mean to jaiden!  you mean marshmellow
Sees duck man. Me: what the duck?
Sees duck man. Me: what the duck?
you sound like game/film theory
Maybe it's his pet duck
you mean the Swoothest guy.... heh
This is the exact opposite of Jaiden's vid.
You sound like James lol
I know Kaiden said only one person should do this but...   J A I D E N.      S A Y S.      H I !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ulta smooth swoozie is my fav part.
Jaiden is not weird.
why are you saying  that
I'm sorry if this is a bit personal, but are you from Minnesota?
You should make more videos! I love them! You have great stories and a great animation. Like Jaiden(Jaiden Animations) and James(TheOdd1sOut)
Is anyone also searching if tomska commented on this video ?
When you said "we were surrounded by" I thought that you were surrounded by police lol
'He's pretty tall for a marshmallow ^w^' ~Jaiden Animations 2017
show us your feet
"...But Jaiden BROKE everything..." It's cool to see the two videos on the two different channels expand upon everything and give us a fuller view and perspective on what happened.
Pff. Millennials.  I don't care what language you speak, three of the same letter is TOO MANY!

All rude and inappropriate (that I deem) will be removed.
he totally loved it! He even caught pink eye from it.
my sister told me, when I was 9 and she was 8, "that girls don't fart" now 50 years later I know she was fibbing !
I thought HOT women didn't pass gas, or burp, or shit and thus not have to ever wipe their ass. Wow, you learn something everyday.
" you cant cut the cheese wherever you please"
either you gotta laugh about it, or hide your head in shame... It's good that they laughed.  I would have cried.
She was so cool about it!
That was hilarious
That is so hot.
Thanks trump.
LMAO!!!! that's so embarrassing 😅😅😅
Are they in the Windy City
Good sport.
00:22 I caught wind of that
understandably funny.
something about this story STINKS
haha, kzok brought me here. "right on the mic" he says!  LOL!!!  prolly smelt like roses?  Unlike men..lol
at least they were both good sports about it
At first,I was wondering why David was laughing and what is so funny then I know why. Lindsay,girls don't pass gas. Men do.
Classic!  Haha...too funny!!
Nothing wrong about being wrong once in a while, as long as one is willing to admit one was wrong 😊 You might still be right, but let's hope that's wrong and they win this friendly fight. Right?
The only thing I didn't like about you was that you didn't like space X, now, I like you even more hahha. thumbs up!!
+1 just for being cool about it. lol.
The techonology it takes too do this, to calculate every little imbalance and correct it so precisley with rockets... It's so friggin' scifi!
Totally agreed. I was wrong too.
the inner 80s kid in me was blown away about how damn fast that landing was.   TV and MOvies told me big rockets would land slowly with deliberate not plunk down super fast.  the scale of that is just mind boggling.
"What about sex" was what I read at first and then I took a second look.
its this sort of I know everything and something is not possible that limits potential.
Good on you, Hank!
Holy shit you're the first person I've seen to admit it instead of falling back on some other issue. Subbing just for that, good on ya man
wait another 20 years and we'll have commercial travel lmao
I think Elon Musk's project of a hyper-loop is wrong though. It's not wrong in that it encourages innovation. It's wrong in that it isn't feasible at any level.
Thunderf00t should also make a video like this
I want spaceX​ to send Tesla Vehicles to Mars!
I think a lot of people were wrong about Elon and his SpaceX at the start.
most useless video in history
WOW.  Unlike many you tube posters you are a man of honor and integrity.  It takes courage to admit a mistake though we all make many of them.  Kudos and best wishes to you.
Simple question. How did the rocket slow down while touching the ground without any change in thrust?
a smart person changes its mind when evidence point in the other direction.
Ah, a convert :) Welcome to SpaceX fandom, brother. We have awesome, reuseable rockets :D
subscribed to this channel just because of the last sentence of this video! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
That's big of you. JOKE: If you had a gig for SpaceX would you... Rock it?
it's so important to be able to admit you were wrong, thank you hank ^-^ (also yeah, spacex is fucking awesome)
Respect, of course, for the classy mea culpa.  But Elon himself has said it is barely possible. I guess he trusted the math.
Fuck off, hank. People like you keep us from progress.
Herge's rocket 'designs' were pretty similar to what spacex is doing...so i'm guessing this idea is pretty old, good on him making it work tho!
Do you happen to know Falcon9's terminal velocity speed while falling back to earth?
Yeah, do the math like Elon ;) (he is just great)
If Hank Green says they're cool... I'monna listen (and judge for myself obviously, but he knows more than me and is really, really awesome)
That's my boyfriend's mom's rocket!
Initially my brain was insisting that the rockets landing were actually rocket launches being played backward! 😂 Hank you're awesome 😊
Good to know I wasn't the only one in this situation.
I wish @thunderfoot could admit he was wrong like that! Hank is awesome
Hank secretly being held at gunpoint by Elon Musk
This is clearly a spaceX paid sponsor.
Glad to see you saw the light and admitted it, now there's the mark of learning and besides it is just so damn cool to see a two way rocket, up and back down.
You are a fucking piece of shit. You know dits Bullshit.. how do you sleep at night. lying to me and my friends
I was wrong too!
You are awesome!
Ok. Wasn't there to witness you saying it was nuts to begin with but credit to anyone who can admit their mistakes. Wish more people would be as willing to do so.
Dang it Hank what i like about you- besides your haircut of course- is your ability to grow.  Son ya give me hope. ;)
Hank, I really really appreciate how attentively you are about things like this.
Where can I learn more about this?
It's very beautiful to have or witness a change of heart. A newfound sense of understanding, the thought of "Wow, this is actually so cool!".
Oh wow... for a second there I thought you had the video running in reverse.
Man, there's something so strange about watching these landings. It's so cool and amazing what humans can do. But it's like watching an egg unscramble itself.
i love when people can admit they are wrong.
I got to watch the SES-10 mission with Falcon 9, and it was beautiful. I may have teared up a bit.
Have you heard sky hooks? They plausible to work in conjunction with reusable rockets.
Respect you for admitting that.  It's crucial to growth and not many want to do that.
why did this make me get choked up?
Elon Musk is going to take over the world, isn't he?
Good to heard you changed your mind on this, Hank!
When I saw the clip, I actually thought you were just showing a take off in reverse, but apparently not. Caps off to you, SpaceX.
Yo Hank, if you could make more videos of you talking over rocket launch/landing footage, I'd be completely OK with that.
Are you sure you´re not just trying to get 478 rockets?
Impossible is nothing.
it hurt to watch those clips knowing they WEREN'T being played backwards.
Just wait until Space XI
I always noticed a slight grudge towards SpaceX in your SciShow vids.  I´m glad you realized you were wrong and were honest about it.
Very curious to see if refurbishment will end up being too expensive to make re-use as economical as predicted
I thought it was a good idea, but I know nothing about engineering. I just know that Elon Musk is a smart cookie. Good for you for admitting you'd changed your mind. The internet could use more of that.
how does it find the spot to land so perfectly?!? it blows my mind the precision this has!! love it
Hank Green was wrong? Inconceivable!
Love when someone finds out that a multi billion dollar is smarter than him. Just incredible 😂
You came to that conclusion just now? Or maybe I'm just easily convinced.
This is how society should treat being wrong; informatively and without shame. Seriously, the would would be such a better place. Also hell yeah rocket science.
(like I've heard before) Now was that so hard?
Good for you, Hank
It's beautiful to watch those rockets landing like that.
This is why Hank is one of my idols.
Rockets and Capitalism-it works
Thank you, Hank.  This is what reputable people do.  You keep an open mind.   If you get new information, you revisit your old decisions.  and if you make a mistake, you admit it.   This is how knowledge advances.
4,379 views + 558 upvotes + 0 downvotes = Everybody loves an honest and unqualified apology.
Admitting you were wrong about something so trivial is hardly as commendable as some of the commenters seem to think.
Elon Musk is playing too much Kerbal Space Program. Or too little. Not sure.
Very well done.  I hope this brings in more donations and support for the agencies that provided so much.
Well I timed that refresh perfectly.
Favourite part was when Wildcat was behind the toilet.. couldn't help but laugh with them 😂
Velly shit shpot.
pankcake store

I thought he was the the toilet because of the angle and then it turns out e was fucking behind the toilet XD
Why does Delirious look incredibly aroused in the thumbnail?

It took me three God damn rewinds to finally see the big ass trash bin leave the room.
HOLY SHIT :D
0:10 Wow Daithi is blind as shit.
terrorisers a bitch
wait how can  that cheaty terroriser had 3 nuketubes?

For some reason i thought this was a terrorizer video
i love how the video is just shouting and swearing and his outro is so calm😂😂
4:10 "tiki bitch"
My comment is so well hidden it would be considered a Brian spot.
00:10  me: *slow face palm*
Nogla was i that video as well   11:10

Why is Brian so fucking annoying god damn. Like he plays in a douchey spot then just goes "wooow you're so salty" like a little 10 year old like wtf
If Nogla's channel is a bin on fire, then i guess we're all hobos coming together to share that fire
0:09  really nogla?!   O.O
Terrorizer can be annoying when he brags about cheap wins.

6:04 *seductive bhangra pose* lol
oh boy you are a sardarboy ! BHANGDA OBJECT
Sardars will always be stupid. Bunch of Pothead motherfuckers!! Lol
way to go Vikram , Nailed it . Par still its sardar's fault they have made such image in society for which people take it too much serious as nobody have much time to differentiate who is what kind
Brilliant job.
that was too good paaji... keep rocking

There's a giant sand worm check it out
the cats are on the antennas
that green thing
dude its aliens its like a U.F.O shooting the moon
he's not  shirty shut up
if you kill the biggest sandworm with the green laser of death it gives you a bobo fet skin that has a working jetpack on it
pungence there's a green buoy by the laser and if you kill the giant horse and warm you get to have a jetpack on the moon from a guy with Star Wars
there's a mama sandworm
there's a mama sandworm
just to let you know, those intena things there's a green one and it acts like the green buoy that attracts the megoladon BUT instead it attracts a giant SAND WORM!!!

i liked this video i was scerd to
no wonder why he only get 800k subscriber
pungence is gay
pungence do you like the update
I forgot to tell you something find the green satellite thingy and there will be a surprise and I don't mean the laser

ALSO YOU CAN ACTUALLY ARREST DONALD TRUMP AND GET HIS COSTUME
U CAN HOLSTER 2 ITEMS NOW

you should play Roblox or Minecraft some day in a video
You should make a sequel to quest to save Swindon but it's about the moon or includes  the moon
Can you get the sand worms in the green lazer or in the red líne
Sand worms are the sharks of the moon
pungence theres a giant sand worm like the megladon at a green antenna also the giant green lazer is to kill the giant sand worm and the worms only show up in craters.

THER IS A BIG SAND WORM JUST LIKE TO GIANT SHARK
128 people thought the dislike button was the like button.how convincing :3
I think that the sand worms drop samples when they die because when pungence killed them you could see a chunk of meat and a golden crystal.

she's really something
This was a great race. Elaine, one word...Awesome.
Man-O-man....what a champion ....Elaine Thompson!!!!
Elaine taking no hostage
Wen Elaine shift in third gear everybody dead.. Congrats ladies.
Great Anchor By Thompson
Brap Brap Brap. don't fuck with elaine thompson yeah you hear me
English Gardner had the lead but Akinoson couldn't hold it we needed Tori Bowie or Carmelita jeter to run anchor
what last leg was sick Elaine Thompson wow
Jamaican run for fun don't mess with them.
Jamaica all the wayyyy....
It would be much more cooler if you to say "I fucking getting outta here, I will let John me to pick up, kips ;)" then leave.
Show us how you built this.
how did u make it touchscreen ?
Altho the concept is very nice, you might have a problem with people not wanting to deal with dirty mirrors all the time, but im sure there are solutions for that
i have a similiar idea how much would  you charge for a program
the square and the mirror are not parallels
te mirror it's in a straight line while de square at the start doesnt
this is fake
Oh, It's Wonderful!!!  Good For You & Lucky Us! Can't wait to see more from you & to purchase your mirror!  ~ Peace!
You can see a green screen in the reflection of his glasses.
Am I the only one that thinks the mirror will be quite dirty?
Where I buy a mirror foil
So awesome!
so all the mirror will be full of fingerprints ?
where did you get your touch screen overlay from
your are super super awesome bro,but how did u made it
Nice would want that but only the mirror with screen/touch capabilities and connect it to a raspberry pi
hey can we chat about the mirror via email?
this is awesome!!
Not to sound like a douche or anything but uhh.....what's the point of this????
Are you going to make a video on explaining the stuff inside (and/or) how to make a mirror like this, and are you going to put the code online?
Damn I would love one of those mirrors.
I want voice control and gesture recognition, because I am not too keen on touching a mirror.
wonderful bro  its brilliant
you need to create music app
what if you install this product on the tub shower walls. it would be amaZimg
send me the soft ware u made
marry me haha wow.. You put some thought into this. I am totally amazed by your talent. I have seen some smart mirrors but this one I liked it the best
wow its impressible , I love inventions ummmaaaaaa
I bet John is pissed off
Hi, I sent you a PM.  I'd be very interested in having a short discussion about coding and engineering on a glass related project.
How can I buy one of these?
this is an amazing project. I would love to build this for my pad, any chance you're sharing?
real life scenario :  "shit, im late" *reddit notification* *an hour later* "yeah im feeling quite sick, can i take a day off ?"
You are going to be really good at this! :)
Is there a how-to on this? I actually would like to build this myself.
sickest mirror I've ever seen! amazing job!
Great Job man.  Looks awesome!
RPi, large monitor, one way mirror, and IR frame to enable touch. Entirely possible. Love it! Well done.
please add mt to the list of people, that one to buy one!
Theory  Tap a phones touchscreen with paper over it, it works. I guess paper and one way mirror sheets have something in common.
How much time did it take you to develop the final product? Excellent work mate.
lo, so obviously fake you can tell by looking at it - can't believe ANY idiot is sucked in by this.  And yes of COURSE it is possible, but THIS is not a real one in this video...
Hi fantastic   How did you make the screen I've always wanted to make my own screen
Have you created an API for MagicMirror2 for this touch screen ordeal, also...what monitor did you use? Congrats in all the work that was put into this.
Shut up and take my money!
daym that like a touch screen TV
Nice it would be cool if i could buy one like this
wow! loved it
How do you make a gui like this? im getting in to c++ programming and i want to make nice looking GUI. I have been looking in to Qt, but no way i can make something like this
how do you make that?
Hello!  sameone know if used a big touch screen conversion for make the touch mode?
Wow. The mirror looks great, the software runs so smoothly, and the UI is so simply and beautifully designed. Great job man.
How did you make the mirror touchscreen?
Incredible work!
My guess:  Touchscreen overlay kit + raspberry pi + monitor  Then again I could be completely wrong :)
Add wi-fi capabilities to this device, and you can convert this to a an interactive coffee table. Dude, this is crazy.
That is so fucking cool
You need to add support for various voice assistants to it if that's possible :)
I just really want to know what did you use for touchscreen?
*smudges mirror *
It's actually pretty awesome, I'm planning to learn java and that stuff but im now curious what language does raspberry pi use? I wanna do something like this in the future
hi I am new in this industries can you help me to make as i want to gift my mother in her birthday please can you help me
dude this is great!
That is beautiful!
pls make more  videos :p
it's Android honeycomb launcher
These things have "neat" appeal, but it does not seem to add real value. I'd be more annoyed with how often I have to clean finger prints off the damn thing.
Dude this is amazing, dont listen to other people man you look fine in this video
You're gonna make so many people late for work...
i just subscribed, i hope you can ship one of those beauties to Norway :)
PLEASE DO A TUTORIAL
Dude this is insane you should Kickstart this
may i ask why in the hell would anyone need a touchscreen mirror? like what makes it better than a tablet?
You are very talented, I'm sure to see some of your products in the future. Very interested in this mirror. Do you have more info on the software/hardware?
can you give us one for $1000
Can you set up auditory controls so that I don't have to dirty up my mirror?  Thanks, - Damien
its a shame this isnt open sourced! let me get at your code and ill build the mirror myself! i dont have time or money to wait for your fancy one..
is there an possibility to get your softweare?
DUDE THIS IS FREAKING AWESOME
Cool concept but you get a lot of fingerprints on your mirror. if you attempt building something like this, make sure it is moisture resistant.
this is amazing. Great Job!
It is possible for this to be done but I am fairly sure this was all done in post
That's so cool!
this is awsome. do you have a video of how you made it?
excellent ux design one of the best ive seen so far
He's looks like Franklin from #GTA5
Okay honest question, why does everyone hate Amy? I think she's funny. I don't really follow her tho so idk.
If only Amy cringe-schumer wasn't on that couch.
MY spirit animal is Kyle ren
What, no Star Wars stuff??!!!
When the actor is funnier than the comedian
Saxophone and clarinet lamps, how did no one make an electric light orchestra joke?
1:14 Graham is like... straight people... *shakes head* I'll never understand them This is upsetting my gay sensibilities
If that toilet knight wards off girls like Amy Schumer, I want one.
Saxophone lamp is funnier than Amy Schumer
Loved your role in moonlight man! Amazing
For how much money he has now, this is tame lol
he should get a blue lightsaber bulb
everytime amy schumer speaks the audience goes quiet
I must be weird because I don't see anything wrong
Can someone ID the bomber jacket which John Boyega is wearing in this clip for me, please? :)
Cast Orlando Bloom for Star Wars!
Why is Amy on the show? I've never seen or heard a more unfunny person.
Nothing I lovemore then a average English person going from a struggling actor to A-list.
Amy Schumer is the worst thing ever
1:41 LOVE John's Laugh! 😂
The saxophone's mouthpiece is backwards
Imagine him bringing a girl home. ''Yeah, my house has a few strange things in it..'' :girl: ''Oh! That fine!'' (walks in) ''Oh...........''
I love this boy
I think that 'buy' was meant as a 'bye'.
He's got awesome taste! Nothing weird about that.  They're gonna kinda dumb for making of that.
wow what a madlad
Ew is that Amy Schumer?
That toilet paper holder is pretty darn neat.
" something in my brain said to me "buy" " that's called TV boyega...
Im the same way with my salary lol Oh look money! should i pay rent? Nooooo! Amazon time!XD
People saying that all he cares about is the money so if you got cast in Star Wars you would never spend any of your money
"I'm African" - Lol, your a London Boy through and through.
John is a better comedian than Amy, and he isn't even a comedian (as far as I know).
Of course the one thing Amy Schumer says is about a one night stand
Amy Schumer had to shutup here cause she's overwhelmed by the funnier ppl surrounding her
I thought the last thing was going to Be StarWars related😔😳
wheres daisy i want to see them tgther
whos the fat tranny in the middle
Boyega has the best taste when it comes to jackets!
I just fell in love with John
Reminds me that Chris Rock bit about rich black people lol
"That's a red flag"? I bet people say that about most of the things she does now a days.
"Glorified nonsense" XD lol
2:54 GIF PLEASE
Lord of the Rings & Star Wars meet.
Chivalry isn't dead, it's in John Boyega's bathroom.
this show was absolutely hilarious
Star Wars is the best movie of all times.
African lions could have eaten that toilet paper holder
Next genocide and holocaust will come for the Hollywood. Mark my words.
Amy Schumer is fat.
Looks like a Dark Souls knight
Usually when comedians are guests they try to crack jokes every 5 seconds and considering how chatty Amy Schumer is Im pleasantly surprised that she's just sitting there quietly.
Ugh Schumer? Gotta leave a dislike
amy schumer trying to get in at every sentence is awful .... but she clearly couldn't remember any other comedians jokes 
he looks like denzel washingtons son..
why is amy schumer there.
i also bought something for my bed when i first made money...a real bed instead of cardboard
Finn and Legolas!  Legends!
I want to see John Boyega in the new Kathryn Bigelow movie "Detroit".
dude! Conserve your money!
The real red flag would be someone looking at Amy Schumer and saying "Ya, she's the one I want to take home."
I'm doing this for the 666 comments
How did they keep that whale alive in the couch without water!
Amy shcumers while face is a red flag.
These purchases are hardly "insane"... kmt.
Amy is a red flag, not the toilet paper holder.
WTF???  Am I seriously the only one who thought about DARK SOULS with that TP holder???
I would destroy the universe if I could get a chance to marry John Boyega.
I think you can buy all that stuff at garden ridge
"That's a red flag" 😍
Why do Americans always feel the need to ensure they say something every couple of minutes?
Everyone's spirit animal should be John Boyega!! 😁😁 🦁🦁
John Boyega is one BAMF.
I see Amy Shitmer i click off
I feel like Orlando is leaning towards John like, "Who *is* this crazy lady on my right?"
Does John Boyega wanna like....fall in love with me...? He's so adorable lol
Why does everything with Amy have to be about being a girl? Like "I got to his house, AS A GIRL, and I see that and its a red flag! BUT AS A GIRL! Cuz men aren't capable of being freaked out"
Who's the funniest on that couch? Definitely not the comedian
Seeing how the sax is set up pains me as a tenor player
whoa they forgot to add all the graphics at the end of this video lol time to fire the intern
John Boyega is the best😂
That's called unprotected sax
Is Amy Schumer meant to make you laugh?  All I see is a fat chick shouting her loud opinions.
Looks like the guy just likes to buy stuff, and i would say some of these stuff are cool !!!!
John Boyega is not fit for star wars he looks like high school jock.......If this comment makes me racist for your kind information i am black
John Boyega is such a classy dude xD
wow, Amy schumer is really unfunny.

Sounds like his home is much more interesting than the new Star Wars films.
TIL Bill Burr is the king of Shitlords.
Mr Burr is such a Biggot! And I LOVE IT !
Conan is Bill's straight man
bill and louis are always amazing at interviews and conan is probably the funniest most genuine host out there
"what are you talking about?" Basically conan everytime he talks to Bill
honestly the only reason I watch, conan is because bill Burr is on it just hilarious
I mean, if you catch something it should be yours. You shouldn't have to give it to a kid
Bill Burr my twin brother from another....we think so much alike!
'Bill Burr, sir'
Bill burr is f awesome!
A Bill Burr a day keeps the bullshit away
I'm not ready for the day when one of this guys will be gone.
It's kinda messed up, but I idolize Bill Burr
Bill burr is a genius
don't watch his new special with a fat friend. there is a solid 15 minutes of slamming fat people haha
Is this footage from 2014?
Bill should've been president instead of doll head Trump!
When he said "yeah it's workin alright.." i spit seltzer water all over my computer.
Bill Burr is the best !
longliv billburr a legendary comedian with truth in his rants n commonsense solutions 😂😂U SHOULD BE PRESIDENT😂😂
Each time Bill gets on Conan knows he's dealing with a ticking time bomb but it turns out great every time!
Classic Bill
Kids are mushy and fat...I live in Tennessee and I get to see a lot of buses unloading on my drive to work. Lots of little mushy ones waddling off them buses.
I do fat shame myself...I'll purposely put on clothes that won't fit and make fun of myself...then go work it off. Nothing wrong with self-check...
59 fatties disliked this video
Bill Burr is the most honest comedian .
I heard Bill Burr does give his foul balls to kids, EEEYYYY
that woman in the background 😂😂😂😂
1:41 - that's exactly how I dropped 35 pounds and got in shape. It works.
proper order with bill burr
Angriest Irish turtle who ever lived.
New Bill Burr interview on Conan? Fantastic!!
My wife is so fat that when she goes for a swim the tide changes.
Whenever this Bill Burr's fever ends (which I hope it never happens) I would really love Conan to make some videos with the one and only Jordan Schlansky like in the old days.
where is the whole thing?  Ballz
I like how high pitched his voice gets when he starts to rant.
This makes so much sense it hurts
more Burr !
frank murphy!
Bill Bur so honest, stay humble.
Is there more from him on this visit? Can't imagine he came for 2 minutes.
Always the best guest on the show :D
Do they just have an archive of Bill Burr clips they can upload at any time?
When I was a kid my Dad shot me in the head with a real gun, killing me instantly, but it made me a stronger person!
Slow kiss rape Korean computer figure find flash.
Coming To Netflix: "Bill Burr's Fat Camp Challenge"
As much as a fan i'am of his, and despite his success.. I still think he is waaaay too underrated. Especially when bringing up Louis C.K. Calm down fanboys. I just think Louis is the Sienfeld of fart jokes.
bill burr is on here like every other week lol, i love it
You know when a show has a favorite guest is when they re-upload old videos.
My question is why was this uploaded 3 days ago when the interview is from 2 years ago haha. Awesome interview regardless. Conan is the only host who can handle & work with Burr's comedy.
Are these the same jokes from the last time? Or just a reupload of before.
Well played, Sir Burr.
Bill Burr 2020
Seems to be working for him. He seems leaner
Bill is going to be the textbook grouchey dad whose deep down too liberal.
this is pure gold
bill is the best. if Norman Lear reboots All in the Family bill should be the new Archie
To those who have Netflix, January 31st is the release of Bill Burr's latest Stand Up Special!
Bill Burr I. Love. You.
Billy the kidless no longer
Cringe cause Andy is sitting right there :)
Who doesnt like bill burr
Hahaha ! Bill is so right !
Bill is the best... never too much Bill.
bill burr should be my life coach
This clip is like 6 months old wtf is going on
assault grief found opera living cry wealthy who rank.
aaaannnddd the bill burr recommended youtube video binge has begun
Please have Bill Burr on every week for the rest of time.
Bill Burr is a beast. One of the best comics alive in my opinion. Also I can't get enough of the Burr/Conan duo : )
the funniest comedians are the most relatable ones, all he does is just tell the honest truth in his bits and it's hilarious.
fackin late upload, team coco..  Everyone's is fine, but not bill burr's.
Love Bill Burr! This is what happens if you take Larry David, make him several notches more socially acceptable, and then ratchet the brutal relentless unspoken truths up to eleven.
Conan been pushing a lot of bill burr on this channel as of late
Ol'Billy boy reminds me of a ginger turtle.
he always goes off the chain when he's on Conan hilarious to watch
I love this guy
It's kind of surprising they let Bill Burr on so much, most of these networks are so left leaning they would hate the things he says.
Bill needs hi sown show...
I love Bill Burr- he tells it like it is.
Burr is best.

KK will hv a clear  short if Ndalamo leaves that building
lol guy's this interesting Movhango is always the case one way or another the must be a fight or is not Movhango
Hangwani didn't have to go to venda though
is this mulalo child Susan's baby?
hangwani is slaying colours like her
Hanging needs that slap
Muvhango still owes us an explanation of how Vhangani turned into Vhangani,the chief's bodygurad when he first played Azwindini,the chief
where is scandal nhai weduwe
Hangwani lv Rendani more thn Ndalamo
muvhango writers take the distance between jozi and venda lightly. so ndalamo slaps rendani and then hangwani drives to venda to tell the chief??? its called a cellphone
That child at Mulalo's house, is of Chief. He knew that if he let him stay at the palace, he would be circumcised. Thats y he said Tebogo should look after that child
VhoMukondoleli's hair is always on point. To whoever is doing her hair, respect to you. you know your thing.
thats susan & Azwi's 👶🏽 the teasers say so if u add one plus one. they aren't going to adopt it
go and take care of that baby now😃 the chief has spoken  no bra,you are making cupcakes 🙊hahaaaa  #by ginde  #by ginya
eix am just worried for ndalamo
Hangwani is gone to tell the chief about Ndalamo slapping Rendani because the chief knows very well how it feels like to get a shisampama. Chief was once slapped by Thandaza
haiboo Chief says Teboho must look after that child
i think that baby is susans the chief wants the baby to grow up amoung the mukwevhos but not in the palace so that he wnt be circumcised......wat a clever idea chief
Where is KK
if that is child in mulalo's is susan's uhmm i will say they are truly clever no one will take that child to be circumcised
i Think Ndalamo is leaving Muvhango
uuuum they take a bad decision on Ndalamo
Vusi and Kat act sooo boring 😷
The child is a Mukwevho but I am not sure which Mukwevho brother it is.  The DNA will be positive but it is not Mulalo......and everybody say: "Yes papa....prophesy major 1"
😳😳😳😳😳that gal behind Nonny and Sthe is eating a muffin with a spoon 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 ndochirungu here?????
Mokwevho people are crazy. So now Teboho is expected to accept the baby just like that? Ayi!
kat and V are so cute together
I like uMasindi sometimes mabehlangene noVhafhuwi😂😂😂😂😂. I like what they did to Teboho.
bafui plan to remove ndalamo from a CEO position and put hu?????????
Ndalamo's contract is not being renewed. I think this is his exit from the show.
Hope thats not Susan's bbe at Mulalo's house
Hangwani should be everyone's mum. My mum would ask what I did to be slapped lol
the distance between venda nd joburg for rendani's mum to go all the way just to report that to the chief couldnt she call ?
Tebogo is cute ...
hangwani say the whole truth why are you leaving KKs name ndiye akakonzeresa
DNA test Mulalo!! DNA TEST!! #maurypovich Ndalamo is in deep @#$%.
South Africa I'm coming there to get me a Sthe..eish the guy is tooo cute,a charmer😍😍
chief thats too harsh!!!!! hangwani u see now!!! next time dont rush, KK is going to be happy
If Ndalamo was Hangwani's son, I doubt she would've acted that way
Still trying to comprehend why Vusi forgave Sthe after lying about his fathers disappearance
Rendani's Mom is exactly My Mother😍😍😍
hangwani is such a ...
How can the chief pronounce a sentence without hearing Ndalamo's side of the story? Is there no due process in Venda culture?
ooooo if ndalamo leaves kk at mmc i guarantee a harsh fall fo the mukwevho
eish bad luck for NDALAMO
Wow...plz go back to 15:11 nd listen carefully  In luv with that tone
Did anyone notice the handwriting on the note doesn't look like one of an adult 😂😂 03:27
Azwindini you are making a wrong move honestly
muvhango celebrating 20 years. Busi and Vusi ba 20 somethings years, yet they were born now now.
i  also made it
I miss the old Makhadzi. The one who use to irritate the chief's mother. She played her character so well. This makhadzi doesn't do it for me.
as long ngiku top 10 have made it in Life
champagne pop is a very pretty highlight and all, but girrlllllll you're a beauty guru, try out other highlighters and show them WITHOUT champagne pop covering them up

I really freaking love you! Your obsession over make-up is amazing and you always crack me up! Anyway, you are seriously awesome! Love your vids so much!
I have never even heard of capari or whatever and I watch tons of these videos and have for years
When you get your dinner to watch this too, and halfway you are thinking about dessert. #freakinglovelongvideos
Where's your wedding ring?   I miss seeing it on you......
God you're just amazing !!! Seriously every time I watch any video of yours I do my makeup haha you're my motivation honestly !!
Mine is a skin product but I never need any moisturizer or primer in the morning. It's called HA5. It's amazing. Takes my dark circles and puffiness away! Makeup lays beautiful over it!
lol "the fricken gorgeous" @ 12:52 😂😂😂😂 💛 you Jac !!!
lol I'm still here doing my list for Sephora xx
I could watch 45 mins of Jaclyn every day and be perfectly content 😅
JAC!!!!! Please hit us up with that hair tut😍😍😍😍
That Dior foundation is everything I recently got it during the VIB rouge sale and OMG I'm obsessed!! Love this video!!
Am I the only one who'd watch this even if it was 1,5 hour long video? Like girl.... I cant get enough. The longer, the better (that's what she said)
i love u so much but i don't have time for this BUT I CAME THRU W THE THUMBS UP
You are soooooo funny! Girl you made my day! Thank you so much!
I adore your passion and your enthusiasm.  I feel like I'm sitting on my bed with a girlfriend surrounded by make up and we're just gushing together about what we love when I watch your videos.  Much love!
ride or die. Tartlette in the bloom pallete. I bought it after you taught me how to do a warm smokey eye haha 💖 Love you Jaclyn all the way from New Zealand x

I love the  Kat Von D setting spray! I swear it keeps my makeup on forever
I'm OBSESSED with the Tarte Tariest mascara!! You have to try it, Jaclyn, it's so amazing. Love you!!
my new favorite is the lancome juicy shaker in berry in love and i just picked up the new matte shaker in the fushia ( i cant remember the name) but damn that is p.i.g.m.e.n.t.e.d
Jaclyn would you be able to do an entire face tutorial from start to finish for like under 80 to 100 dollars with product you like?
Girl if you love the colourpop satin lips try the shade Tiny Chum. It's the hello kitty line, I've been wearing it almost everyday for like a month it's gorgeous
Like what the fuck.....(bleep)😅😂😂
Wow people are so fucking rude. She's literally just talking about makeup she likes and people still have shit to criticize.. like are you bored? Go somewhere else.
BH Cosmetics Matte Liquid Lipstick in Clara is my ride or die!
"WHERE ARE MY NUDES?!?!" 😂😂😂😂
So worth the wait!
Your favourites videos are by far one of the best favourites videos on youtube lol
"WHAT THE FUCK" 5 mins later.. *beep*
I desperately need a tutorial on this look! I know you mention the products you used as you showed them in the video, but OMG, it is perfect!
The hair color omg!!! it looks amazing. Now i am only shopping thank you lol!!
What's the champagne pop that you put on your shoulders and collar bones, you say it at the end of the video?? Love the look <3
I can't afford most of this makeup but I love how excited Jaclyn gets about makeup!
I watched the whole video of courseee. Estée Lauder double wear is my ride or die because I have the most oily skin, it lasts all day and doesn't get me shiny but the colour range isn't the best xxx
When is your Morphe Pallette coming out so it can be one of my favs :) cus i know it will be <3 Love your makeup look in this video. YOU LOOK BOMB
New favorite of mine right now is the Lorac Pirates of the Caribbean Cheek Palette! So buttery and soft!
Love the Stila gliters but i do have some fall out, any tips to prevent fall out ??
please share your necklace info
Great content and love your energy! I wish you talked a bit slower though. 😂 What is the deodorant that she says that she usually uses, anyone? Thanks.
I LOVE your necklace! So pretty. Where'd you get it??
u know jaclyn likes a product when she claps and screams "YAS BITCH"
watching this on my phone while i shop on sephora.com!! about to have a full basket!
Your energy level is so contagious! Love your videos :)
I have the lip balm and it is amazing smells delicious
I got 'omg, she's running out of room for more swatches!' anxiety 😂
Seriously just reading these comments show how disgusting humans can be. Thank you Jaclyn for looking past the bullshit and staying strong❤️
yass babe..
she's got to learn to control her arms & hands ---way too distracting.  it's all I could see while watching her.
I do believe all my leg and arm hairs just grew one centimeter from listening to this performance.
what is the High note that she hit in 2:46, please
The best The Voice winner!
She's a fking magician.Oh yeh cause his last name is Porter.
goosebumps everywhere
The fact that NONE of the judges stood up, really enrages me. Like how????
Jordan is The King n Alisan Is The Queen.. But Only one The Best. He Is Billy Gilman. Its Fact.
OMG! is so beautiful! amazing voice. Best Winner  ❤
Bless this precious woman, not only did she WRITE this song, but she sang the song down out of the HEAVENS!!! You go Alison.
I hear a little bit of Melissa Etheridge in her voice!
Seems like a good song, but too many vocal acrobatics with her voice for me,  makes some of her words hard to understand. Sometimes, less is more.
She is literally the last winner who deserved to win.
She's really amazing
Now that was a beautiful performance. Alisan have such a strong set of pipes.
Sounds great, but unfortunately she looks like she aged more than she should have.
Stage set is so cool
I LIKE! I LOVE TIHS GIRL!
uuu her tan <3 her voice <3
Her voice reach is insane!!
I dont dislike Her,but I only understood half the words and I have perfect hearing.
Her voice is kind of annoying. No hate.
Sorry, her voice seems to have become a bit harsh.
The voice really be messing up careers, totally forgot about her
I miss Xtina so much...
Man she is good!!
Speechless... I think I can related every word of this song. #Brazil
My LOVE I LOVE U
i think it was too mach anoying the high notes were a lot
BEST OF  LUCK ON YOUR JOURNEY. ALISAN.. GREAT JOB..
her and lilie have like almost the same voice
I am a little worried about her, she doesn't look the same. she has lost a lot of weight. I really hope she isn't messing with drugs again
This is phenomenal
dont even remember this woman
Queen is Queen!!! She still Slaying!!!!!!  Amazing Winner😍❤️
No other winner of the voice will even compare to her
This song is so amazinggggggg touch my spirit in a special way, You are indeed gifted!!! Thank You for writing this song!!
this song sucks as much as season 10 winner
Beautiful song beautiful singer... to bad her foundation was two shades to dark. Not hating just an observation trolls :-P
She is as awesome as ever. Bluebayou is so freaking amazing whenever i see her i remember the blind auditions  love you alisan
1:12 sounds like a coach turned their chair haha
Her voice is really amazing! 😍
What a beautiful song... :)
She is The Best Voice  Winner.  Top 3 Alisan Jordan Tessan
This is currently charting at # 58 on I Tunes. Purchase this song and help Alisan out! This is a great song
WHAT?! I mean, THAT DESERVED A STANDING OVATION!
I love the deep water part where she does the runs so cool
And that's how she robbed Hannah Huston.
Awesome song
those high notes
Ugh..!! So amazing can't wait to hear more
Bravoooo ALISAN !...BRAVOOO ! ..hugsss from Romania ! <3
Your voice is perfect and you are perfect too, i'm so proud of you Alisan💏💏💏💏great song
Great song for her vocal range...love it
Great performance her voice is stunning , love the emotion she gives to her songs . Such a strong voice as well
That's a winner! Wow!
She is Effin DOPE!!!! I love her still!
Beautiful song, suits her voice so well ! Good to hear you again Alisan.
So Where Do I Vote For Her ❤😂 Lol She Can Definitely Win 2 Seasons
Alisan put on some extra self-tanner in respectful tribute to Xtina.
I LOVE IT!!!
Wonder if she could win against Sundance and Billy
i love this girl ! she's so amazin
Slayed my life
She is better than all judges. !! And They didn't stand up for her. 🙈
Still flawless as ever
excellent!!! I miss her voice in the show
Hi I'm Egypt gentry and I'm 8 years old and I love ❤️ your show and I have an amazing voice so please just think about putting me on your show please
*when she screams. she sounds like a dying squirrel*
*she is nothing compare to jordan smith*
She looks like a bit Jade Thirlwall.
her voice is still amazing but her hands are terribly annoying.
someone please tell me why I thought that was Michelle Obama in the thumbnail for a good 2 seconds??
Chris Blue doesn't want any of Alisan Porter!
The best performer to be on this show!
Wow. She's better than Beyonce, Carrie Underwood, Kelly Clarkson, Rhianna, Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey, and Justin Bieber.
Great song!   Oh!  Where the hell is Chris Blue's  performance of  " When a Man Loves a Woman" ?
In all honesty though, she would win again this season. lol
We have the same last name only she sounds a million times better than me that's for sure
Wow, none of the coaches stood up for her. To me, that was pretty rude.
Really cool superheroes. A gun way to learn!
GOHAN is BACK! I am sooo happy about this 😄
Damn it chi chi will you just admit you got it on with piccolo
His hair spike is back
Again who gives a toddler a knife
How you get this?
piccolo is really a good teacher
who cares if gohan is mystic we already saw that krillen and 17 is as strong as ssb goku LOOOOL
I hope everyone knows that tien is a triclops and isn't human this battle will be lit
this shit is trash
i think that gphan will win the tourniment
BRING BACK THE "Kill you? No. I want to erase you."
A GIRL SAIYAN!!!
Saw my video about you?
Could you please upload episode 80 t0 87..i cant find the FULL videos on youtube
finally gohan is back
hi my name is kunal plz I am requesting you to translate the db super all videos in english
I guess they really like the pokemon rattata
Poor dino ;c  His tail will grow back...
whis in on it  no one will be destroyed. since when does whis try to desuade Beerus from upsetting a human lol
Bulla is just the sweetest! Even her hair makes me laugh 😇
That moment when the kid inside you comes out -13:03 lol
I bet you vegeta is gonna love cauliflas personality 😂🙌🏼
Does anyone ship uub/ pan or pan / trunks ?
6:50 No sex tonight Krillin.
why didn't they get pikkon he would have been a good fighter
DODGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"He's goku son he can't be beat".
Vegeta knows how to do with babies?????? How could it be???????
FUCK YEA MYSTIC IS BACK
U are not as legendary as me
Gohan in goku clothes getting beaten up by a namekian... Power levels in this new dragon ball are completely ruined.
Gohan.I Thought U Were Back But..Still...There Is One More Thing Left To Learn LEARNING TO FUCKING DODGE !!!!!
The real Gohan is back!!!
Pretty good episode if Gohan can learn his lesson from cell and evil buu he'd actually be maybe the strongest. But he doesn't like fighting like normal saiyans.
i like Gohan having a  different power than the other peopz, mystic Gohan with just his normal(that one strand of hair plus) looks! his father Piccolo really knows how to train Gohan!
feel bad for the guy waiting for goku... hes just not wanted =(
Who's 'Caulifla'? Her name is pronounced 'Karifura' in Japanese, so the correct translation should be Kalifla or Califla :o
Love that they have this episode to show picollos true strength
I wouldn't mind 17 and 18 fused!!! Then it would bring that *SUPER 17*
at 15:35 it looked like he's transforming super sayain first time
They say  That a thousand moons passed  Before   The day when Gohan grabbed his balls back  Was in sight...  Tho he still didn't dodge
Gohan:I can fight,i can punch,and i am strong!! Yamcha:but you can't catch an earring! Gohan:Fuck You!
I could've swore there's been 3 nights in these 40 hours so far
am I the only one thinking that krilln voice is Luffy ???
#Mystic4life
Btw guys did anyone notice that piccolo actually killed gohan. He was forced to restart his heart and he even commented that he'd be strangled to ''death'' lol.
I think people are forgetting the fact how strong and far piccolo has become. So happy to see hogan turn back to his mystic form
poor yamucha
For some reason I imagine gohan fighting yamcha and losing ;-; I would be so disappointed.
Android 17 is bullshit. How can you become as strong as super saiyan god from nit even killing poachers
Why tf do voice actors make that sound when they fight. ...."TATATATATA...LALALALAL...RARARARARA"
caulifla confirmed that she is the female version of broly
loved seeing gohan turn ss2 effortlessly shit was lit
her got his fringe again I'm so happy he was so ugly before next is teen ssj2 hair
When a namekian is stronger than you.   I wanna cry
why dont they just keep repeating this process to the saiyans and keep critically injuring them then just keep letting them eat senzu beans just keep repeating that the saiyan ability will work
someone please edit the training scenes with piccolo and every time he lands a punch on gohan put I  a clip of him screaming dodge
ahhhh gohan is mystic again im screaming
gohan had to stop being a bitch and train hard
Who's gonna help that guy at the end train though? Anyone? Anyone at all? Come on Roshi, we know you ain't busy, come train with Yamcha!
Whats theme at 18:50?
Ahaahahah!  The Trex lost its tail!  Same thing happened to another Trex, a nod to Gohans' earlier training!
guys i just thought of the craziest thing what if the universe 7 first and legendary super saiyan god was banished to universes 6. imagine that
has cabba been mystic the entire time
I've been waiting on this day. A fresh air I can breathe now that Mystic Gohan is back. 👏👏👏👏
God Mystic form confirmed
hehehe, thats funny, Yamcha, that you think Goku will invite you to the ToP
why did she marry krillin now her kids will be half midget
17:24 I almost thought piccolo was about to say "forget him I'm your father now"
My baby really backkk and they hinting and maybe giving him another form omg !!😍
Gohan you brought back the hairstyle
FINALLY A EPISODE THAT MAKES SENSE
theory GOHAN WILL GET KNOCKED OUT IN THE TOURNEMT OF POWER AND VIDEL AND PAN WILL SEE THEN VIDEL AND PAN SAY WERE COUNTING ON YOU like in episode 74 AND WHEN HE HERES IT GOHAN WILL GO CRAZY AND GO ULTIMATE BLUE GOHAN
Im so used to watching dbs in japanese dub, like sometimes i dont even notice it in japanese
of they ain't got the hypersonic loin tamer then this show will probably become a little lamer
great episode but poor yamcha
Why doesnt buu just absorb hit and beat everybody at the tournament
Piccolo is a basass
Wth are these DODGE memes lmao
Poor Garbage ass Yamcha.
if weighted piccolo is equal to ssj gohan, then gohan is really weak right now. (or piccolo got really strong.)

Fuck bulls, I care about people.
STOP ANIMAL SLAVERY!!!!
FUCK THE SPANISH FUCKS THAT STILL BULLFIGHT AND ATTEND THAT SHIT. As a Hispanic that shit makes me FURIOUS.
Disgusting "tradition"...
Great video. Sickening practice. Maybe we can get all of Spain's bull fighters, all of Britain's fox hunters and put them on a big ship in the middle of nowhere next time North Korea want to test another missile.
Bro wtf he jabs it in and just fucking wiggles it in there and you can see the animal in so much fucking pain
Raptor isntand of bulls? THAT FREAKING AWESOME!!!!
Raptors are more fun than bulls so......SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
This makes me so mad, that I could fight a bull.
Lol, So Many SJW
if only angry reacts existed on Youtube
Did Michael Bay directed this video or what?
that's ridiculous
It's one thing to kill animals in a sustainable way and as quick as possible for FOOD. This is just cruel and disgusting.
Made it the petition in english also
WTF is wrong with those raptors? Did they pluck them before sending them into the arena?
Spanish people as violent, primitive and intolerant and rude as always. Primitive people. Deport them.
Thats why we don't have dinossaurs anymore :'(
Top of the food chain kids. Nothing to see here.
I wonder how many of Bullfighting critics drink milk. A daily act that inflicts much more suffering.
This comment section has become a place to hate on Spain and spaniards...
and you infidels said islam is the savages?
Stop NASCAR, they pollute, leave this sport alone,
its a fair fight. bulls need to evolve and hit the target instead of hitting the red cape everytime.
This velociraptor looks more convincing than the ones in later Jurassic Park movies.
Yeah... this bullshit is still legal.
if someone would fight a fucking raptor, i would watch that shit
I disagree with animal bloodsport, but am mostly here to point out those dinos should have feathers. Good PSA, though.
This practice doesn't belong in any age.
fucked up people with their fucked up traditions.
It's culture, don't you leftists love multiculturalism?
Who gives a shit, it's a dumb animal.
don't really see the problem here.
this is real, it escaped from ken hams ark
fuck you!!! that shit is awesome!!! if anything needs to be stoped is the making of these dumb ass videos. bleeding heart pussies.
Why at 54 have I never seen them killing the bull?  I was lead to believe it lived.
where can I see the original
You can easily tell it's fake. No Raptador would be caught wearing teal & pink.
is there a link to the petition that's in english?
These Spaniards are sub human
Uh, you have managed to completely change my mind on this subject. We should do it more often! This is badass!
whys the petition in Spanish?
What about restoring Rome tradition of throwing Christians to lion's pit? Sounds great, yes?
This old bullshit traditions should be already gone as well as religion ..
The first part is the faked one and the last is what it actually happend that time.
You need to be fucking retarded to think the raptor is real
The dinosaur one is just photoshopped. But the bull one is real.
None of this would have ever happened had he been born a female.
some countries are mad they dont have a rich culture (america) haha.
this is really well done but you should have cgi'd an animal people cam actually relate to lole dogs
This is why I am overcome with joy and elation when a bull brutally gores one of them ballerinas..
Damn this is some top notch matte and CGI work. Please do a behind the scene video for this.
WE EAT ANIMALS EVERYDAY AND YOU THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM?
for a country that's in the EU....
Actually raptors would have just been a little larger than chicken's. This must have been Photoshop.
I thought they cut off the bull's head with a sword. Damn, now I know what spaniards have high unemployment. They are idiots.
funny how this species of Bull would be extinct like the raptor, if there was no bullfighting. also they are treated better than normal cattle
That was awesome. Unfortunately I think I now support bullfighting. Great sport.
Yea bull fighting sucks, but instead of making me want bull fighting less, all this video did was make me want raptor fighting more.....
We could mount spike helmets on them when they do the run with the bulls, to even the playing field until we can end the fights
This is a perverted sich sport practice
This "sport" is for pussies. Go in there with your bare hands or don't go in at all.
Sounds like the makers of this video are Animal Supremacists.
I don't accept and say veganism is for stupid cunts, but this thing (corrida) is fuckin bullshit and should be criminal... How animal torture can be entertainment?
That was awesome! We need to revive dinosaurs just for that! :-)  Thanks for the video! You made my day!
I want to watch this corrida with velociraptors!
I wanna see the raptor fight the bull!!1!
Americans want to ruin everything but just try saying something they do is bad and they go ape shit.
Lol why someone would CGI bulls over raptors?
this "sport" makes humans look bad
this is why its great when the people die or get injured badly.
nice propaganda, reddit
> Implying a human is quicker than a velociraptor
wow i had no idea. very powerful ad and completely changed my opinion on bull fighting.
You misspelled FAG
Time for a steak :)

Being a fashion photographer is CRAZY
I'm Phil Focus and this Bruce guy is so in denial gay.  .kwim gang?
Thats because he started smoking weed at 30 years old
I don't put film in the camera, but I sure GORILLA fuck them!!!
Fashion Photography by day, Podcast by night... all day...
It's odd how I was thinking of typing the same thing. 
Powerful Bruce Testones
I never use film in my camera.
great assssssssssssssssss
why did they do that  to Munchie not this Gabriel AKA Moruti wa tsotsi
Isidingo is having Sechaba pulling the same traumatic acts as Obakeng-that is un-creative!
Majola is hot kodwa
I love the way kgothalo is placing Gabriel in his position,,,,thanks for the upload
the person responsible for Kgothalos make up i think they are now doing it over the limits
Sechaba is another Leshole now L
Those 2 who did this to Setjhaba they need umphakathi before they hand them over to the police bloody pigs.
And then this Sangoma guy, what's his name? Well it doesn't matter but eyy uyafana no Ricky rick.
I'm feeling sorry 4 sechaba. ..I agree with lerato. those people must be punished. .
The sangoma guy is a neat freak yhoooo
Now Sechaba is like Obakeng hearing things
Morongwa is my hero, the girl can make me laugh.
i wish our african sistas can realise how beautiful they are without these weaves that make dem look like freaks.
Sechaba if you see things just follow Obakeng to traditional doctor
can someone explain to me why Munchie is behaving like that,,,,like seriously
Simnandi isiXhosa sika Majola but he's an annoying detective..
that morongwa's accent "Watch me"😂
can't we have majola on igazi , I love his xhosa lingo marn
can't we have majola on igazi , I love his xhosa lingo marn
Only in South Africa where private detectives have access to cell keys
Sechaba's situation hurts. He is nothing but nice to everyone, he is always laughing and this happens to him. Life sure isn't fair.
😂😂😂😂😂 rongwas
police bae is back
Im proud of how Morongwa represents xhosas.....
Is it true that these tortures like one Sechaba got still happen in south Africa?  I'm very sorry for you guys if so... We love you all the way from Tz
IsiXhosa sikaMorongwa Though
So can any1 tell me what the problem is with this late uploading??? It's getting really annoying

I'm not really into the whole breakdancing thing but c'mon...that was brilliant....just the fact that he can move and balance like that!! You don't have to like it, but appreciate the talent....
This is correct.  I often make these sounds Though, they don't always mean these things. They also mean that I am just trying to annoy my human to death
When I hear my cat yowl it means that any second a hairball is about to come up.
So there are two meanings as to why a cat yowls:  "Fuck off!"  "Fuck me!"
Today I heard growling cat for first time, and i had 5 cats in my life. Lol so many cats and i never made any one of them pissed off enough to growl :D
0:31 My cat is making this one constantly
Cats are my favorite pet.
well my cat is quite all the time
Adult cat "meow" can mean:  "open the door" "pet me" "I need food or water" "your houseplants are too high" "my litter box is disgusting"
My little cat was so distraught when she heard the kittens meow, she went crazy looking for the 'kittens' haha
Congrats to all you views on this video!!!!!! Wow!!!
when my cat is growling or hissing i always hug him and he calms down
Excellent video!!! I love cats and all of the wonderful sounds that they make, and so much more!! Question... why was the tuxedo kitty so upset?
I knew all of them. I speak cat language!
what cat sounds mean purring -- feed me yowling -- feed me growling -- feed me chattering -- feed me trilling -- feed me  hissing -- feed me meowing -- feed me
Thank you 👍 for this sharing.  All the best for you! ─ :)
That cat really wants too keep that remote...   =(^_^)=
Are you making your kitty mad on purpose just to get this video!?  That's so mean!
Yowling can also mean "I want attention"
omg that cat's purr is sooooo cute 💕
Trilling is my favorite. It's so adorable.
purring can also mean stress under certain situations.
"I want to mate " and "I don't want you comming around my place" are the same meow?  mixed messages man =/
***HEADPHONE USERS BEWARE***: when the video approaches the "meow" TURN THE AUDIO DOWN OR YOU WILL GO DEAF
Humans aren't supposed to purr, right?
there is a meow my cat uses when I get out of bed. he seems so friendly but really hes trying to get me to follow him to the food bowl 😂
i've noticed our cats use the trill noise to call their kittens.
Don't know why this was on my recommended list don't even watch animal videos.
man that angry one doesn't want anybody touching his remote.
some cats trill when they're growling/hissing too
On a cold day my cat would sit on the heating vent and then proceed to complain when his ass got too hot.  It was an angry "meh" sound.
Think # 2 is also pre hairball vomit.
my cat at meal time: NOW NOW NOW NOW
all wrong. you got this all wrong. you should meet snake the cat.
I want to watch this video, but my dogs are going nutz!!!!
What about when cat's bark?  Like an actual bark?  As in sounding like a dog bark?
yoel  mine is just asking why I am  when they do that    frowling  keep away
when they meow if u pet them and stop its like they ask for more is all
as per my experience with cats and kittens , they tend to change depending upon how you raise them not all cats do the same except purring as its naturally occurring !
My cat (a mother of 4 litters and a now retired queen) lost her mind when I was watching the end of this video.  She was looking for the kittens!  I had to turn off the speakers.  T_T
some say cats chatter to mimic the sound of the birds
already knew all of this thanks for wasting my time
My cat trills when I grab him kinda unexpectedly. I doubt it's a friendly greeting then, more like a "Hey!" and it sounds a little darker. I do it all the time because it's fun.
already knew all this. thanks for wasting my time.
my cat has a word for water. atrow is what he says when he is out of water.
At 0:55 that cat wasn't letting his/her owner watch tv
Cats are just cool. Period.
*gasp* KITTY!
Omg the yowling cat was soooooooo funny!!!!! Hahaha!!! 😂
my cats are freaking out right now hearing all these cats lol
One thing that can be important for owners that note is that cats may randomly purr when in distress or when they are just stressed out. However, this is only rare.
I think the spitting sound was accidentally left out. My cat makes this sound toward our kitten all day long. Today was the first time I didn't hear him make it in the last month. 
I eat pussy
My cat trills at me when I come near her. She also yowls when I'm gone.
Interesting video, my cat "talks" to me when he wants something or when I come home from work after a double shift and he thinks that we have to bond . 😸
growling actually means I love you face please bring it closer
1:02 who else is doing motorcycle hand motions?
Such a cute video! One thing to note also is that cats can sometimes purr out of pain :( I suppose it's equivalent to a human's moan, in a way? ........ And seriously those kittens were too adorable! <3
My cat doesnt yowl, growl, or chatter, but does everything else /:
i have a cat and when she's on my lap, she looks up at me and purrs as i pet her. her loving face tells me she enjoys my attention.
Actually, cats purr to regenerate themselves
My cat makes the trill noises all the time it's adorable
My cat went straight to my phone when I played it aloud on it HA
My cat trills and purrs a lot when I'm around. He's very vocal.
I think the yowl can also mean "where the hell is everybody....I'm lonesome". Certainly several of our Siamese and Siamese mixes have used it that way.
I missed the sound of: "I'm sorry", "help"
my cat makes bird noises while running at top speed around the house what does it mean?
My cat who was sitting on my legs while watching the video freaked out at the yowl sound
My cat is always chattering. I always call it chirping though. My kitty Nylah always does that to a reflection of a phone and if prey is there. I call her Chirpy now xD
my cat says HELLO! and BYE BYE! sooo....
#2 Sooo...What I need to do?  Fuck my cat?
My dogs and cats are looking for the kittens that are meowing at the end of the video! Hehe
yowling cat sounded like he was sayinh "hello"
Dogs are better
cats purr cuz they are in telepathic contact with bastet, the egyptian cat god
I adopted an 8 year old cat about a year ago and this was very helpfull.  Your cat is such a sweetie and a lot of the sounds she/he makes are quite soothing. i want to watch it again because it is so sweet.
The yowling part freaked out my parents and our cats...
Yowling can also be followed by vomiting, so it could also mean "I feel sick".
Love watching the video, but cats don't only purr when happy.  They also purr if in pain or scared... so...
My cat chatters constantly. He hears the birds in the morning and wants to hunt.
Interesting. My cat skips the growling and goes straight to hissing when she's angry or threatened .
Your video is absolutely amazing! We would love to write up a story on it and feature it in an article. Please email me at arueda@littlethings.com
when you watch this with your cat and he looks around and looks at you with the look of " What sorcery is this?"
My cat was freaking out as I was listening to this video.
8 : the NO sound
My uncle dipped a stray cat in gasoline and lit in on fire once for the 4th of july. I miss my uncle r.i.p.
yowl: let's fuck or get the fuck away
My cat yowls sometime when she wants in my room when I have the door closed.
Congrats you made it into the dutch trending spot 8

Regular Season game with playoff game 1 title! This game was on April 10th. Dislike to make this go away.
Man idgaf about the fake/real shit as long as I get to see these highlights it don't Matter to me I'm out .✌🏼
IT is unbelievable!
OKay I wanna hear some Talkshits from Bulls and Wiz fans.....The Leprechaun always feed on your Sack of Salts and Tears.  OK bring it on I wanna hear some Super Salty shits LOL
This is a fake channel
damn, they lit!!!! youtube "Daddy mikey - street wars" and just thank me later....
Look at the very beginning. He did walk right?
That nigger with dreads can really shoot the three
Gortats gotta put his hands up when hes in his own paint man
Before, we have the Truth, now we have The Tooth
if boston meets cavs in finals, for sure 4-0 for cavs,do you think thomas can control the power of the king?what do you think guys?
How come when u look up the NBA schedule for Boston and Washington, it says Game 1 then Game 3 ? Where is game 2 WTF
Celtics Vs Warrios in finals in June!!!!!!!
so this game was like whoever was the better 3 point shooting team was the winner
Like if Isaiah Thomas is the real MVP
What a Good Adquisition on Horford! Celtics in 5!
The opening segment advertises the fact that you're a fake channel...
celtics or warriors will be the 2017 champs
warriors boston is the final
Fuck this fake channnel
today we saw The Truth retired but the future of Boston is here Isaiah Thomas a.k.a. THE TOOTH!!!
Fake channel!
fake channel
i hope celtics are going to the finals, i'm tired to see lebron went to the finals every year
I saw the score 20something to 5 and I thought it was a lost cause. When I saw the W later on I was shocked!! Celtics baby!!
i is thomas thomas here i come
I'm so confused about the "fake" accounts intro
BANG! > BINGO
Fuck the wizards... we bout to win the next 3. I like how everybody was trying to make a meme out out "brad stevens is 2-8 in the playoffs" bitch gtfo consider him 10-10 now
that 3 ball is now every teams life's blood.  the game has evolved so much
the best game ever boston nation!
crowder was coming up big
Celtics in 6 the Celtics have way to much fire power for Washington
celtics in 4
There is a big difference between having mike breen as a play by play announcer and having the normal celtics dude as the announcer. Just love his voice and reactions
shouts out to Jaylen Brown coming off the bench and making a good 7 points in the 4th
no way boston can shoot this amazing from 3 all series. washington is too physical, consistent and talented. Wiz in 7.
Idc wall almost broke Thoma's ankles
This it fake ximo pierto everyone unsub for him
isn't the top search this channel though? look at the number of subscribers
general NBA rule: if a team is ahead 15 points early, they'll lose the game.
We going beat the wizards because of our defense and coaching should go 5 or 6
Every time Horford leads the Celtics in assists and Thomas leads in points, they win. But either way, the Cavs are going to destroy who ever wins this series if they are going to play this poorly.
Well sad story for shit boston' cavs gonna fucked them up every year sooner or later so conf. semi or final thats the story
With Morris being hurt I think Bogdanovic is gonna get more minutes. He could be the X factor, he has real fire power
Wizards just channeled their inner GS to blow a 20 point lead
fuck this fake ass channel
This is going to be veeeeeerrryyy interesting
BORING!all they do is shoot threes.not the way the game is meant to be played
Thomas is a beast!
Does anyone know what video starts RIGHT BEFORE the tip off ? The video where it gets you all hype up before the game starts. I don't know if you know what video I'm talking about
The Wizards use their Magic to lose this game..
If I hear that HUMBLE Beat one more time...
at 7:08 left in the fourth, the foul supposedly committed should be reviewed and the ref that called it should be fined for clear ignorance. That was pathetic.
why the fuck did i miss this game like it looks so fun with high level offense
will we ever find out the actual Ximo Pierto Channel?
Wizards are the only team in the NBA where if you change the W in their name to an L ( as people do a little too often nowadays) ,  it still remains a real word : Lizards - Wizards  I just wanted to share that
This nigga put up a video where it says his channel is a fake channel. And no fcuks were given.
Isaiah Thomas vs John Wall...This playoff series is going to be legendary.
Finaking fake channel
they got lucky next round it'll be over.
Yeah we might not light it up like that for 3s again all series but we also won't be down 16-0 again either so stfu.
only if rondo was in
Wizards have a dope squad & coach. They'll bounce back. This series might go 7 games.
3 points😂😂😂
Boston got lucky Bradley and crowder will never shoot that good again Wizards will win in six games
lol this is sad. Whoever LeBron faces in the ECF is going to be no challenge
This is easily bostons best offensive game, they wont replicate this again so good luck to them.
Going with Washington
fuck boston.
al horford the best..
Thomas>westbrook
Dont subscribe here, this is a fake channel!
Yal ready to put some respeck on my celtics
washington who
Honestly I would give up crowder and smart 2 try n land a primary scorer like Paul George
lets be honest! who ever wins the Raptors vs Cavs series is going to finals!
wizards in 7, this will be exciting
20 point leads don't mean jack in the playoffs.
Wow they blew that lead in the start real quick
let me guess... its cause Rondo got injured?
1 like = Respect to IT4, a little man with a big heart....
The Washington GIZZARDS  lose as expected.  Boston wins this in 6 games
Isaiah Thomas is to good much respect for his game ..
this is fake account guys
Not sure if I'm watching on ximo real channel or a fake one
brick wall cant win bruh lmao lets go celtics
bradley was so good...
May the fourth be with you
urgant show is the russian jimmy fallon show
when he "because we love you" makes my balls cringe
Cannot sing
Why is he thanking her? Always fawning over actors on these type of shows, pathetic. It's the writers who deserve ALL the credit
Hey Jimmy, do your research before you "interview".
Oh girl I loved u since back in the day in 8 simple rules .. fkn hottie 🔥👌🏼
She's really hot
Video starts at 3:45
I feel like I know the cast
Her boobs are getting change every season.
What's the name of the song 2:10???
Always a cutie... besides that last question --- wtf? People are so odd!
She's very bright and energizing. I love it
Good Show i Like it ;d
The video is almost 5 minutes long so I expected her to sing the whole song, not just the part they use for the intro...
Is she wearing a gay peacock from Vegas?
Yet she makes 1 mil an episode hahaha.
that was so adorable!
script much
lord, can she not sing! :-D but she always blew up "soft kitty" so we all knew. :-))  i do love her btw.
What's with her hair?  Did she just fall out of bed?
10/10 would bang (no pun intended)
10 years of utter mediocrity.
my ears are bleeding
love this show!
I ❤️ The Big Bang Theory So much! Greetings from Hungary. Have a nice day😉🙌🏻
may the fourth be with us. Always.
She is one of the two girls I know blooming with age.
I mean, try not to sing along!    I was right, you couldn't.
They're tripping about 220+ episodes 😂 go watch naruto or one piece
Alaska Thunderfuck anyone?
Is that a curtain stitched up into a dress?
Oh god, she's completely tone deaf.
she's been bae for a decade now love kaley
Did the show get better after season 4/5? Because thats when it went to shit and I stopped watching. But gotta milk the cash cow as long as possible, cant blame them
That show is shit lol.
that's a pretty mouth, but it ain't made for singing.
4:28 wait why is that dude holding a stuffed squirrel?! Lmao
Totally not staged, faked and stuff
Gosh, this is so scripted.... I miss Craig.
Kaley acts like Jennifer Aniston.......what a ripe off.
"...Neanderthals developed tools, WE BUILT A WALL!..." And Mexico paid for it
The laugh track on that show drives me crazy.
I used to hate her when she plays billie on charmed season finale, but i love her so much after S1 big bang theory
That's pretty cute... The way Kaley sing the title song of #BigBangTheory
What's the song that they are singing at 2:15?
*Hahaha I don't know what I've been doing for 9 seasons!* - Uhm, cashing in? yea that was it
Love this woman, she's so bouncy.
Stopped watching after she got the lesbian haircut
I think one of the writer's assistants has lesbian feelings for Kaley. You can't not be in love with someone and get shots like that every time.
She's so fit ain't she
I know people say the show has gone downhill, but I thought this season was hilarious. I love it.
the big bang theory is so fucking shit now
is it me or she has a 'Rachel from Friends' feel in this clip: idk her expressions and gestures...or maybe it's just me lol!!
I know the whole song. Even the bits we don't hear in the programme 😂😂😂
love her!! who else?
so that episode when Sheldon and Leonard didn't want to watch penny perform was infact her real singing voice. bbt fans would know
Lol the questions were planned...
Lmao can't stop laughing
So this was the cutest segment ever
I could go for a hot cup of Cuoco right about now.
I love her even more now cos she actually remembered the show's lyrics LOL  True patriot to the show ;) She's so lovely
Kaley is one of my hot girl crushes lol and big bang is my life.
Is everything so planned in this show? People asking questions are really bad actors...
What If Jimmy Fallon Has To Interview With A Cartoon Character?
I FINALLY KNOW THE WORDS TO THE BIG BANG THEORY THEME! 😂 the only part I could understand was "we built the pyramids!" Lmao I guess it went too fast for me or something 😂😂😂 I FINALLY KNOW IT! YAY
our whole universe's been in a hot dense state...
litle cat song, please
i want her!
Is that Jian Yang (Silicon Valley) in the audience
The Guy seems drunk
kaley is not a singer but she has the Rythm so she could be a drummer lol She's cute
How can someone look THAT good in EVERY GOD DAMN PICTURE! :(
was I the only one singing along with her?
she is so sweet 😍😍
4:07, for those who dont wanna watch the rest of the video
Yep Kaley killed it singing the *The Big Bang Theory Song* Oh My....
The singing part was staged.. but, she is hot, funny and awesome... so who cares?
I wonder how many of the other stars from TBBT can also sing the theme song if they know it.
I would have asked her to sing soft  kitty 😂😂
It took a good few minutes until they got to the song but I think the wait was worth it.
song at 2:10 ??
I know the girl who got her to sing the theme song
That is so staged it might deserve a Tony
I'm just gonna guess she's on a heap of Percocet!
she is adorable
she looks so much better with long hairs
she was looking at the teleprompter when singing .. my friend who was at the show told me
did it really turn into a poptart and Cheetos and mams
never thought i would one day watch a man named guava juice saying "THIS GIRL IS GOING TO BE ME"
What is a pop tart???
I saw that video 📹 for nothing I wanted to see the cake 🎂
4:04 you spin the head rigth round, right round when you go or when you go round round.

If the m&m tasted like blueberrys the. Why did the chettos tast like m&m with pop tart?
Make a vid with Logan Paul/Jake Paul like if you agree 💖😘
Hmmm is there such thing as white chocolate brownies ?

Guava Juice, you should actually show what happens after
More reasons to come to Japan. <3
OMG until when is this Bigbang thing in this amusement park?
Oh yay, I've been there back in 2010. So much changed! I'll be in Tokyo again in 2 weeks, maybe I'll give it a visit again.
That place looks super fun! It's good to see Greg around, the three of you looked like you had a good time. 😋
idk why but it scares me how quickly the world is changing ( in a good way ) love the vlog though !!
Ahhhh the halfpipe ride was my favorite!!!!! I went on so many times 💖💖💖
When Gregg was using the scanner I couldn't help but think "Gregg what does the scouter says about its power level" :P
so much to do i wouldn't be able to do all of it very cool
I kind of want to know how she does that style of hair bun ._.
I wish I knew about this when I was in Tokyo!! Would be riding on the Initial D cars all day.
Wow that Amusement Park looks so cool * - *  Awesome Vlog :)
Growlithe Plushie! I need it.
Been loving your cute hairstyle!
Been there it's amazing
Looks so fun! :) The prizes in claw machines in Japan are amazing! Most of the UK ones have pretty poor prizes... although Pokemon have slowly made a come back! (Not that it matters, nobody ever wins!!)
That was  resident evil 7 biohazard simulator ?
Eeveelutions <3
Greg is so cute please tell him i love him
i have a super weak stomach, i can't do any rollercoasters or tummy twisting rides... can u tell me some rides etc, that are safe for my poor tummy? ^^'  i'm going to tokyo in June :3
I want to go straight away
I went to that amusement park! I thought it was just a mall and stumbled upon it by accident and it was awesome.
OMG THE NEKO ATSUME soooooo cute
Greg should've worn matching stripes too, haha
I think it's better indoors I think you don't have to walk that much as an outdoor one
omg! gara gara go!? (the first bigbang song i ever heard/got me into kpop years ago...)
That place look like a lot of fun. Unfortunately I missed out on Joypolis when I was in Japan. Planning to go back there in July, are you perhaps interested in singing some karaoke with me if so Sharla? :D
Is this the one in DECKS where there's also a retro mall area?
I loved joypolis, me and my husband went there and got to go trough the Resident Evil 7 mansion :D
When I went to Joypolis that rollercoaster was a zombie horror one where we had to shoot all these zombies as it went along. Didn't know it changed theme that's cool! Will have to go again 😁
Wish i could go there...
I literally cried watching this cause I wish Big Bang events/stuff was so readily available in the US. I can dream.... I need to meet Daesung 🖤🖤🖤
I like Craig. I'm glad he's back
I don't know why but my favorite vlogger is sharla! Shes very kind and im always excited everytime she has a new upload
I want to go there so bad!!!
I love that halfpipe ride so much it's hilarious
Yessss Greg!!! I can't wait for more videos with him!
You totally missed the cool little details! The neatest was the mens bathroom urinal game and all the interactive art areas!
What they have a smoking section in the indoor amusement park?
OMG that place looks SO cool, I wanna go there sooo bad now!
WTF THAT INITIAL D!? Y IS IT SO GUD!?!? (the game, guys, not when you first wake up in the morning...)
BIGBANG THEMED AMUSEMENT PARK
If you got into cars you'd be bigger.
did you not try zero latency vr. i have been to the one in australia and its awsome
We need to spend a whole day there next time! o(^o^)o
have you gone to jump world in ikebukuro? its very similar but its all shonen jump themed!
looks like so much fun!! thank you for the upload sharla! love you!
I was wondering if you played the initial d game if so what car did you choose
I looked forever to find the Toyota from your thumbnail in the vlog! when do I see it?!!
Aww, Greg is super cute! I hope you guys had a lot of fun!
(Excuse my vocabulary but ...) dood that's so fucking sick !
I like Greg, it'd be great if you did more videos with him. Greg >>>>> Einshine (I'm sorry, I just don't like shine)
I'm so jealous 😂 I don't really like roller coasters but god damn a rhythm game attach to it? I'll try it 🙌🏼
Wow fantastic baby.
That place looks so cool, I wanna go!
the park looks awesome 😍 great video as always 😊
omg I need to go here!!!!!! 😍😍😍
Will visit this place next time I returned to Tokyo again..
Great video Sharla!
This place looks like so much fun! I think I'll try to go there when I'm back in Tokyo this fall!
Looks like an awesome place. I wish I could experience the Biohazard 7 attraction, I love the game. I really like your videos with Greg and Nicole.
That's so exciting! I get to go see G-Dragon in July for his solo tour and I'm so excited
Sharla you and your friend matching blouses ? Cute . The place you guy went is pretty cool .
omg that place sounds and looks awesome!!!!
omg i been there, it was soo much fun. makes me want to go back to japan even more now and its almost been a year now since i last visited. thanks so much for sharing 😁😁
Sharla can foreigners become a seiyuu?
Sharla, this is dope!!
How old is that place?
so cool to know that you're a fan of Initial D!
So much fun, and your smile is shining up my room, you are  amazing <3
The Park is mostly for children. I have been there 2 times but the main reason was ZERO LATENCY VR which is the best VR Shooter you can find so far.
Sharla your ridiculously too pretty and cute. Not to mention you also seem sooo fun and intelligent too! #dreamgirl 💘
I'm a simple guy, I see an AE86 and I click.
I wonder if Sharlas fiance wears mascara, powder, and lipstick because ifs pretty common in Korea.
How do you know what videos to post on your main channel or your second channel? Great video btw!!
Need to play that Initial D game!!
I'm not a fan of rollercoasters eithe, I would probably  be playing the video games and lose a lot of money on those pokemon claw machines.
Need to go back again!!!!!!<3
this looks like so much fun! wish i could go back to tokyo for this!
awww greg and nicole r so cute and funny i love ur personalities together :"D
The place looks huge and amazing👍Greetings from Hokkaido🌸
But... but... did you actually race in the Initial D cars?  Because if so... I'm super jealous.
Awe man that Biohazard simulator looked like it would be so cool 😱
I wonder if there are many indoor water parks in Japan as well
Your outfit is so cute!! You are so cute!!
I got the notification while driving home lol.  We have the circus circus here in Vegas that is in door.
This race was absolutely AMAZING to witness live.  The Jamaican crowd was off the chain!! I love America but I fell in love with Jamaica today. Peace all my yellow and green!!!!
this has got to be the worst footage ever.  didnt see the damn race or how it ended
And that's how it's done
im doing this
I love funny Jews. Larry David can have Palestine.
What's the name of the song
What's the name of the song
That seriously sounds like the Wii Sound theme😂
I can see why there married
thats sweet lol
I don't care what anyone says logic is the nicest rapper out there
i did something similar the morning after i lost my virginity the night before.    *WITH A GIRL!*
This is so sweet, i almost got diabetes
Omg I thought it said this is how I broke up with my wife lol
lmao this is great!😂 I can't wait for this new album tomorrow!!🔥
LMAO... this is awesome.
what show is this from tell me quick plezz!!
Fuck that poor piece of shit one time wonder nigger OG Maco
what a fuckin nerd. the bitch is only with u for ur money. piece of shit all lies. trust no bitch!
"You're not going golfing with Jeff."
I want a husband like that when I got married!!!
yoooooo you're a fuckin dork logic, I love it man.
I was just enjoying the music not thinking about hate or anything racist.. saying to myself "Wow! This is such a nice surprise and lovely music". But then there is hate..?
lmao he really had them play the curb your enthusiasm theme
its a nice thing to do.....but whats with the forced anal rape song?
That was freakin AWESOME!
where do I find a man like this
What show is this song from again? I can't remember lll
I thought they would be more of a Game of Thrones fan couple :(
he thought it would be funny
Not sure if people refering to hate comments to cheaply make themselves look like better people, or if YouTube is censoring again. Either way it's a shame.
Serious props man. This is so funny. Cant wait for season 9 this fall!
The flute from Naruto LOL
Oh...he is sooooo getting some! LOL
hes such a nerd
It's a charming idea, and I'm sure his wife is delighted, but that would not do it for me.
She's amazing that smile and da booty. If she wasnt coming down that balcony I would have climbed up that shiit.
he must of married a daddy's girl now he will have to continue to provide more gifts or else face certain end to his marriage.
that's nice 😥
mothafuckas be livin in heaven.
Woke my wife up with my cock today. Making love in the shower for about an hour.  Baby baby
that song is a meme
CCCUUUUURRRBBBBBBBB
this is gay no offence
Af a glance I thought the title said This is how I broke up with my wife on her birthday
This house is not even that "rich" I've seen more with much more value. and so what If he has a nice house?  He earns the money.
You should of played Smash Mouth All Star to set the mood 😉
lmfao what a shitty present wtf is she gonna with that hahahahah what a waste of money stupid half nigger lol
DAAAAAMN THESE PEOPLE GOT MONEY YALL
why is no one telling me what show this is from !!!! i know i've heard it but i can't think of where it's from!!
People complaining about hate comments when there are barely any.
Seems it has become more important to get likes on YouTube than share a moment with your wife. Imagine the purity of that moment without the camera.
money cant buy happiness yeap ...,sure
Rich people have the best stuff
Bobby really the GOAT for this
There's something wrong, i don't see any shoe flying... recast pls...
Am I the only one that can't quite remember what this very familiar song is from?
logic. the rapper who gonna shit on Kendrick lamar 😂 jk they probably gonna team up like batman and robin
If you're the 1% of people reading this i hope you accomplish your dreams. My dream is to become a successful YouTuber
When the music started playing I started choking on my sandwich. I thought it was gonna be Zoey 101 or some shit.
happy bday to her
You set standards to high
I am scrolling down expecting some comments about romantic this is, but I forgot that I am reading comments and all that matters is race.
I can't wait to have a Caucasian house and Caucasian money to do Caucasian activities like this.
I can hate on whoever I want without knowing who they are, thank you very much. Nobody gives a shit about your favorite little YouTube personality.   The dude is awkward as fuck, fitting that CYE is his favorite show.
He got some that night , guaranteed.
Wait till they have kids , all that shit goes down the drain !
This is dumb
Despite all the "response to hate comments" here, I haven't seen a single hate comment. I'm probably not trying enough, but what everyone else is saying sounds like the "h8rs" are everywhere.
The way he ran out of the room was hella funny
Drop more classics  part 2
They're the perfect couple. 😂
that's a piccolo
It must be nice to have a home. 😊
What is the name of this song?
Damn on my golden birthday when I turned 15 my sister pressed an air horn on the outside of my bedroom window and it scared me so much I sharted
What's this song called ?
A wonderful, loving thing done for a guys wife turns the YouTube comments section into a bunch of angry snowflakes talking about white prividlege... incredible
I love this!!!
Reminding me how much I love being poor and economically stuck....america yeah.
So many comments saying there's hate and yet I see no hate, so here is some hate...         :)
I'm a liverpool fan. I obviously hate the sun but if people buy it then they buy it. I wouldn't personally
The sun gonna kill and hurt arsenal fans like they already did to liverpool fans
Well you clearly don't respect the campaign.... This is the shittest apology ever, he's just making every excuse possible. Paul must be so fucked off
Not a gunner, I'm a reds fan, but due to robbies apology he gets a sub from me👍
F u robbie u only care about money liverpool fan respect and treat robbie nicely, look what tottenham did to u and this how u treat back to liverpool fans by making video with the sun
Robbie doesn't have to explain himself. I bet he won't say nothing to true Geordie fuckin hypocrite.
Robbie owes his loyalty to no one, having him come on video and apologise like this is almost like a way of getting views.
Capitalism working its magic
This sounds like fucking councilling
Got too greedy. Lost respect
So no explanation of what the hell they are talking about! FFS!!!!
In fairness, Robbie has apologised, it is a. Massive mistake, a massive, massive one but he has held his hands up and apologised about it
"Stigma attached to Liverpool fans"?.....other teams fans don't look at LFC fans and have pity on them, nor do they blame them for what happened....it's the LFC fans who keep bringing it up time and time again.
60p? cheapest toilet paper around.
I still buy the sun, I understand the negativity and the campaign but I still buy it, the BBC are also to blame for a lot but you all still watch it
This is the person that puts out a video about being racially abused and then has no empathy when other people have died and been slandered
💰💰💰Lyle, will remember when you come to anfield next year
He can do whatever he wants, so shut the fuck up and mind your own business. Everybody isn't a Liverpool fan.
fuck the sun.. fuck robbie for endorsing them aswell..
Can someone tell me what was wrong with robbies video?
JFT96 NEVER buy the scum
what's with the hate towards the sun? Genuine question btw. I don't actually know anything about the situation.
Paul never gave the brother a chance
Remember A*****l Fan TV isn't allowed at Liverpool's and Everton's grounds and any facilities whatsoever.
So Robbie, did you return e money then? That's something you never made quite clear.
These Liverpool guys are SJW losers.
Will Robbie donate any money made by the video to the families? This should of been addressed.
What sun video?!?!?
What an absolute load of BOLLOX.....LFC are scum n they were the catalyst for the events in SOUTH YORKSHIRE....don't kow tow to the twats.
Since Robbie keeps dodging the question, I'll answer why; Cos of money. He saw $$$ and thought he'd get away with it.
Fair play to Robbie ✌🏼
Fuck off Robbie, gone down in my opinion. Don't pretend to give a fuck.
Racism? Pipe down Paul, getting carried away now
Robbie can do what ever the fuck he wants its got nothing to do with paul
leave man like Robbie alone...he apologizes. If you can't accept his apology then piss off
What video? lol
What was the video about?!?!?
He shouldn't have done it. But it's a mistake at a very stressful time in his life. Don't sit him down and tell him what a cunt he is
i am Arsenal fan and i fucking Hate the sun newspaper
Rob is chatting shit stop blame the Arsenal fan. we do not support you on this.fuck the sun newspaper.Just say sorry.you did this video to get reaction.  I am sure you learned that from your mate Piers Morgan
Sorry why is there a problem with working or buying the sun
Paul I have a question will you stop using SKY if the Murdoch takes over. Cause if you don't then you have basically been angry at Robbie for nothing.
What was in the video?
fuck the s#n what they have done to the city of liverpool and the people and the racists thing they sat
what did the video even show?
What was wrong with it ? Didn't really see it
"Cant give you the reason" it was money, well all know it and it would have taken a real man to say it but clearly Arsenal Fan TV doesn't give a shit about anything other then Arsenal and £, shameful.
The 96 hillsboro tradegy is not only an LFC issue. Its a football issue and fans should all be united in dealing with the s*n. Robbie shouldve known better i.m.o.
paul is going to kill robbie
What happened?
What was in the video? are people angry against the sun or the video in question?
Do not read my name
Robbie did it for one reason only. 💰
FUCK ROBBIE! you wenger in twat, burn in heel for sucking Wenger's dick
The Sun is a vile, vile newspaper, like News of the World who was also vile, some mainstream media in this day and age continues to be sickening all for the sake of money.
Football wankers!
Why support Liverpool ?
Fake news!!! Fuck the press and the SUN in particular
I'm confused on what happened, can someone try and fill me in?
typical scousers winging about the sun Justice for heysel MUFC
Take a look at Robbie's interview post Liverpool vs Arsenal with troops. Listen to what troops says and what Robbie says. He should have known better!!
Loool, I was waiting for the part where Robbie just spoke honestly.  "... listen mate, my wife needs that kitchen extension."
Poor judgement... Your mug mate DT was pictured with a "Don't buy the S*n" sticker on his coat... Didn't stop you making the video with them as Paul said... where's the mindset? ££££
What was the video about? Can someone explain the whole situation?
Robbie, you're a parasite! You and your collection of mongs. Hopefully it won't long until someone rubs the lot of you out, then we can get back to football
#ShunTheS*n
Joe Weller didn't say sorry the fucking nob
Breezy went from cute to perverted real quick @ 3:13. and Sean sound sleepy AF but I like it.

Gas in a ziplock now that's loud n clear. Man this nigga 2 chainz b snappin
THIS SONG IS HILLARIOUS SHIT. SUCH A GAYASS SONG. LOL.... FUCK THIS SHIT DUMB FUCKS
song good but the features verses waay too short only person im hearing alot is 2chains
2 chainz should switch his name in more chainz...
look on utube for "Daddy mikey - street wars" and just thank me later ok?
man this is too lit... name an artist better than jehne aiko or daddy mikey and i'll probably paypal you $30 right now..
They rhyme vibe with vibe. Half the song is them saying vibe.....
This shit knocks.
yo its a vibe guys 
Cisco's Song right here
i remember this song from Midnight Club LA damn
I dont even Mess with Trey Songz like that but his verse gave me a little tingle in the box.
love this song my shit l can keep it on repeat and jam the whole entire ride.
ALL THESE DOPE AS FUCK ARTISTS, THE HOTTEST BEAT AND ALL THEY CAN SAY IS "ITS A VIBE"..... POORLY WRITTEN AND PUT TOGETHER SUCH A WAISTE OF A "POSSIBLY" GREAT SONG....
How you get more fire at the END of your rapping career 🔥🔥
Nobody fall for that Don Thrilla bs hes trash using fake accounts to spread his name
Whoever can name the guy at 0:28 is a real G
every time I'm trying to increase the frequency of my vibe I come hear
vibe way too lit i dont even have to spit https://soundcloud.com/kerson-lyricalgee/semihotz-ft-gifted-boujee-face
trey songz beard on life support
sampled off bitch dont kill my vibe????
She want to vibe 
Why is murdas tag not in the song anymore
wow i just come to realise that i keep listning this song since Avr...funn!!!
Headed to iTunes...
Weakest lyrics and features apart from 2 chainz..
Murda Beatz with the cameo
This video is perfect, it's exactly how I pictured the song in my head.
shit beyound fire its inferno yo
Would be even better if 2 Chainz wasn't in it
It's a knife...
2 Chains This The Rawest One Yet King Run That Shut Up #SALUTE from The Boot
take out trey songs and jhene they ruined this song
am i the only one who see Andre 3000 in 0:03
gas in a zip lock now it's loud in clear 🔥
YEAHHH YEEEEAAAHHH!
Some remixes are own they way
does anyone knows where can i find the sunglasses of Dolla Sign..plz guys
trey has the best part 👌
bitch don't kill my vibe ????????
look at jhene aiko..Just sitting there..LOOKING DELICIOUS AF
Trey songz look like he about to ask that girl for spare change.... Pubic sideburn looking ass
Can't stop listening to this song in my mind, wtf 2 Chainz you doing with my brain :D?
Atlanta boyz  at the top of the game other states need to level up
2 Chainz goes in
MFS sleep on tit
Chainz is one of the few 1990-2010 rappers to be able to adapt to the "modern" rap and damn he did it well
I think the instrumental carries the song more than the lyrics , which kinda makes it a vibe .
Don thrilla is the goat
The beat smooth af
this shit fire !!!! check me out https://soundcloud.com/quida-bee #femaleartist #waitingonthecomeup
wow they not even render beats over 128 kBit/s anymore... sounds clashing and shit... WTF
finally a music video where even females take control. bless 2 chainz
COOL SONG 2 Chainz
Is it just me or did jhene get so ugly??
Ok I get it. It's a vibe. What else?
Trey mad as hell he couldn't take his shirt off
I think it's a vibe? I could be wrong.
jhene aiko be rapping not singing to me
Who else thinks that Chris Brown is the main piece missing here?.
This song ENDS faster than it PLAYS is it a vibe? BTW +JheneAiko I FCKN LUV YU!!!
2chainz on it
This shit b ridin
jhene Aiko"s bought me her part lit y & Chainz snapped on this banger
I like Trey Songz but why does he look like a we're wolf 🐺 lol I don't mean no hate.
NEW VIBE NEW BANGER! LISTEN NOW!! https://soundcloud.com/alce-f/let-it-stack
Jhene's voice gives me goosebumps
Lyrically, they've could've done more with this song.
Jhene Aiko always sounds like shes falling asleep when she sings
the migos woulda bust these speakers
Said it's a vibe, that's a vibe more than anything else said in the song
Damn man, I see that money... I'll dance for anyone if i get shit like that.
I wish this was 10 mins long with even more features
"gas in a ziplock now that's loud and clear" 2 chainz killed that verse!
Tity Boi is back.
trey songz killed this song🔥🔥🔥
2 chains is a fuckin pimp
I think they're saying it's a vibe
Issa vibe fam
I'm a fan of this man. And I DON'T listen to today's music. 2chainz and Ken. Lamar
man I woke up in another house.. where the fuck am I?
So my girlfriend just pointed out how trey songs looks like Robert Downey Jr from tropic thunder lol
Jhene Aiko will forever be my bitch! She never disappoints. This whole song is just dope ♥️
This is horrible how other humans can treat other humans like this. This world is very sick.
fake news. if he was on the news to trust anyone with the story he would be somewhere he woukdnt have to hide his identity. obviously not looking for authoritive help, just looking to change minds it seems to me
WHAT did he expect...?......a parade....?
Very fake news.
are my earbuds broken or is it the video
Staged  news again
I love to take photos and this video tell me all I have to know. I want a new phone, now I took a decision. You re amazing! thanks for your job! I want a LG G6, hate galaxy 😜😅
crazy, tons of info test, awesome job!
LG G6 Is the best and the audio is awesome
Where is p10 plus
pixel.. low light.. killd it.. .// but  the S8 its crysp too.. LG g6, i'm dissapointed... but for the price tho'... its ok
I can't focus on the phones.. There is a lot of distraction, LOL
Google pixel is just far better for videos
I really like your enthusiasm. It's a joy watching your videos.
i think the LG G6 is better
That Pixel camera is amazing. Suck it iPhones.
i'll go with the LG G6
amazing review as always Krystal, I like the places you have chosen for this video!!, and I love how how detailed are your comparisons.
For me in term of  Rear camera Pixel > S8 > G6 Selfie Pixel = S8 > G6 Video S8 > Pixel > G6 Wide Photo G6 only since it got the wide angle lense...
S8 or Pixel, G6 don't like at all (blurry in dark, somewhat zooms all pictures and artificially saturated colours. Anyway, the best photo phone of today is Huawei P10 - best details and sharpness.
You are cute
Pixel is king of cameras. This coming from a IOS user
NOTE 8 will kill every phone in 2017
you making high quality videos.. I'M A FAN NOW..
for me pixel is the winner :)
i think this is a good comparison and I like your video
In that first video sample the G6's camera has crazy saturated colours
nice video ... still prefer camera from S8 :)
Pixel is so god damn insane dayum
Hey Krystal! Amazing video! Love the way you do you reviews (how you expose the specifications of the phone and the way you cover everything in these comparations)
I prefer to go with the galaxy s8 due to its good image processing and delivering it properly
pls pick me for s8 plus i really want a s8 plus i cant afford a s8 plus and i only own a fake s7 edge pls pls pick me i never win pls pick me
Samsung is the winner..... The s8 is not only a smartphone... it's a beast also
Don't say warmer, say it true tone color which actually makes sense then the S8 & G6 artificial color pictures. Pixel is clear winner with every shots just perfect. see how much saturated colors & pictures are in Pixel.
Punchy as usual plus your voice does it for me🤣
I got my G6 from T-mobile yesterday.  So far I'm content,  especially with the camera. That wide angle camera is a must have now. Thanks again for your reviews. 😎
Cameras are getting better and better... This is really helpful for decision making. Congratulations for your videos! Your enthusiasm really make them stand out. Keep up the good work!
G6 colours are horrific and it's low light is truly awful.
always love your perspective on phone camera's
Man only can make good video than women
u r so preety😋
Love the channel! I personally have the Pixel and love it, but I do like the duel camera feature with the LG G6!
Great variety of shots covered in this video! Very comprehensive, well done!
idk why I come here.... knowing damn well I can't afford none of these phones
You're really bright, and sexier when you talk about smartphones...... Kristal cute smile... perfect! Saludos desde Ecuador
which is the best dslr camera for photography  pls tell me
I am the new subscriber
u r the too cutest than flagshipzzz 😍
Krystal, I love how your videos have improved and how you are able to inject your personality in all of them. I can't wait for the next one. Keep up the great work.
can u do Huawei mate 9 and Huawei p10
You're awesome at cameras.
Can you compare the Camera performance of LG G6 and Huawei P10? thank you.
She looks butterfly
Pixel - for dynamic range.
peer to peer ·The Galaxy S8 ( Better Colors ) ·The Pixel ( More Realistic ) And then the LG G6 isn't that great but pros to the wide angle shots.
LG G6 the best! ;P
damn, the pixel is the king of andro
ByTheWay - A saturated video in LG G6 can be fixed by MANUAL VIDEO MODE which can easy change color and etc.
LG G6 is best camera phone :) Just use manual settings to fix ISO and Exposure and quality will be better about 50% than auto. LG G6 (y)
wow so professional
SHUT UP, HOW DO I CHANGE MY BACKGROUND OR WALLPAPER ON MY S8+
your reviews are awesome and i appreciate it
1:30 Very Beautiful <3
I am fucking you Krystal meet me
give me your number please, I'm in love with you
Not sure if this was covered yet, but were these pictures taken on full auto? Or were the options all set the same ? Exposure and white balance, etc.
iphone 6s would destroy any of this 3. destroy!
Love the wide angle on the G6 and the regular camera looks just as good as other two in good light so... G6 for me :) (I got way better cameras for low light anyway)
lg has lost the charm already
Thank you for this comparison. I'll go with the LG G6. In my opinion, it captures better photos and is cheaper than the S8. Thanks again and keep up the good work.
Pixel is still winning.  S8 comes close though.  Excellent choice of cameras to compare.  One of the best presentations as well.
Another great video, your editing and visual effects keep getting better. Thanks for the comparison.
you can't tell the difference that much
Pixel all the way
Krystal... I know you get this asked alot but can you do s8 give away
Awesome comparison.  Really liked the moving animations/labels in the beginning. How did you do that?
this is how camera comparison should be done. you're simply awesome. great review 😍.
Since I'm brown the neighbors think I'm studying #grinding 😂😂
YO HOLY SHIT
land of the free? fuck outta here
respect from Turkey !
Why does it say 23:00 but it's day time
how america rap music has fallen LOL
dear white people...
*why is it so light outside at 11pm*
This is the most North Carolina style song i've heard since Raise up by Petey Pablo
So fucked up!!
Fucking bad
How tf you live next to j Cole and not know it's him
What the fuck is this anyway 🙂!
Was anyone else expecting the house to go "BOOM!"?
his neighbor thought oh shit... why there are 10 F.B.I cops :D
The dislikes come from the racist white fucks
I couldn't remain as humble as J.Cole if this happened to me he's the fucking 🐐
Oooops, too late, it's on the cloud now.  Taking the cameras down didn't help your cause, idiot cops.
#fuck neibourghs
they moved the cameras wtf??
Dope music.
Love how the kick lines up with the door busting open
Oh maybe he's in here  * breaks down the door* Oh shit that was stupid,hope no one sees that * Removes the the camera*
Even if you bake all your neighbors a pie to say hi. They'll always question how you got the money 4 the ingredients.
OMG JCOLE KING <3
0:25 The officer in the middle starts humping the guy in front of him xD
Fuck the pigs
Welcome to America!
Ha Ha, foolish Negros.Of course white people make you act like fools?
knock knock mother fucker
Wow 10/10 great song
Those neighbors are cunts
"Black man can't get rich. Expensive house, must be dealing drugs. Call the cops Hun"
If they have nothing to hide they wouldn't need to remove the cameras.
They didnt investigate. if all it takes for police to kick ur door down is a rumor we all have a problem
Cole's neighbors probably heard Cole and his team bragging that the album is gonna be dope and panicked.
sorry why is america supposedly the best nation in the world again??? hahahah delusional much
"We don't like yer kind 'round 'ere!"
IF You want anigga u go have to send a SWAT team
The UK artists are runnin tingz at the min.. But big up J Cole, holding up America with REAL HIP HOP for the world to notice
Nothing but love
Okay the dope thinks I'm selling neighbours
look at all those turds
i like the music ...love you..
this is trash as fuck.
Drake sent in the swat team to steal lyrics from j cole
Why did he reload
smart short video, just to get his point across.
WTF???  Is this a prank ? Did J Cole got swatted?
That was on my birthday •_•
lmao, nigga tore down the door just to look cool
I shit you not 20 min ago neighbours call cops on me and all I did was listening music on my headphone? how is that a noise compliant?
This is a problem of a black man living in a white community.
Please don't put the blame on the SWAT team, put the blame on the racist neighbors.
y move the camera tho 🤔🤔🤔
They destroyed the camera so they wouldn't give their position away not to hide the evidence. The only way they could hide the evidence is if they put up a new door real quick
Racist ass neighbors, they see a black man living and they assume he sells narcotics...
It looks like he has no neighbors
What happened in this video
fucking with this new shit 🔥
I need a firetruck at my house right now
Wait I'm so confused did this actually happen to cole in real life
Um hell yeahh
checking to see if he had any good songs
out of all the rappers that smoke weed and all that and they call the swat team on Cole 🤦🏻‍♀️
fuck the police
Is the neighbor who called the police going to be charge with a heavy bill for making a false call?
Finally early
Wow ,crazy thing about it he wasn't even home and they ain't find anything.  lol he's selling some dope ass music
Dude it pisses me off that they broke the cameras thinking literally this - "shit we found absolutely nothing incriminating whatsoever but we were filmed breaking in.... we look like idiots, break the cameras quick"
Over some damn weed, sit your ass down and try some before your ass start judging.
White people...
They all coulda been killed over some weed when the white people who called the police probably have kids doing molly and pills. White people are awful.
J-HOPE FROM BTS WANTS TO COLLABORATE WITH YOU!
Question from the UK, why is US police so heavy handed?
Imagining a 90 year old man as his neighbour and he like 'RICH BLACK PEOPLE ?, get the military the worlds ending'. White people - Don't blame us
fake fake fake fake.its all for hype..
All the feds that broke in gave the dislikes kmt
ytf are they destroying property for no reason,
This is what happens if you give consent kids...
He must be selling dope tho
Why would Cole have a wooden panel on his back door. I call bull shit to this being his house.
getting something from nothing should pay taxes ,were I get taxed on my labor is bull shit I work for the $ not the government .
The process for non prof is not easy.  No taxes for religious and other HELPFUL proposals is the correct way.  The IRS gets THEIR money either way .
Snoop Dogg ,that would be awesome !!!
MORE BASKETBALL PLAYERS PLEASE!!!!
Woo! More hoop stars. Love the variety you get in!
Get Michael Jordan now 😈
No comment on cold wings this time? Are they finally working on that? Or did you run down to the corner store right before this was shooting to grab the wings this time?
I'm pretty sure Kevin Love and Scott Eastwood are long lost brothers.
I haven't gotten notifications for the past 3 videos anyone else had this problem?
this wouldn't faze curry (:
"most difficult player to defend not dirk nowitzki?"  always love it when my idol gets a shout out #teamswish41
Commenters... I need help. What's a "medium hot" hot sauce (maybe habanero level) that is pretty spicy but tastes really good? I want to get a present for someone.
ok maybe try n get jim jeffries and i still say you should get atmosphere
"next one is da bomb...... DA bomb"
lol he straighten the bottles that's something I would do.
I love this show. Once a week I go on my 30 minute break I eat lunch and watch this show. Gets me through my shift honestly
I still want to know what his favorite beach boys deep cut is...
Hope this want cast during the playoffs, Kevin gonna have the shits mid-game
May I suggest Gordon Ramsey?
okay has anyone else noticed the host moves his hands to damn much, and when he does it's not synchronized. lmao
until the last wing
Next week. Chris Rock.
I ordered the Hot One's hot sauce. It's so delicious and has a nice kick. Dumped half a bottle on my wings before it hit me
Bill Murray?
it never shows the other guy eating the wings......... i bet he didnt eat any.
yasss i learned so much
i love WB but what the fuck? u want it to be 75. that shit molests me in sweat. 68 is perf i even prefer lower.
When was this shot it couldn't have been during the season right?
Eminem as guest would be a dope ass interview and hilarious as well
for some crazy reason the rock is still not the show ?!
I put money RJ twerks to Back that Azz Up.  Guaranteed
Sean must be a Raptors fan if he's gonna be fucking up Kevins stomach right before game 3
Sean you looked so sleepy in the beginning lmao
Breaking news: Kevin Love misses the playoff due to a hole in his intestines.
WE NEED I DUBBBZ!!!
GO RAPTORS FUCK THE CAVS... raptors are gonna lose aren't they....
a basketball player? sigh lame
You gotta get Connor McGregor on this
Bring more NBA Players on !!!
Yo, what the FUCK SEAN!?!?! where's the, "No big deal"?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Eminem on Hot Ones needs to happen
Get pk subban. Best person ever
Holy shit.  I already love this series but interviewing Kevin love!  The only way this gets better is if he gets lebron to come on
NBA edition would be a nice series. Bring Curry, Dwight, LeBron, Kobe and more.
Cavs gonna lose cuz of this right here!

The people have spoke....We want Obama!

More ghost peppers!
Absolutely love the reach this show has. Keep it up was the amazing guests!
Get me on the show, I will eat 11 out of the 10 wings
Who is rubbing their hands at 16:55?
Get Idubbbz on here please!!!
get a UFC fighter!
you gotta have Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye next on the show. That would be funny af
Kevin Love did this during halftime of last night's game against the Raptors.
Kyrie Irving
Schoolboy Q would be perfect for this show
I thought it was going to say kristaps porzingis
You should have warned him about touching his face. You warned other guests, but not him for some reason.
Chris rock is coming guys!!! Yes!!!!
Next time Kevin Love is in your town, go to all the hotels and ask for "Bill Carson" thats the man they were searching for in The Good The Bad, And the Ugly
my boy sean got a SPONSOR?
These past guests have been 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
gordon ramsay, bill burr, louis ck, dave chappelle. GET IT DONE BOI

Number 2 should be renamed Laptops because I can buy a rig and buy new parts for it. But, doing the same for a laptop you may as well buy a new one.
the last 2 only counts for Apple products. I have a 3 year old Samsung and it's stil very fast and my old pc was 5 years old but I got  a new one because now I game more on them
I have windows 10 on a 16 year old PC and it runs pretty damn good, all I have done was up the ram and put in a SSD.  Glad I don't use apple.
#1 IPhone 5 chargers....
i dont even own a printer anymore
Gonna be awesome, pretty great seeing stock footage from a Kansas City news station on that textbook one.
funny how my oven and fridge are over 20 and my truck is a 1977 Suburban, still running stong
Wow! Thx for reminding me! Snapped me out of that consumer b.s. that I don't need the newest things. I can wait 5 yrs. or so before buying the new Samsung 12!
I read the title as "Top 10 Apple products that are designed to fail"😳
damn new cars, so much tec they barely last 10 years
just join the pc master race
theres a difrence between not lasting forever and being disened to fail
you lyers they make new consoles because you cant play super mario oddessy on the snes
iPhones are the worst.
but wait there's more!! like humans this concept will evolve and be so much worse
why are people so obsessed with phones....
my super nes is still working
Anyone else noticed that creepy girl on 2:05

The Motorola MC40 is proof that a smartphone can be designed to withstand being dropped from the top of a ladder onto a concrete floor, and survive with just a small dent in the shell.

What a bunch of dicks.
PC MASTER RACE
Wow! Some of the people who run these companies that make these products should be prosecuted for criminal behavior. Although that is unlikely.
Solution to #2: build your own goddamn desktop instead of buying a new computer.
just buy a pc more need for consoles and games from all gen. are able to be played
OMG that iPhone gag was gold
Peter wins with the bookshelf choice
If you car was built like a Nokia phone, one I bought in 2003 still works but the 2G network was shut down, You would never need a new one.
this is my favorite speedycube64 video
Products have been made to fail sooner, all the way down to the solder connections in PC boards. You can thank the EU for that one
#0 every apple products.
NO Backwards compatibility is f*ck
all apple products.
anything made by Apple will fail and the sheep will keep buying them
Consoles,Meh
my old phone is at Least 8 years old (it's a huwi acend that ran Android 4.0) and it ran fine (after four dunks in the sink) but now I'm using a Moto
why is this legal?
A better example for video games would be removing server support for a game effectively making it worthless.
HP sends out "an update" that causes the printers to crash requiring customers to either have them 'repaired' or replaced.
I have a first gen moto g running android n.
humans should have been on this list.
Proof of old cars being well built - My dad has an old Nissan Micra. When he bought it (second hand, about 5 years ago), it had a cassette player. The car still works, and very well might I add.
Why the he'll isn't this illegal? This is bullshit.
FUCK Capitalism.
i don't know what you're talking about I've had my flatscreen for years and it still runs amazing.
my response to #9: PCMASTERRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
Ha!!! still have my n64
4:00 I see my college! hell yea! Go NKU!
Make products that dies out faster to sell more a scummy move that is genius
I agree with pantyhoses being on the list, as someone who has to wear pantyhose as part of my choir outfit.
shut up and take my money
I was expecting a Simpson's reference at the pantyhose part
It sickens me how shady big business is. It's like all the gypsies just perfected their scams to where they're literally running the world now.
The greatest rip off I ever encountered was food... I keep buying that stuff but after a single use it's useless. Well it's useless if you are not into that shit, I AM LOOKING AT YOU DONALD!
PC components and laptops die so often cuz morons use them
i dont have smartphone
That thumbnail pisses me off.   Seriously, that fucking thumbnail is driving me insane. Change it right now.
13 years for a fridge is bad ? fridge is literally 200 euros
My phone was fine. Siemens s45i, used from 2004 till 2015. Had all the features i needed, phoning and text.
Pc gaming master race
A lot of the items listed I have had for a long time. The last thing I had to replace, my laptop, was at least 10 years old and still ran well until the hard drive took a dump.
and that why i only play fhsw never obsolete
4:35 - That lightbulb has been on since 1901? Seriously? amazing.
computers from 5 to 6 years ago are still good, with windows 10
I keep cars for at least 10 years
pc does not have the same problems as consoles, backwards compatibility is there, cross compatilitblity, and emulators
Planned obsolescence should be illegal. If a company cant be arsed to continue support on a product such as iPhone 3GS, then they should be forced to make it open source.

Cell Phones suck! Addictive pieces of trash!
8:04 I literally saw someone doing this the other day. Someone beating on an electronic device like a retarded ape trying to get it to work. It wasn't funny.
my new hero
This video is proving every point that he made. Now I'm thinking, "Wow. He was right."
The background music is too much
Really I just watched his real stand up and he isn't awful, I did catch myself laughing but this stuff was really weak material. For any material this was weak material
Of course they only show the worst parts of his monologue. They cut out the anti-MSM savagery as well.. sad.
Hasan THE BEST
Not an immigrant or a practicing Muslim, completely fake, plus he the worst comedian to ever grace this event
This guy is a hack
NBC chose like the worst clips from this dinner...
Who even listens to the MSM or Comedy Central any more. This dude is not funny; just the same old tired jokes. Try going to your "motherland" in the middle east and talking like that.  Ungrateful little twit.
You're racist if you point out the objective fact that this guy is actually not funny.
Pff. Aristocrats.
dude is not EVEN funny.
First comment
I've never understood why people put a ring in their nose.
Today my grandmother asked me why I haven't given her great grandchildren, making me feel a bit guilty. This seems to be working to reinforce my position.

Disgraceful how many people refuse to just do their trash the right way. I don't like some of the laws on how NYC handles trash but if it really bothers you, move.
Soy sauce looks dangerous. We must deal with it
A Japanese/English accent crossover sounds neat
Soy sauce is not JAPANESE! This video is talking about the beginning of JAPANESE SOY SAUCE, not what we know as soy sauce collectively. How misleading!
Can't wait to watch the next video titled the national pride of kanji.
There's always some little town in Japan. it's either they do something good or something completely fucked up.
I knew that Soy Sauce made popular today started in Japan but I never thought of where in Japan. Thanks for the short documentary. :D
this is so kul
Yuasa Town flava
Now we know the secret
Soy Sauce originally from China 2000 year ago, not from Japan!o (╯□╰)o
mmm this makes me wanna go drink a packet of soy sauce in my fridge right now. Love the sauce!!
Should be more through with the narrative.
Apparently everybody is a historian
people...the original chinese jiang wasn't soy based, it was meat and fish based. Tamari SOY sauce then it was invented from the soy jiang made in China. Chinese people didn't use that liquid for seasoning at all.
Need to try some of that original Soy Sauce.  The crap they sell at Walmart is nothing but dyes and MSG.
Sooo...... what is the name of the company featured in the video?  You're just gonna gloss over that?
I've got an essay due and an exam tomorrow, yet here I am watching how soy sauce is made.
Okay but, what about the junk in grocery stores?
pretty awesome.
great video, lovely scenes but wasnt soy sauce invented in China? in the 5th century?
I hate to say it, but I consume so much shoyu that it's practically a food group.
So many butthurt Sinophiles in the comments
this is no secret I sweat this stuff out all day.
Islam will conquer japan and we will get rid of these kuffār ways :-)
La Choy is the best soy sauce.
What camera was used to shoot this doc?
God imagine making the building block for most Chinese cuisine
I put that shit on everything!
how big is a bottle of sauce made this way and how much does it cost?
it's crazy how all soy sauce comes from there
"It's heated over a fire of red pine logs"  *THE HEAT SOURCE DOESN'T MATTER*  "Has to be mixed regularly by hand"  *MY ASS*
BUT WHERE IS THE LAMB, SAUCEEEEEE
Soy sauce makes men...gay.  Its high in estrogen vitamins.
I dont like Japanese soy sauce, too thin. I prefer more tasty Chinese soy sauce.
i heard its made of human hair
Beautiful cinematography! I need to know the equipment and camera settings!!
Now, I must buy a bottle from this plant.
0:28 Wtf that can't be right. That's fucked up that Nat Geo straight up discredited the Chinese there, I thought these guys should show/teach history and not make up.
I think it could use a little more blue and orange.
It be unfortunate to have a soya allergy​ living there
Real world example of unethical documentary.
Nice video, but soy sauce originated from China, not from a small town in Japan.
handasons relish is better made in yorkshire UK Sheffield
anybody know what brand of soy sauce this is?
basically old Asian sweat
3:37 *THE MONEY SHOT*
But what if you fall in at 2:50
I wonder what that building smells like.  I bet it smells quite good.  Call me crazy but I could watch soy sauce being squished out by that press all day long.
Soy Sauce came from China, like most other things "from" Japan.  Read a book sometime people...
Reddit brought me here
the "how it's made" version is more informative.
Brilliant Video. Where can i buy exactly that soy sauce?  Please let me know.
I like this guy's voice. A hint of what I assume is Japanese but also large accents of English in there. Gives an interesting thought into the mixture of two cultures
The cinematography was just as interesting as the contents. It made a 5 minute video feel like 1 minute.
OMG. the compressed audio is ruining this for me.
Dam thats crazy i take my teriyaki for granted
4:06 "the results of soy sauce is then bottled and shit
Woaw so that's the secret. It was made by cops all this time!
Japan didn't invent soy sauce nor did they have rice first. Neither did they have noodles first or invent chopsticks, all of which are from China.  95% of their culture is from China.
whaaaaaaaat? soy sauce invented in Japan? R U FREAKING SERIOUS? I think even most of japanese wont say that!
C'mon Japan, stop copying ancient Chinese culture and use your own for once. Oh wait...
thank you my yellow Asian niggas for blessing the wolrd with the magnificent black sauce know as soy saucearu
soya suace making feels like a great piece of art ... thanks for the video and awesome cinematography ...
Beautifully made, NatGeo at it's finest
Japan! China! Soy sauce! Jib Jib Jib facts and stuff!!
Al Gore invented Soy Sauce in the 1990s.
Ya show how Kikkomen makes it instead lol
And you 中 retards are wrong, what was originated in China was called 'jan', this video is about tamari soy sauce. Do some basic research and respond back to me...
Origins, who cares. Who makes the better quality Soy Sauce...
National Geographic failed to fact check. Soy sauce originated in China sometime between the 3rd and 5th century.
You should make a film on Soy Sauce origin in China. Japanese had no soy sauce in their meal before 13th century. Hmm..their sushi must be quite bland then.
1:15 "He had learned to the kind of Miso.." what? what does that even mean?
Whats the name or brand of the sauce in the video were this is made.
This is why you shouldnt trust the internet
18 months and 3.5 years whaaat
Mmm  soy sauce  MSG  smothering onions  garlic  touch of black pepper w/any kinda meat  sometimes organic apple cider vinegar  over steamed rice  go a long way
750 year old recipe for toxic pisswater.
This is quite possibly the best video I've ever seen on YouTube. Where do I buy this at?
So how do I get some that real soy sauce?
What the fuck? Soy source was invented in China! You western fools! Actually, everything Japanese is originally from China!
Misleading title
china also invented eating dogs, cats and rats. doesn't mean it's better cause they made it first. ever notice there are no stray cats or dogs in Chinatown?
i want that mulan szechuan sauce now!!
this video is way too dark.
The real birthplace of Soya sauce is in China…
Looks like a bleached butthole, but they just bleached the dead center.  And they call these gloryholes. Wonder why...
WOW, so THAT is what a gay man's penis sees...
cool.where does that go to?
Very nice job! If I wasn't 3000 miles away I'd definitely be there with my Phantom 3!
Trippy, cool video shots
Good thing the spillway doesn't feed the powerplant at the base of the dam.
2:40 Looks like the opening to some Dr. Who episodes.
I don't think you know what glory hole means...,.

Bro within few hrs thousands of views please provide some tips if Possible
Hey guys! I just couldn't not do a Star Wars video. Hope you enjoy! What films should I do in a future video? Comment below to let me know your thoughts!
Ending was lame as shit! Bad guy aims gun at protagonist, spouts some evil dialogue and gets shot in the back. How is that a good ending? It is sooo forgetable and mediocre.
OMG! You are a thousand times cooler because of this video. Thanks for the awesome analysis and the Starwars books suggestions.
8 trips?! I saw TFA 2x, but only because I told two different friends I'd see it with them individually for the first time.   Great video!
Heyyy.   I hope you can make a video about Inception and Interstellar. Huhu pleaseee
Rogue one > Episode VII
this is stupid blog mongo script analisis. My god cinema art is really dead.
Rouge One makes A New Hope better. Force Awakens makes Return of the Jedi worse.
rogue one was really a terrible film, the fault lies in the writing. worse lines i have ever heard from many films.
That's what you look like!? Black nostalgia critic??
they both sucked ass so doesn't matter
A sublime summation.
Rogue One is still the more entertaining of the two films. Hell, its the most entertaining out of the entire series.
Finn still deserved to be the Jedi, not bland ass Rey
TFA good start, bad middle/end. R1 good end, bad start/middle. For the beginning of a new trilogy, I'd be happier if those characteristics were reversed :-/
The coolest YouTube badge show off ever.
THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR!!!!!! BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT EVER!!!
ok. Here is the problem with 5:46. please god sir go put your self in that situation and if you can even speak i'll give you 1 pound
That's why games are better and books. lol show don't tell. I ask you look at the scene in a book the problem is you can't connect mind with reality in realtime like games can. I,e movies are outdated
Been honest, i liked Rogue One more, and didn`t like sword fights in chapter Vll (wich is just like chapter lV) yes we all know it , they use the  lightsabers like they were metal swords lol.
A 13 minute video explaining agency without ever using the word agency.
Rogue one is better than TFS
Meh. Both movies sucked. And none of the characters were interesting.
I love your videos, they are objective and critical, you don't hate for the sake of hating or love because Star wars, you are able to Enjoy the films and see their faultts and make suggestion on how they could be better
Hey, you. Save yourself from the comments section. Don't scroll any further. It's too late for me, but it's not for you. Go! Resist the dark side. And tell my children i love them!
Greetings from Argentina, great work! And congrats for the Audible.com support!
This channel is amazing. Have you thoughts about doing Fargo (the Coen brothers' movie) next? Would love to see you dissect their screenwriting, and it's one of their best examples.
Do a video on death note
Great video. I have had a lot of these same thoughts and feelings about TFA and RO, but you put it so eloquently and simply!
Your background music is distracting. Incredible channel otherwise :D
That little ending was fantastic! Catching the picture haha
I was wondering if you're thinking about doing a video on 'Memento'?
when he showed the first quote from a book that tell how you should do shit we can realize he will never make a movie that really touches people, only by the book history. Can someone show slackers to this guy? 
Well done again! I've just bought the book "STORY" because you use it so much in your reviews!!!
10:44 you mean, like A New Hope?
Ray is a completely uncompelling character
So... um Which one was better?... (i haven't seen it all and if it says that TFA is better then i'd rather not see it.)
It would be interest if you make a video about Sex, Lies, and Videotape. That movie shines mostly by its screenplay
I'd love to see The Wolf of Wall Street
9:29 false, the trip resulted in Cassian believing that the intentions of Galen Erso were good. Because of that Cassian joined Jyn in stealing the Death Star plans
Rogue One was an original story, The Force Awakens was a shitty reboot of A New Hoe (oops, I meant A New Hope)
very well done!
I could tell that you really enjoyed making this video, which made me enjoy it even more! Keep up the good work!
This video is perfection
steve jobs by Aron Sorkins
This is what happens when someone goes to university and thinks everything taught there is the Truth.
I really agree with them going to see Jyn's father. By father the most boring part of the movie, I actually fell asleep.
Since you like star wars so much, would you mind doing a critic over the Hero's Journey? I mean, besides comparing it to Eragon.
Please do Split!!!
gooood   goOooood
What films do you think are perfect (or nearly)??
Why is no one ackowledging your amazing Jedi skills? That was the most adorable outro ever
Are you able to review the work of Jane Champion- The Piano and Bright star. Her recent work the mini-series Top of the lake is excellent, and it would interesting to see what you think.
This is anecdotal but Finn was such an unmemorable character i struggle to remember even his name the other day, the only significant thing he did i can remember was be a traitor to the first order
This is so good. Subbed
This sums up pretty well why Rogue One is a terrible movie. You can't have a good movie without good characters. TFA was a much better
Hey vsauce  Michael here
Great video
I agree with most of this video, but the scene where the pilot gets mind-tourtured is to show that saw gerrera is so far gone that he can't get passed his paranoia.
Dude, thank you! I'm a Star Wars fan and I really liked Rogue One, but I felt that there was something wrong about the movie, and now I know what it was!
meh....not as funny as Baldwin.
throwing a donnunt... talking about NK
Bringing stale bore back is as ridiculous as clinging to Jon Stewart. No one with any portion of a brain enjoys short's comedy.
J for Genius 😂😂😂
OMFG LOVE THIS   MARTIN SHORT IS SO FUNNY
Best one yet!
how awesome I was just thinking about great Jiminy Glick was and then he shows up on FALLON!
"Sometimes when I'm choking on food, I find more food helps" 😅😅😅
"You've met Vladimir Putin. What does he taste like?"  I died!   JW3HH
Martin short owes us a million dollars for betting against him.
Martin Short sucks he's not funny never was never will be
I was hoping Glick would fall out of his chair or over on the coffee table. The Donuts were not as funny as the M n M's or skittles that he spills all over the floor. But Still funny to see Jiminy Glick again.
Now I have to get rid of my Damn Cat. Dammit Man.
Leftist comedy is dead
I know this is asking too much from the comedy gods,,,but any way to get Glick to interview Spicer (Mccarthy)?
hhaahaa😂😂 martin short great!
Has Martin become that fat or is it just makeup?
"Say China.""Gyna"LMAO!!!!!!!!!
just give me Martin Short all day long, can't get enough, he's magic ;)
Can any liberal Democrat ever have any respect for the office of the President? The 44th president was actually not born in the US, and spent 8 years scamming the people of the US!
I don't like Trump but must say that the sense of humour here is so bitchy and low-level. It's like projecting your own complexes and thinking that people are laughing cos you're funny.
After watching Fallon's now in-famous interview of Trump (tussling his hair); I am not enjoying any of his clips.
Thin investigation only nowhere rather proud uniform.
"What does the J stand for?" "Genius."  I'm dead.
These two.... and Martin Short is still great. 😎 #notificationsoff
Marty Short is the best
Look around ...see how few whites are on TV ...look at all the mix race couple propaganda.... look at all the spying on us yet anybody can enter America
That was priceless! You guys must do another!
Did Donald run for President to keep Melania from divorcing him???
Made my whole day!
Love you Martin Short!  You had me laughing for days with this skit.  Heck I'm still laughing!  Bravo!
These videos are just retarded
This basically is not funny. Hack.
Goddammit I saw the title and thought it would be the real Trump.
I hate Trump but why didn't these elitists have this kinda fun with Barry "Ima sign this and walk away" Obama?
Love me some Jiminy Glick!
i kind of wish an actual reporter would ask half as many tough questions like jiminy glick
when he hits him with those papers....
That was so not funny
jiminy isnt funny but jimmy is
Funny they didn't do something similar to mock Obama for his failed promises! Liberal propaganda at the best.
I'm not an idiot Trump supporter but while watching this video, I realized the Trump jokes are starting to get old. Small hands is the opener? ...snoring
Please attempt to be funny. Lame. So much material missed.
lib retards  not funny  even the laff track is fake not funny crap
Seeing how Jimmy corpse's all the time, I bet this took over 100 takes.
The writing is the best I've seen on this show and Short/Glick stole the show.
Jesus Christ this video is ADD
crossed the line to mean mean mean
regardless of how funny it is , one skit like this about obama and the show would be removed .
Hahaha this killed me.
not even funny
I want Zack Galiafanakis to do a Between Two Ferns with Trump lol
No matter how many times I watch this I can't stop laughing hilarious
That "What did he taste like?" at 2:50 made me laugh the hardest
Now I'm just wondering but if they made this about Obama, would they be called nazis?
Please find a way to do this everyday! Trust me we need it
Martin Short is the shiznit
Terribly directed, otherwise fun performances and great entertainers of our time.
The hands of the president are too big...
can you do a sketch on Slithery Clinton please?
I expected funny. What happened  ?
i thought jiminy was higgins in a mask from the thumbnail😂😂😂
That was 5 wasted minutes of my life that I can never get back. Watching fish sticks cook is more entertaining than that skit.
We NEED more Jiminy Glick man!!!
2k+ snowflake conservatives with their thumbsdown
that was amazing.
When he shoves all the donuts into his mouth is the best
Not every one can pull off making their mouth look like a cats butt hole as it walks away like you do. LOL
omg I love Jiminy Glickkk
How is this funny ?
THAT WAS HYSTERICAL
Too funny!  Brilliant!
I ain't gonna lie, that was brutal. I died the whole time.
Very weak. Cant the tonight show come up with something else then mocking trump.. .????
This is the content I signed up for. Not the fat acceptance movement.
Human robot
I Wonder If He Has Footage Of The Ocean ! Things We've Never Seen Before !
Easy way is to cover cameras in a highly reflective coat. Animals get so confused.
underrated channel
If I saw a robot human I would freak!
WOW! How awesome is that!
I'm going to need my tinfoil hat for this one.
why does this remind me of The Incredibles?
And that's how Aliens spy on us but with Crazier Technology !
RIP turtle cam.
thers probly robot humans in the worlds observing other humans
a spy is sapping my sentry
There was a TV show in the U.K. A couple months ago which used these spy creatures.
that's some awesome equipment... thanks for sharing.
Thats kinda fucked if you think of it. Just imagen one day going home from school or job and all of a sudden a robotic looking man or women with a camra in its eye approach you?
this is the samething aliens are doing to us right now! lol
the monkey was fucking terrifying
0:39 DAB!!!
They are so realistic looking! Amazing!
where can we watch the footage
If those robots take actions more realistically it will help us understand animals more and maybe even learn to communicate with them
I love this! Saw on other tv shows such cameras used and it's nice knowing where they come from!
The thumbnail is froggen creepy
very cool :))
Thats creepy
I want one!!  I also want to see some more footage featuring these adorable creations.
This was so DOPE... yet cute!!
i want a spy duck
That poor tortoise he got mated with by another tortoise, kidnapped by a monkey and stepped on by an elephant
Is this how aliens spy on us? Think about that. Or, maybe the Government. It's scary. What do you guys think?
and some countries has developed it for their military for years.
I think the animals are just freaked out
america will use this to spy on its ppl
This is awesome. I love seeing filmmaking technology evolving in this way.
I hate Great Big Story because it isn't big. I want more about the story!
1:50 aw bullies
The tamarin, or white hair monkey is so cute lol
Eyy, John Downer. I watched his channel, and he's awesome.
0:38 monkey dab!
if anyone can link to otter footage id be very thankful it looks so cute
I wonder if the animals experience the "uncanny valley" when they see those robot cameras.
cool and creepy
The robots think the animals are robots, too.
I love this channel so much!
noooooo!!!!!!!!! Turtle bot!!!!!!!
I love how society is so hypocritical, these people spy on animals with hidden cameras ,yet when I try to do the same thing to humans i'm called a  pervert and a creep...stupid
there's another video of the monkeys when they drop the robot. They actually have a funeral for it. It's pretty interesting if you can find the video
I remember watching another video on spy animals. These monkeys mourned the 'death' of one of the spy cams
Disliked because they are cumbersome and impractical.   Also, too snowflaky.
Was just watching videos on spy animals. I suggest watching the one with the sloth, it is amazing.
Aliens would do this to us.
thats a good idea
it's both crazy and amazing how we are able to create such realistic looking robots. makes you ask yourself if they use these type of robots on us to study us more discreetly #conspiracy
some people have the best jobs
Mating season be like: .........WAIT! YOU'RE A ROBOT?!?!?!
The guy is also a robot.

Loved the video as always!!
great video
What if i do one of these and some guy, who also watched this video, breaks into my house and looks in these places...
am i the only one who thinks that a good amount of people who watched this were looking for ways to hide their weed?
meth users will pay attention
... Unless they watch this video...
But anyone would steal Pringles ;-;
They aren't secrets now.
why you didnt remove the whole metal part of the pringles can and glue it to the lid of that small jar and just put some metal in to the bottom of the jar
What about how to hide a safe. The type that is hard to move.
If anybody has any gay questions, ask me. I'm gay.
Love this video the only problem the rest of the world now knows what I'm hiding in my house xxx
*or you can just buy a safe*
how to hide drugs. starring HouseholdHacker ;D
yeah good but what if the theifs steal the clocks or books?
who here used this to stash their illegal substances
4 ounce jar? Definitely good enough for me 😉😂
I just came here for know where to hide the weed 😂
Hiding a key outside your house is just plain stupid. Criminals watch these videos too.
What if the robbers includes the clock?😂😂
Pringles can. Really? What happens when your friends throw it in the trash? Absolutely genius.
ha now all the robbers know where to look
NOT LOVECRAFT!!! ToT
No offence but what if a robber sees this video and tries all these 💡
" Honey, where is the Pringles can?"  " oh I finished it and threw it out"  "SHIIIIIIIIT"
But what if someone loves cheddar Pringles and takes them.  Didn't think of that huh
6:55 what the YouTube channel on the play button, For Surpassing???
Who wouldn't want to steal pringles.
Won't someone throw the lemonade away if it's gone out of date?
Did you waste flavored water? Did you save it, please, I hope you did.
You are awesome
BUT IM STAY IN DORM ....  But I already know first
perfect to hide weed
drugs you mean how to hide drugs
But what if one of the 200k people who watched is a thief?
6 interesting waAys
How to hide drugs 101
I'd steal Pringles
just so you know, the bottle safe is kind of obvious as the color of the lemon lime liquid is a reddish color
i Just cant make a pringles safe cuz ill just eat all of the chips.
I wanna da clock
wait cant robbers watch this video
How are these items hidden when there is 4.4 million people watching
at 4:46 at the right of the screen there is a lady bug
Uses it to store drugs cops come to search for drugs
All these " safes" are meant to hide your weed.
IS THAT THE DASANI COMPANY?!?!?! I HAVE THAT AT HOME!!!!!
Subscribed for the watch
Who else went back to see the thumbnail to see if it said saffe or safe
I am using all these for weed.
Can I have the premade clock plz
Greetings from Australia. Love your ideas. They are really great. Thank you.
Shut aren't you famous enough for the thief to know where the secret stash could be hidden??!?
You should do a video on where to hide a spare key on your car. That video would save my life!
what if ur mom throws away the empty or expired can of Pringles?
"Just put a little glue
Hopefully I win, since my birthday is soon
If you hide something in your ass it's unlikely someone will find it. There is enough space for a cell phone, cash and an 8 inches.
you have the Cory Cats 🙄
Great video
Wait it's not secret anymore if people watch this
As a weirdo i would steal your books and your Pringles
I think your homemade thermometer one would be better so that it would be more discreet. I'm sure the neighbors or the like would be able to see you push up the thermometer to get your keys
(burglar watches video) welp better look in those places.
Thanks now I can hide my weed
I cut up my bible trying to fit the box in
hey man, while you were out i ate all your pringles. tossed it out since it was a dud bottle. oh and i took some of your water or soda home with me. hope you dont mind. (and there went two safes)
Let's be real. Most people watching this are finding places to hide pot
600 comments
None of these are big enough to hide my dead bodies :c    it's a joke NSA chill....
I have an idea! Hide stuff under ur mattress
My mom puts money in the freezer hidden  Me idk where  I just know she puts it there
What is one of your family members throws away the pringles can😂
i want that for my home
I subscribed
well shit This giveaway is open to residents of the 50 United States or the District of Columbia. Thank you for your interest.
Wowow thanks householdhacker! You really helped!
It's funny how my neighbors have the sprinklers in their yard, but doesn't turn on.
i like your videos plss make many video
I'm sorry, did you just sacrifice an H.P. Lovecraft book for this?!
the clock is not a good safe because the robber woyld take the clock and see the safe
The added weight from the glass container in the Pringles and bottle will give it away 😒
Very bad idea for me my wife is a recycling freak
he's putting them out of business...
Not so secret anymore are they?
I need a safe Because My Family steals my stuff
dat's a terrible daytona yacht master rolex
IT'S NO LONGER A SECRET WHEN EXPOSED ON YOUTUBE !!! WOULD NOT FOLLOW ANY TIPS CAUSE IT'S NO LONGER A SECRET !!!

Lebron James is Awesome Chris Smoove cheese...

repeat st8 up
Thank you Chris Smoove The Raptors are not better than Cavs
Kyrie just unlocked that Hall of Fame ankle breaker badge.
lmfaoooooo @ "give that guy a mmmmmmmmanual
Kyrie read the shit out of his feet, soon as he bit on the left fake he blew right past him sick man
Kyrie did that Kobe spam 😂😂😂
Happy Birthday
Cavs vs warriors?? again the same?
Cavs is just having fun out there in Game 1!
Raptors always beat themselves tbh..
That last clip of Ky-ree dancin' 0.0
KYRIE WITH THE RIGHT STICK 2K CHEESE "OHH BABYY"
dag, RJ still in the game.
Kyrie is a savage!
Why didn't LeBron just ask for a nice cold refreshing Sprite? Ahhhhhh
#roadto2.5billionsubs
that's a smoove move
1:35 lebron grab beer and almost drank it
I wonder who's the next Lebron?
You forgot about the Ejection
Givevev that guy a Manuel
Givvveeee thattttt guyyy a manualll
kyrie just aint fair
I don't agree with that statement go raptors
raptors for life #beastfromthe6
spammin the right stick lool
Why would dude guard kyrie that close lmao, he literally asked for that lmao
kyrie is some cheeseeeee
Lebron knows better to stay in the Eastern conference....easy road for him to the finals
you tell the true
cavs in 4 or 5
The Raptors are so bad bruhhh lmfao Stay in Toronto where you belong haha
I'm sorry but it's gonna be Cavs vs Warriors for the 3rd straight year......again
That beer 🍺 is worth millions now from one touch 😨
Another Championship for LeGOAT
LeBron thought it was a Sprite
CAVS HAD ALLLLL THE CALLS
Shump's face at 2:15 lmaoo 😂😂
yall musta been born yesterday if you forgot Cavs blew out the Raps last year by 30 in the first two games LOL
Krueger had that ty Lawson spam on 😂 I think kyrie was watching hankthetank before the game 😂
Kyrie got that Kobe mentality
They stay fouling LeBron watching the game on TV I didn't know how much they foul him.
wouldn't it be cool if 2k had that Intel 360 thing
JR was ready to drink he sensed just a little bit alcohol and almost turned into the henny god
Give that guy a MMMMMMHHHHHHMMMMMMMANUAL
Kyrie Irvings handle is so tight 💯
that dunk tho 🔥🔥🔥
Lmfaooo kyrie spamming the between the legs then speedboost out of it 😭😭
I died when smoove said"right stick 2k cheese" lmao but yo check my beat out on my page please and thank u
Make Smoove an analyst
Give that guy a mmmmmmmmmanual
you gotta love the cavs' camaraderie, it's great to see the big three gell, especially kevin love
Lol taking exactly what Barkley said" they don't believe they can beat the cavs"
Right off the bat we see LeBron James head-nodding to the Chris Smoove soundtrack ayyyy
i see a sweep
Cavs Poaching some Raptors and the Rockets sending the Spurs back to the stone age
Cleveland haters have been silent for a minute 👀
he rlly was abt too drink that beer😂😂, untill he noticed it was beer
Love theses vids man keep it up
Shumpert has more options with his hair than I do with women
The raptors chose is in the wrong round at the wrong time
bron thought he was drunk for missing that easy lay up lol
I called a sweep of the raptors , let's see if I'm right.
Damn Cavs, these people have families...
Give that guy a mmmmmanual
Kyrie just speed boosted with that right stick spam cheese
We need them Bucks to beat the Raptors and Gianni's making 100 points for 4 games with the sweep
Start norman powell
1:30 Your welcome
"these 2k dribble moves are unrealistic" my ass
where is that guy that said raptors in 7?? i told you dude..the sweep has started!!!
Why is Smoove such a fucking raptors hater!
LeBron think that drink non-alcohol
Y'all tripping, Raptors in 7.
Shumpman with the lit dunkkkk 💣💣🔥🔥
Already watched the game but.....        When Smoove is commentating,its just better
Rockets are going to sweep the spurs
ibaka 3 point shooter now lmao
how come ESPN or TNT hasn't giving you a call about a job yet? Next Stuart Scott
Show the score at the end of your videos
If LeBron had taken a sip the league would have suspended him for a game I bet
I don't care if I've seen the game. I will watch chris smoove.
Where was the so-called LeBron stopper?
Who is better, Kobe or LeBron
this is how u ruin a masterpiece. Never thought about such a disastrous version of my all time fav
YAY THAT'S ME!!!! =)
Only the Wizards dislike this...
I am a die-hard San Antonio Spurs fan however I am a huge Isaiah Thomas fan as of a couple of weeks... God bless him and I hope God Comforts his heart for his sister
Isaiah is a class act.
wait which one is IT tho?
let's go cavs 🔝
Guard him very aggressively but no fouls block his shots
How can people hate on Isaiah? He's such an awesome story. Last pick in the draft, did start his career as the star he is, and is 5 9' but plays much bigger than he is.
I freaking love IT
Thank you for your honestys
"I'll get fast shoes" 😂😂😂 now that's adorable
as kids we think shoes will literally make us faster that's soo true
Russell...um, did you guys lose the game, or did the Jazz win this one?
rough crowd
awesome team work
Lol this is hella funny put them fast shoes on and chase him 😂😂😂
hey every opinion is valid.. and u know he lowkey really wants to know lol
IT prolly doesn't know he's recording them LMAO
Isiah is such a fucking G. Revitalizing the Celtics' season, playing amazing despite the tragic passing of his sister, and having a stable family and attitude.
Is that Donald trump in the background at 0:20
This guy deserves a championship ring
Isaiah Thomas's son is going run on the court rocking some light up LA gears.
Aweeee😍😍-coming from a wizards fan
NBA EDITS HERE HOT AND READY
Where is the people
0:18 I thought that was Trump in the back.
Don't. Let the nigga drop 40 and put up 53 yourself. Fuck a defense.
Isaiah Thomas is a national treasure
As the annoying announcers say "the little guy"
Is it me or was that guy stalking or spying on them?
Players always underestimate the importance of "fast shoes".
Oh shit lmao I was stoned when I watched this and I just realized theres no people in the stands and the father is asking him the questions lmao
You don't need to guard Wall. He'll just huck up a three in the clutch and miss it.
i wish my videos were this cute
Who's that big dude asking Isaiah questions
I'm a jazz fan, but I hate the Warriors team so much I can't even watch the series! I switched the channel last night to Independence Day....shiiiiit
John wall would show that kid no mercy and drop a thousand on him
this nigga who plays on the court is asking his son on how to play, fucking idiot, your supposed to teach him
That's a good dad right there.
all of a sudden everyone is a celtic/Isaiah Thomas fan
sadly here comes to bandwagon fans rolling through, next season Celtics fanbase will have a huge Increase of fans that can't name two players on the team
john wall is my favorite pg in the nba and next to him is IT.
"How do u stop wall?"(Thomas)  "I hurt his teammates"
Fast shoes, haha
Witch one is Isaiah?
Who are these people?
Great to see Isaiah in good spirits!
Maybe grow a foot?
wtf no one is watching lol
What an unbelievable leader and role model. Teaching the fundamentals of hard work to become great. Much respect to a terrific ball player.
"fast shoes" lmao i thought similar things when i was his age
I need to get me some of those shoes
IT lowkey bragging on himself
Lmao to everybody saying "just put avery bradley on him." Dude still dropped 40 points
which one is Isaiah both of em are the same size
This is beautiful
Put Avery Avery bradley on his wack ass and Drop 53
You don't defend him you just let your dad put up 53 points on him
answer: put avery bradley on him the 1st team all Def  and score 53 pts
GREAT  father son moment.
dosent he have 2 sons
Good luck cutie pie! John Wall is awesome but so are you!
man this guy is the best..
was this sneak recorded
This is adorable.
where are the white (sweat)pants from that you are wearing with the cropped flame sweatshirt? I neeed them 😍😍

I don't need to understand the language to know I like this song
I like how he just goes to f-ing town on those cymbals at the end.
Whenever I want to get that testosterone kick, I watch this song. Especially that step 0:18 and 1:10 - Brilliant.
Wow, a manly dance. Ganesh Acharya and Ranveer rocked this perfect choreography.  The song is like walking a thin line. A little different and people might have questioned how a warrior can do such dance.
Damn the lyrics and Vishal's awesome voice, this song is perfect for this movie.
Lyrics, anyone? (with translation pretty please)
I fux with this
wow what a choreography!! awesome!!!
Bollywood, please never change.
Whole squad fresh af
My gods that was amazing
These guys go hard as fuck
1:26 Wendy's social media managers when they come to work everyday
Who's here because of Wendy's?
In India, Marathas ended the Mughal rule (effectively). And Bajirao played a great role....
ranvir is the best .. ilove youuu
The manliest scene you will ever see in a bollywood movie.
aurangzeb fucked up mughals dynasty , fucking extremist ruining every good name.
I'm loving this choreography!
Hot. Dang. I cannot wait to watch this movie. And I rewind a lot. This is going to be an all day affair.
what a song!! always motivates me
I keep hearing "Fuck the Lau-lee", who are they and why is he so angry at them?
Man i just want English subtitles so i can know whats being said and sing along :P And i wish i could see this movie. It looks really good :o
Squad goals
So.. This is who Belisarius fought. Figures.
How the hell did this song has so less views??
found this thanks to 9gag https://9gag.com/gag/a8ynpnd
Feeling urged to create 1000 thousand YouTube accounts just to like this 1000 times. Thank you for this beautiful piece of art in all aspects. :)
God damn India's army is fucking lit
Imgur brought me here
1:14 he missed a step, im tilted
Knowing bollywood he's probably singin about how much he loves sweet girls, wants to buy them flowers and serenade them with his lyrical poetry...
Jai Maratha from Tamil Nadu.
I could see this being part of a musical.
i dont understand what they say but damnnn i envy his glorious mustache
can any one show me this with English Subtitles??  please?
Someone link me another Bollywood song sung by men thats this good. this was Awesome!
This is me at work, erryday.
1:45 is how I act when I'm about to win at magic the gathering
I want a curry now.
Damn. That was some TIGHT choreo!
3:06 dude's going ham on those tiny cymbals.
Imgur brought me here and I was not disappointed.
This just reminded me how much I love Bollywood. Used to watch so many movies <3 Time to start again.
dude's wearing a dress
this the type of song that you hate and love the same time
I think it's a festival party. I'm​ in love with the guy in the middle. he's so sexy. I love his dance moves. OMG!
The bhraman warrior
mhntl tr ekdum khatroooo
Just out of explanation
FOKING AMAZINGGGGG
BEST OF RANBIR
if we hear this we should dance because it is a energetic song
rs is energy generating plant ranveer is just simply great
India should be a Hindu Rashtra.
At 1:14 I had a flashback to Elmo from sesame Street doing the same move
i really need the tabs for this music
super energetic song, I wanna dance
Such a great warrior was PESHWA BAJIRAO, shat shat naman .
What's the time signature? I know you can beat a simple 4/4 against it, but is there a more natural signature for that alternating compound/simple time pattern?
I am a great lover of music and dance
what a energetic performance.. ranveer k energy se back dancers ko  notice kiya toh no comparision what a energy level..nobody can match
Available in ITunes?
he is carzy but still hot 💔🌚✋
jai maratha
nice really superb nice ..
Thought the show had started feeling a bit one-note... til this one. Way to bring it back, guys. Great balance!
always new wog boy was homo
brett got a tiny bit better but he's still a prick
great episode this one... quite deep actually! Well done guys. oh and that regional... so accurate
I love this show let's get this show on Netflix
WHY ISN'T THIS A NETFLIX SERIES THAT I CAN BINGE WATCH ALREADY!? I watch so many tv and movies, but this is honestly one of the best damn shows going.  Keep it up, creators. <3
bit too serious need more customer interaction ...
Ok can someone please tell me I'm not going crazy? Does it look like spencer (fart dude) avoid looking into the eyes of everyone he's talking to and just stares at their mouths?
You know unless Brett pulls a dick move to get a promotion he might be on his way to being decent
dude I fucking love Vish
Really digging this show! Greetings from Portland, Oregon!
I feel so bad for Gary is episode 😔😔
A childless career woman resents Brad. Typical archetype.
Confirmed.   Tess is a Slut.
nope, the moment that ultimatum was created I would have quit in the blink of an eye.
i like how there is more of a story in this hopefully it builds! great work guys!
1:21 the white board in the background!! "How to be a photographer: 1 take lens cap off 2 point camera 3 press button 4 get paid 5 have HUGE ego"  It's these small touches that push this show into greatness!
Wait! Did she just demoted Gary or she was threatening on demoting him?   And I really wonder what Gary wanted to tell Sean....
Wow they even had the classic mud cake this show is too good
hOLY SHIT everything that comes out of Vish's mouth is fucken legendary
I was cringing so much this episode
Fuckin Great Show !
They're really grinding that promotion that may not come
The kiss part was just plain weird.
Shaming him for wanting to go to his child's birthday party.  Requiring that they sacrifice everything to "show dedication".      This show really captures the life of retail work.
Every episode just makes me love this show more and more. Thankyou!
I wont mind paying for NetFlix when this show starts airing on it. Worth it👍
Brett is a good guy
HE MADE IT, thankgoodness they didnt script him to whimp out, wouldve been fucking frustrated as fuck xD
MOOOOAAAAARRRRRRRR!  It makes me sad that these episodes aren't longer
This show is legitimately better then 95% of the shows on the comedy channel. 10/10
Ugh. Watching this gave me flashbacks to my last job. Fucking management...
Mud Cake from woolies for your bday, spot on! :p
that was great,if you come in i fuck your shit up
Can't wait for Episode 6!
I wish I could work on something like this. <3
Also, where is Darren?
Vish is a legend
That group singing Happy Birthday was more on key than any group i've ever been a part of.
Spoiler alert "Vish gets the promotion"
I fucking died when they kissed
Why not have party on his day off
The face on Vish at the kiss. Hilarious!!
29 dickhead managers disliked it
Who the fuck here does a job because it 'makes them happy'?  Fuck off.  No one wants to waste their life working and no one every said on their deathbed 'I wish I worked more'
Tess is a manipulatively dirty s%#t
honestly, i would've punch that bitchy regional manager
God this was a kinda cringey episode
$229 for a kettle, seems reasonable
fuck me brett is a funny cunt :')
I've replayed the second-to-last scene so many times! Love it!
so is stocktake like inventory I don't work retail
LOVE this series. <3
Bring back the pilot episode tess!
love it!!!!
This show just got 10x better
I work in retail and this show is so spot on. I can relate to everything
haha head office lol, what a joke
"Today, you know I come to work and I see this fucking middle-management wannabee missing his own son's birthday party so he can fucking suck the corporate dick"  That escalated quickly lol
I have never seen a show so real about Retail until I saw Rostered On... Shit.  Fantastic shit fam.
This is probably my favorite episode I can relate to u guys in so many levels . awesome job ;)
i love this show
whats the song called when brett gets kissed lmao
I wish we had Vish...
WHAT A CUNT THIS WOMAN IS! FUCK OFF INTO A PRICKER BUSH!
Vish is such a fucking legend.
Fuck that head office cunt with a flaming chainsaw.
best one ever!! loved it when winston came up and kissed brett!! was deff not seeing that one comming
Really solid episode, keep 'em coming!
Honestly, other than the fact that this show could tone all the sexual stuff down a LOT, it's not a bad show. Way too much sexual talk though. Bit much with language too, IMO.
Best episode by miles, just keeps getting better and better!
Yo this episode got waaaay too deep lol
What's the song around the 18:30 mark?
Brett is a fucking legend
OMG when he went in for the kiss I DIED!! XDD
"Come on, bro! Who's your Bret? This guy~! Ah, fuck off, you dick."
The regional manager is someone you wouldn't even give the courtesy of a slap in the face, she is that much of a cunt.
I love this show because not only is it giving you a damn good laugh, but it's also gives lessons on life. Can't wait until the next episode, great job!
If Bret doesn't snake Shaun's promotion, he'll sort of redeem himself in my eyes. If he does, well then well played Bret... Well played.
Who the fuck gives thumbs down!?
Awesome again
Winston has cute eyes
Vish is the best hahah so funny - "piss off!"
They have it spot on when your trying to close and that customer wants to come in.
Wow as soon as i thought Brett was a fuck boy cunt. He was today's hero gosh i am growing close to these characters and being attached. Can't wait to see season 2 already!
He's also the ugly flash
I loved The Flash and Arrow but after a while the cringy acting and the budget level CGI made me stop watching after season 3's alien episode... checked back with this video to relive it.... still just as cringy xD
u were there, u lived it, u remember when u were me 😱😱😱😱😱
You were the chosen on! It was said that you would destroy Savitar not become him! Bring balance to the Speedforce! Not leave it in darkness!
High tech suit he got there mate
I think Savitar is the time remnant of Barry when he was fighting Zoom.  He supposedly burned up and died, but I think he survived and that is how "Future Barry" has a burned face.
LMAO in the subtitles is says: "I am the future clash" XD
So I'm guessing savitar is one of the time remnants that doesn't die when Barry fights savitar for the last time
And flash was the first speedster on earth 1 and jay Garrick said savitar was the first speedster ever
@Crazy A play, can you change the title please to just 'Savitar reveal'?
I can't imagine how oliver would react to this twist lmfao
the most obvious revel since the arkham knight
I like this music
No one gives a shit about ur spoiled episode you dumbasses stay off YouTube ! Thanks for the upload!
Dark Danny: I was the heroes future self before it was cool!
Consider me impressed
so why soes he kill iris?
it just keep s getting better and better
if i was savitar  for 24 hours there would be peace in this world
holy shit I knew it
that explains it in the comics  future flash went back in time  to kill himself
F***! Savatar told us so many times,   ' I'm the future flash ' , ' I'm the future flash '  I thought he said ' I'm the future , flash. '   'F*** you Barry'
Lord Vader would have been more effective in executing Order 66 if he had that type of suit.
WHAT MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT *IM THE FUTURE,FLASH* What it actually meant IM THE FUTURE FLASH ;)
He's out of his armor. Now is the time you should attack!!!
Thats not Barry, thats clearly Zamasu who took over his body.
This is when you noticed they revealed Savitar identity a long ago
Now when they fight we can ask Barry "Why are you hitting yourself?"
Reverse Flash is just smiling his ass off right now, just saying "I TOLD YOU you'd be the true villain! I told you so!"
whoah. future flash looks like Freddy Krueger.
let's be honest. if hero's live long enough. it'll probably drive them mad making them a villain
This means present Barry will eventually get as fast as him
So some point in the future, Barry actually surpasses reverse flash and becomes the fastest man alive
Eddie was related to him right
right eobard thawne had speed and
why Barry why not Eddie
why the hell every dc hero become like iron man
spoiler alert mother fucker
Wait hold up hold up is it really turn that future Flash is in like opposite like future flash is a villain or evil 😧😧😧
Why would Barry kill Iris?
Savitar should've went back in time and beat Thawne and Zoom's ass
i'm on barry's side fuck the other barry
THIS IS FUCKING BADASS
fuck you man you could just sayed 'Savitar s identity revealed' but no you had to spoil it for everybody who doesn't live in the USA
omg that was increiblemaizing xd xd xd
What if savitar becomes good in the end and sacrifices himself
what if Barry has a twin brother?
don't know why but the future flash reminds me of green goblin from amazing spiderman
People really don't understand human nature, normal people can be capable of great horror just as great honor and nobility. It's not unreasonable that Barry might have turned evil in another timeline.
What is savitar is using some sort of technology to make him look like Barry
When Barry overplayed Fallout 4
why does Barry want to kill iris l
Im here motherfucker xd
People say this is a stupid reveal, but I think it's a great. Barry must own up to his actions of messing with the timeline and fight his worst enemy, himself.
If he's from the future how does he look so young? Moisturiser?
I knew it I knew I knew it!!!! it was so obvious since he talked about how cisco could have been a god in the last few episodes only Barry ever heard that conversation. finally won that bet I made yess!!
When you see what's in the armor, he's suddenly not so scary anymore.
That's just to awesome.And just too sick...
How did someone so heroic end up so broken.
He's still hot even when hes evil and has a massive scar across one side of his face
Harry Osborne from Amazing Spider Man 2 XD 1:30
The suit looks cozy. Is there an air conditioning system in there?
0:46 it's as if it pains savitar to have to kill iris but if he doesn't then he won't exist as it makes Barry become savitar.
I fucking called it!!
I KNEW IT but I still sat there for a hour like WHATTTT THEEEEE HELLLLLLLLLL
So in the future Barry is a BAD ASS speedster and a killer. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN THE FUTURE BRUH😂
I can't believe it's ME! It's always ME!
1:30 when you realize you made a mistake
FUCK YOU IDIOT, YOU SPOILER ALERT BITCH THANKS FOR FUCK MY DAY IDIOT
What year is Sagitta from he doesnt look like the 2024 version
please put the link of episode 20..plz
The music here is on point
M. Night Shyamalan would say 'What a Twist!'
imagine if Ezra Miller stepped out of the armor
Oliver : You are not a god barry  Barry - Goes mad and kills Iris
lesson we learned, the flash is so slow, he is even slower than himself
I knew it! My prediction was right all along. I knew it couldn't be Ronnie because that would be too weak of an impact. Wow. That was a hell of an ending for an episode.
First time in 3 seasons I WAS WRIGHTTTTT...... yeeeaaaaaaaaa  or not :(
0:00 fans reaction who were egarly waiting for his identity
The phrase "My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive." For the first time, it's true.
Okey now i think Eddie will come back as Godspeed mark my words.
So does this mean that if there's a season 4 we'll finally get a main villain that isn't a speedster
Damn, i was so sure it'd be Ronnie
Did...did you eat drop or stroopwafels in the netherlands? They taste really good!

so cool, i would love to play with you guys!

HOLY FUCK THAT WAS AWSOME I'LL BUY THAT GAME IF IT WAS REAL but it's really dope
this was probably the most hilarious video I have seen this year 😂
The gun sound effects remind me of something... Oh yeah!!! Respawnables!
what Is clic
Your video is great ... My channel is also doing the same topic ... people come to see for me please comment ... thanks
Ian didn't send me, but i'm here nonetheless...
Cute Game. Like Your Channel!
this school shoudont have any pets
Its so boring and i cant belive i still watch it but its not really boring
its so beatiful
Very interesting and good drama...interested to finished watching all the episodes in the spring flowers drama...thank you
So many people in the comments complaining about the ride... I freakin' love it, its awesome.
If you could please hold a camera steady for just a few seconds longer on each point of interest.   Watching this is a dizzying experience.
universal has nothing worry about not a no were near as good as harry potter land  only good this is thereterand universal will build a flying thereter some time i geass
This looks as entertaining as IASM. Oh well. At least it'll eat some of the crowd. Flight of Passage should be good though.
Sorry, big Disney fan but this looks boring.
I just wish there was more of a narrative than "Look, pretty flowers and wildlife"
the comments are so negative but I literally don't care about any of that cause the shaman animatronic is just incredible I can't believe it!
Looks similar to Center of The Earth in Tokyo
Are there any drops? Or is it like Iasw😬
the animatronic looks damn good and moves to real, but the real question is how long before it starts slowing down
So excited to get to see this in August! Been following the project since I was 13 when it was announced, can't wait to really experience it in person.
This looks cool, but too short. I know some parts were cut from this video, though. I was hoping this ride would last for at least 10 minutes.
looks like it'd be cool as flip to see in person.  they should have gotten Deep Forest to do the music.  anybody remember them from the early '90s? lol
WOW, I think this might actually suck more than I thought it would when they announced an "Avatarland" was coming.  Horrible. Huge waste of money and space.
I wanted information, how much the attraction is, because it seems too short for the attraction Rispondi
Really pretty but that's about it. Looks kinda boring considering how much time and money have gone into this.
Is there any drop attractions magazine
Boring, boring, boring. The whole idea of Avatar is stupid anyway and this is all a waste of time. They should have scrapped this whole idea a long time ago and focused on Star Wars land earlier. Snooze
This is lowkey freaky
So disappointed. I mean, they did a good job, but really, who even knows or cares about avatar? Especially young kids?
Everyone's complaining about the similarity to other boat rides and how underwhelming it is but I'm here like dang that's incredibly freaking detailed! It looks amazing!
I love Avatar Awesome Movie and I love the Ride preview :) very cool :D
The playing of colors around the ride is a little off at some parts but I liked the the whole ride.
1:45 I am praying that the black area is a drop, this ride needs it
The only interesting part is the animatronic, the rest is a let down for how long it took.
Is there any kind of drop or hill? Any reason why there is not a wheelchair boat on this ride?
I swear this is just ET with different music and blue people...
Is this the animatronic that makes eye contact? Or was that a rumor that was actually fake (I'm not really following Pandora that much)
the most beautiful ride disney has ever made periode
OUTSTANDING!
That seemed really not exciting. I assume there was a giant show room that wasn't shown....
This kind of reminds me of ET with a better animatronic, kind of disappointing for something 25+ years later with more money spent
This is a great filler for Animal Kingdom, they really needed something like this, hopefully the capacity is good.
God Disney's attraction climaxes are just tech demos on new animatronics (same thing with the Frozen ride). Get some more story-telling creativity and then you'll be able to start drawing people in again.
How long is the ride
1:54 Eywa has heard you!
That is a very impressive animatronic
So, on a range from the Frozen ride at Epcot to Splash Mountain, which one does this more lean towards?
it looks very underwhelming
It looks amazing
another boat ride at disney..... shocking
Wow! This looks awesome! Is this ride wheelchair accessible?
And here I was expecting something similar to the Shanghai Disneyland Pirates ride. In essence, we got another "Frozen"...
what happened to the pov
I like the whole ride. Even the animatronic Avatar, which I thought was a real person at first because it looked so realistic.

Cute video. Is that a shiba inu in the background? 🐾
Why didn't you call the police? This is obviously abusive!
Some needs to put the batman song in the background
that's also 2,880 seconds, so what's your point?
And while this shepherd desperately tries to get herself a choice stick, the other dogs gather behind the nearest bush and gossip about her behind her back.
GIVE IT TO HIM!!!!
_Some say hes still hanging in there_
Dogs in America these days. Always the black dogs trying to take things that aren't theirs and causing violence. Sad. #MakeAmericaGrapeAgain
"she's smart" as they watch their retarded dog try to pull a branch off a tree with no success. WOW SO SMART NEVER SEEN A MORE TRAINED DOG MY WHOLE LIFE :O
The funny comments was better than the video!
If only he found the giving tree instead
Help the dog get the stick you savages
That branch is as hard as me.

when she knows it's too big but wants it anyways
Dog's just trying to get a good stick to fetch!
Rumor has it the dog is still hanging there
Doggo deserved the sticko
Where are the ENVIRO-NAZIS???

This is the worst film quality I think I have seen on the internet.  A huge waste of time.
thumbnail looks like my 6th grade social studies teacher
did someone notice nightmare foxy?
bullshit blurry fake ass shit
didnt even play the audio wtf
so what exactly have you shown us? Plenty of noise - from you that is not necessary, telling us what you think people are doing or saying. A mish-mash of nothing- if your honest!
Yes, cuz the thumb nail is SO real and NOT fake! Once my cousin dressed up as the boogie man for Halloween xD
If these are real boogyman i wanna see them dance.
Do people film with there toasters?  the camera quality is crap. Dont know what I am supposed to see.
what a shit video
No.3 the waterfall video, might actually be Bigfoot. Very interesting.
The third one looks like eba gogo : the hairy and unevovled apes who are cannibals and also a legend. They live in Indonesia (not confirmed)
ayyyy at 2:09 thats a nightmare me
Who thinks this Is fake 3 looks real but the rest wtf
it's all fake it's been edited it's all a lie
if the video is 144p it's fake
honestly I thought u were gonna say obama is the boogeyman
nice  send them here
the creature in the woods is groots
wtf guys are you trolling subscribers ? there is no fucking original tape with proof that there is fucking man out their.  seriously you guys are wasting peoples time ... #unsubscribing fuck you mfs
Overall one of the shitiest videos I have ever seen! Makes me wanna take a dump on the video then another dump on that one.
more vidio, less talk
at number 5 it is slender man
number three..there is more than one figure to their left
the #4 was optimus prime
For a start. the 1st one is classed as government alien. As iv'e seen it many times on youtube. The last video shows fuck all. click bait central. go find some real shit.
I want to punch you in the face for making this dumb ass video
in top number 4 is that the rake
1:50 HEROBRINE
I gave the boogy man a box of tissues
4 has Been proven to be fake
nonsence people who belive that boogyman is real bhuahaha
only saw 3 out of 5 videos. the other 2 where just dark with the narrator's voice
bruh i cant believe this guy posts thi shit
bollucks!!!! actuly letting us watch each video without you talking would be better
Click bait. Where is the picture from the thumb nail? Thumbs down!
So the creature shrieks but you don't play the audio??? Absolute fail
What a load of shite
god fake assholes nazis losers
The number 4 is the goatman
I like your voice, but I didnt see anything..  Reminds me of the guy from the Twilight Zone  Thanks for not using a computer voice
biggest waste of time ever
You're definitely retarded, you will never be a member of Skull & Bones ☠️

Much better script. Vid was lame, but hey, it's a start.
ok on the last one WHERE!?
on number 3 I looked at my pants quickly for some reson
I subscribed
it is not reel stop
what is a boogeyman i havent watched the video coz im scared 😔
if ur not gonna even  try to look into the stuff your talking about to back it up a little bit more then just a few words a top 5 video should be longer then 5 min should put more effort in your vids bro
Why go to the bother of stealing other people's videos then not showing them?
faaaake real life my ass
The second one is fake
boogeyman was a WWE wrestler      he returned to WWE 2016     hes gone again :(      he always said "the boogeyman is coming to get ya" he was so cool
2017 and the quality of videos is like from 2008 phones...
u guys no that non of this is not real right
this video sucked because we could not hear or watch videos with out you talking over them
First one is fake
you cant see shit becauae your edits are bad
toucans see shit becauae your edits are bad
on the third one with the waterfall. i only paid more attention to the left side of the bushes. there you can see someone standing there
Why is it hard to catch the boogeyman or boogeywoman and aliens hard to catch on film without a clear pic and controversy?
0:31 PITCH BLACK

Gee, I guess people were not cheering cos your just not funny, and your hair flick to the side of your head is just plain ugly and sad.
Since I'm not from America and don't know its history too well, I didn't get that John McCain joke. Could somebody please enlighten me? I'm curious.
this is getting annoying, all of the jokes are about trump.
Filipino dictator really? I didnt know the international media is being manipulated until this
Conan is so funny
I have a new sketch Idea for you, I really do, and you can use it free of charge, it is called " the guy who doesn't put so much effort in his lies", and kinda of speak for it self .
Why dictactor??? he was elected
having heard nothing from this monologue yet, I will take a guess and say it will have at least 4 trump/trump government "jokes" in it
Incident transmission widespread run white about literature.
Conan's self deprecating humor is by far the best of all talk show host. He is so good at making fun of himself and his failed jokes. and this is coming from a Kimmel superfanboy.
If jimmy fallon was funny he would Conan !
Honestly, one of the weakest monologues ever. But I love it. #teamcoco
Conan is the best.
Duterte might not be very progressive, but he was still democratically elected and is certainly not a dictator.
crap pool i guess  truly  uber vldio$shuttle  8‑d
this is pure CONAN and i love it ¡¡¡¡¡¡
That crowds laugh sounds like its automated
"Tryle Festival, yo" -Ja Rule
That nasty old war-monger McCain is the last Person to have prevented a war.
Conan's delivery is priceless (y))))
i love you conan . but please . try to go to the philippines. check our world. you will realize brutality for the love for one's country.
rodrigo duterte is not a dictator, yet. lol
Didn't Obama say Castro was a great leader?
i wish the "whoooo" would just stop.
Conan is the best at turning a bad joke into something funny!
After looking at Conan hair, i suddenly want to 🏄
"Brutal dictator"?  What is this... soviet style propaganda?
Conan, Duterte is not a dictator. He is a democratically elected official and he has the support of his people.
Whether Conan bombs or not he's honest about his monologues. Love it!
Fan correction : 3:44 no one downloads porn anymore
Wow I came soooo early.....
Don't go political Conie!
Lmao about that joke frye festival it was horrible lmaoooooo
What about killing kimjung un
ill come be a writer while the real ones bitch about whatever
"...talked to Lee. talked to Grant..."  I even talked to Andrew Jackson and Reagan.
Conan's amazing
It's funny when Conan's jokes don't go over with the audience.
All his monologues start with a TRUMP joke lately 😂   I get it, TRUMP and JOKE work seamlessly together...
bring the orange logo back
Conan is the funniest talk show host!!
don't so drugs stay in school!
What a load of bull - give me a break
My husband just got a job at an aquatic and fitness center. He just began working with a group called THE WOUNDED WARRIORS!  He is helping to rehab them. Wondering if this would be the same organization?
how would you react to domestic violence against men
Any other nonprofit does the same thing. Non profit leaders are paid inordinate salaries and obtain enormous perks.All at the expense of people who buy into the bullshit sold to them and who donate money.
WOULD YOU PLEASE RE-RELEASE THIS WITHOUT ALL THE ANNOYING MUSIC?

8th. Comment
I like this video, very creative.
That is so cool!
Portuguese beer, Super bock! very nice!
There are so many movies out right now that I want to see
Bat in the Cave.... 🦇
Ily Mike but are you 90 or
Nope- the first Guardians of the Galaxy was waaaaay better, guys, but the soundtrack is equally awesome.
Has Fleur moved house recently? Her kitchen looks different than usual and I can't see the clock wall
I want Nando's too!!! 😭
Ah Mike that's awful. I'd go ballistic if someone stole our lawnmowers. Good ones are effing expensive!
Sorry Mike's tool was stolen.  I care!   Thank you for the vlog.  It was so entertaining as they always are!
LOL i thought the beeping was coming from somewhere in my house and started looking around classic
You know how the saying goes : the only bad run is the one you didn't do! :) Well done!!
Anyone else think it's weird that the alarm was just getting tested and then they get robbed. Xx
You guys are so cute in your car!
I was wondering what mascara you used?
Just when I think Mike can't be any nicer......he saves a lamb 😌 what a lovely guy! Love your vlogs Fleur x
Maybe tHis is really suburb-American of me, but maybe it was just a neighbor who needed a mower (or two? I admit, the story falls apart here...) and plans on returning it soon.
I'm a bit peeved that the misplaced mascara and stolen lawnmowers seemed of higher priority than the fundraiser link. My grandmother lost her life to breast cancer. Let's keep our priorities in line, yes?
Wow fleur didnt even care that mike's mowers got stolen. She was laughing about the whole thing. So effin rude.
There's nothing worse than a thief!!  Sorry that happened to you guys.  Hope they can track down the thieves and your mowers!
Note to self: don't f**k with Mike's mowers
Time to get yourself an Akita, Doberman or Pitbull.
Hey Fleur! What lipstick are you wearing in the Friday morning outfit?
At least he does yard work, some men you have to beg! 🚜 Every should strive to get a guy like Mike! Sorry about your mowers Mike! What goes up must go down! ⬆️⬇️
#SheepdeForce 🐏🐏🐏 😂😂😂 Mike's a riot! Those mower thieves will pay #MowdeForce 
I also only eat red sweets or only strawberry flavoured😂 nothing else will do!
So sorry about the robbery! CHEERS on running! Way to go. How did you decide on what charity to "run for"?
gorgeous dress. please can you share a link I couldn't get the brand? Good luck with the fundraising  😁 I just had my head shaved for Macmillan 😁
I understand Mike's anger. ...People are dirt bags....Pray they never enter your home & do harm to you or your fur babies....Stay safe....Love your videos...
where's the link to sponsor? I'd love to support your cause! edit: nevermind! saw the link below.
Hi Fleur, would you consider helping our dog rescue charity. We met you at Crufts last year. We have some very poorly dogs requiring surgery and need some fundraising ideas.
Crime in the UK?  I thought you guys were much better off than us.
My parents were robbed of some their yard equipment around $1000.00 worth couple years ago. They were not so happy!!
What eyeshadow are you wearing fleur? :) xx
Where is your small hoop earring from?
Are the cushions on your sofa from The Wool Room? I work there and they look quite familiar.....?!?! Love your videos Fleur!! Xxx
Portuguese beer, great taste Mike ! ;)
oh no Mike thats awful.. why do people do that doesnt make since to me..
We love you Mike ! So sorry for your loss...   :(
Going to miss this vlogging month. So much fun. Looking forward to JunedeForce and other months that will follow if and as you choose to do them.
Looking through the comments for the girl Fleur saw 😂
Super bock beer!! Great taste😊
can anyone update me on why fleur doesnt have her daith piercing anymore?
Fleur, where is your middle stud earring from? x
The guy in the ad for this video looks exactly like mike
I immediately panicked thinking 'oh no which handbags had the gits taken' but then I sighed with relief, sorry Mike but I hate lawnmowers haha, they ruin every sunny day in England.
why does the jacket look blue in my eyes...
Portuguse water and beer!!! You have good taste😘🍶🍺🇵🇹
Echoing other people's concerns about return of the a-hole burglars! Stay safe!xxx
Keep up the hard work Fleur, some people wake up to just take nice pictures on Instagram at least you're doing it for s good cause 👍🏻👍🏻
Stealing a mower to my husband would be like someone stealing my clothes and makeup!!  Ha. Tell Mike my husband clearly understands his anger. We love y'all!!  ❤️❤️😂😂
https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/Fleur-De-Force this is the just giving page!! Like this so people can see it and donate x
Sorry about the mowers Mike.  I am going to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2 on Saturday.  I can't wait.  It seems to have come out in the UK before the US.  This weekend is opening weekend for us.
Sorry if I'm being thick but can't see a link to sponsor you in the info box. Good luck with the run! :)
Sorry about you mowers getting stolen Mike some people are terrible human beings
I glad that you and Mr. MDF are alright, Mrs. FDF ! I saw the title and panicked! I hope you are able to get your mowers back!
Mike and Fleur are super funny :) Love the vlogs :)
OMG is Nando's a portuguese restaurant? Because your drinks were both portuguese! Super Bock is one of the most popular beers here in Portugal! And the food looked very familiar too... That's so nice 😊
When mike suggests you help your face was the best!! I watched it over like 3 times too funny
I was expecting a gun robbery all youre money gone and piglet as hostage but only this happend >:(
I haven't watched in months, but I remembering why I love y'all so much! Hate that you were stolen from. Thieves make me so angry! Also, Mike seems to have gotten more handsome! (Men do that as they age, apparently. 😋)
Mike was so tickled with his "sheep DeForce" comment haha
MIKE DE FORCE FOR PRESIDENT!!!
sending you support to cheer you on for your training!
I love running but there's been many a morning where I've swore at my bf on a long run 😂😂
You'd think country living would exempt you from thieves but they are everywhere.  Just more expense for you guys. Fleur I would be doing the same cussing and ranting if someone got me out that early too for a run.
Drinking a portuguese beer I see haha well and water as well. Nandos?
Portuguese beer!!!! One of our bests
Great job with the run!!!  You can do it!! So sorry someone robbed Mike's lawnmowers! Thanks for sharing with us.  Hope you have a great rest of the week.
Portuguese beer and water 😍😍 but mike you have to try sagres it is way better 😊 fleur you are like me i also "love" running 🙊🙊🙊 have a nice day you two 
Hi fleur so so sorry you had a your mowers taken its a horrible thought that people have been through your private things apart from that good luck with the running.xx😀
I need more Pigglet 🐶 I would also love to see a video about your lipstick 💄
you should change your title from robbed to burgled, there is a difference
https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/Fleur-De-Force Here's the fundraising link! Looks like a great cause.
So sorry you were burglarized.  It has happened to us too back in 2014.  Install cameras around your property and an alarm for inside your home.
Me and David (my boyfriend) went to see the Guardians of the Galaxy and it was fantastic we also saw Ghost in the Shell and it was a good sci-fi but not as good in comparison =D

was  good actor.
Have given this 1/2 hour.Not great
Funny film... If you get "in the mood", it's refreshing...  Thanks for the upload.   Shared on Google+
Love the old British black & white films.
I don't usually like slapstick all that well, but this cute film had me laughing over and over.
Nice little film, thank you for uploading. I thought I recognised the police constable at the end, and checked IMDB - it's Stanley Baker, who went on to star in 'Zulu'.
not in the least bit funny
What a lovely film, enjoyed every minute of it. Pure watchable nonsense.
i watch some crap me but really enjoyed it
I stopped rooting for him in the final ten minutes. He really sinks to new depths of weasledom.
Good BR. comedy.
He walked an hour to work. And so many others did too. Today, a person would scream if they had to walk to work..!!
1:04:56 I don't know what the car is but would love to have it.  Can anyone tell me what it is?
If you are making this type of comedy, you have to go full Norman Wisdom, otherwise you just think, "what a fool this bloke is", instead of just going with the fun.
As a 14 year old in 1950, this film brings back fond memories of the past when my late brother Norman and I went to the Saturday cabana for children and enjoyed films such as pc 49.
An absurd film over the top humour ,and I loved every minute of it.
This is sort of "Benny Hillish" on steroids, but without the naked bimbos.
I laughed so much! Just what I needed! The old movies are sometimes the best.
I didn't know Dora Bryan had died in 2014, it was only a year earlier I helped her move some of her things from her house.
Look out for Stanley Baker near the end.
That was great
Yes it is but this one is a comedy so nice
great little film
This is HILLARIOUS!
I have seen some crap films in my time but this is the worst by far. Don't wast your time watching it.
just realised, this is based on a sherlock holmes story
it's mr pastry - nice one, never seen this one before, cheers
No love for the F-Bomb?
I had to log in just to aks 1 think. Did this guy say anything about that sexy erotic road runner at end of tokyo drift ?
Dodge 'Cuda?
How are you not gonna mention the badass '71 Plymouth GTX in F8??
what I'd love to see is the original ending of f7 before they changed it to them parting ways
I love fast n furious car
There's just something special about 90s cars
didn't even mention the gallo 12 or gallo 24!!
So in Fast Five the Chargers that they stole from the police magically morphed into the older models for the vault heist scene? 🤔
Not gonna talk about the twin turbo 350z?! Kys. Dislike
"Dodge Cuda"...?
1970 Ford Escort RS1600 is a rally legend
The Mitsubishi Lancer is an EvoVII(7). very awsome car
11:10 wait, wat
Go back to fucking street racing not this action movie
I was waiting for the 2016 Subaru WRX STI...
What about Sean's Monte Carlo? That was the best car
The white Supra is just perfect
thats not a 53 chevy...  its a 50!
Where was the Tokyo drift Monte!?
Missed out the punks white Volkswagen jetta from pt 1...... and the all black civics from hiest moments......
I want the heist chargers so bad
What about DK's 350z? That's one of my favorites.
Wasn't there a dispute about the cars in the first one? Something about the guy not getting paid.
Really? No mention of the 350z in TD???!
What about the F-BOMB?
The black Chargers at the end of Fast 4 are NOT the same as the cop cars! are you kidding me ? they're the older model! did not expect this from you dennis. You dissapointed me.
u skipped some good ones... the civics from the first film, the 350z from the 3rd, the trucks from the 4th, oh and the Chevy from the 3rd movie, oh and the Caprice from number 7. please revisit those.
black gtx? f8? gold gtx f7?
What about plytmouth gtx from fast8?
Why do you guys keep cutting him of?
i came here for the DEMON all i get is some fake ass robots.
Please PLEASE do an uncut version of this video so we can hear him go into detail about the cars and their modifications!!
There is no GT-R in fate of the furious. Paul walker. Wouldn't like this.
That Eclipse Spyder thoo.. love at first sight!!
I just wanna know how he got the tallest reverse gear in the world in that fleetline chevy....
11:10 I guess you meant Plymouth?
S15=A good introduction car for people who are still new to drifting
Dodge cuda ??? Dont you meen Plymouth lol
This is just a Subaru and Chrysler advertisement.
14:39 what about the lowered suspension in Brian's GTR??? He didn't say anything about that...
hi thanks for this
Didn't mention that Han's s15 had an RB26 in it.... you're stupid.
Feels like it's cut. When he talks, his voice is still high, ready to say something more, but it goes to the next car/movie
'Every Car,' more like 'About half of the cars'
Ummmmm. Just skip DK 350z?!?! Fml
"It all make sense" NOTHING in this race at the begining of 8 was makeing sense XD
The F-BOMB!!!! The FUCKING F-BOMB!!!! You can't forget that one!!!!!
y'all bitch and complain but still spend money to go watch them.
Leave him, this guy is a legend for putting all those cars, trucks and tanks in all the fast and furious'
The first two were great. Tokyo Drift was decent...after that...👎sorry to say. just mho
bro you left out the best cars and chose cars that barely had 1 minute on screen
With all of the 350z's in this franchise you didnt even talk about one...
Flip Car!? You mean Ramp Buggy
But why destroy so many reare and good cars why??????????????????
Whoa whoa WHOA! What about Sean's 71' Monte Carlo?!?
multiple miniture nitrous bottles... you mean 4 sneaky petes tagged together
wheres the orange challenger that was paired with the yenko camaro?
isn't the evo in tokyo drift a VIII instead of a IX ?
These guys trashed hundreds of mechanicaly brand new cars and i cant even afford to switch out my tires :(
How about,  lets go back to the movies being about CARS....not drugs or weapons, CARS! CARS!!!!!!
No Dodge Demon? It was teased a little bit in Fate of the Furious...
Where's the Jetta and 350z ._.
I like that car that goes fast...
All these comments giving this guy crap for every little mistake he made he literally talked about over forty cars in 19 minutes give him a break.
No mention of the Monte Carlo
forgot the 350z' from TD
holy smokes this guy talks faster than ff crew switches gears
Still can't beat the Eight Six on the downhill
Best job ever.
idk why but i listened to this while doing my math hw. Its so soothing
..love the series..the actors, cars. my only gripe..more Vipers! like what..one in Tokyo Drift a few mins? they'll kick ass and kick some more w/o tuning issues or breakage. boom.
This video is fucking stupid. I thought he was gonna talk about how be BUILT the cars, not just list them off and talk about the paint jobs.
The Chargers they steal is a different set of then the ones they use in the vault heist
why did u turn a movie that is about racing cars into politican things,tanks and military no one cares about that we wanna see heists,drug busts and fast cars
dodge everywhere..
He skipped the 71 Monte Carlo in Tokyo Drift!
I was waiting for the fast 8 white STI, come on
doms first charger is my favourite
What about The F-Bomb?
the s2000 was an incredible car from the factory lol. what a dope on a rope this guy is.
they mention the Jetta and Integra but not 350Z and Rx8 LoL
"Every Car Explained" "This is a 1995 Eclipse, it is green, it is Brian's. This is a 1970 Charger, it is Toretto's. This is a 240z it was popular." Great explanations, I have learned so much thanks to this video.
this guys kills cars!
Is this his new single?
Hey, it's Perry!!!
Wow!!! great Kenny Chesney !!!!!!!
Haha very cool.. I'm in the beginning, I see my back.. at 4:20 my face and near the end my hand putting the chalk down lol Kenny is the man! Very awesome song =]
Kenny Chesney such a beautiful song and so true :), Like always you are the best :):) .  love You Kenny .  Dalila P.
I wish kenny would go back to his old style. But this song is good. I just need less pop in my country.
I needed this today
Gives me chills
The dude from Scrubs is funny
I don't like this song.. I mean it has powerful words but it just doesn't flow well..
I've never watched a beginning like this to any song but damn I had to watch this 😳
What a powerful message. Much love to all.
Thanks Anson
I don't see how Kennedy is not the number one paid country singer he is amazing
I want success, respect and most of all. Love.
Wtf Is this shit!? 😂 😂 😂
did he rip this chorus melody from taylor swift?
Great thoughts put on the chalkboard followed with a great song by Kenny!
yes!!! songs like this is why i love Kenny. he's always got something to say....a point to get across to enrich my life.
Dr. Cox would make a pretty good professor
This was beautiful.
I am not an atheist I believe in god but these comments are funny this song has nothing to do with god it has to do with finding you
Kenny does it again !! Great song and video!
Too many artist going with that engineered bs and auto tune. The chorus doesn't even sound like Kenny. Quality lyrics but Kenny didn't do it justice on this one...damn!
Lovely collaboration with John Mcginley ! I've always learned something from Kenny's songs :)
the opening was eye opening, Kenny never fails to impress me.
Kenny chesney still at the top. One of the goats
this song has such inspiring meaning hats off to Mr Kenny Chesney ❤❤❤❤❤
All I can say about this song is, it's powerful. Everyone in the world should just listen to this at least once. Thank you Kenny Chesney for keeping it truthful.
Absolutely my favorite from my all time favorite artist.
What word is that girl writing at 3:46?
The Speech was the best part of this whole video... The rest was meh...
!CHRISTIANITY!
One of my favorite songs from him. I like the message.
This is one of the best songs so far! What would we each give back?
KC is the MAN!! If I could hang with any artist it would be him...with our guitars, old blue chairs, Cruzan at St. John.😎🌴
Love me some Doctor Cox!
Dr.Cox still hittin em with some heavy life lessons
Damn..That song hits you, doesn't it?
make  them  think  out of  box
that  good  teacher
kenny u did it again love u
Great song with a so many strong meanings!
Oh that was a good one!
Thumbs up for Dr Cox!
just ONE WORD .........JESUS
Kenny, thank you for the inner beauty that you have exposed to us all.
Oh. It's that guy playing the professor
I've loved this song since the day his album released. Amazing lyrics
AWESOME video the message is so inspiring!!!   💙Kenny your music is my favorite just like you are handsome!! Thank you for sharing your gift of music with the world!!  😍😍
Interesting lesson from the instructor, but a poor choice of a single, in my opinion. This song was the only flub on the album aside from "Noise."
Kenny, you need to get back to your roots.  This is crap.  Leave the politics to the politicians and start producing country music again!
True  word s and nerve give dreams up learn listen and think ;-) Thank you
How can one be in a Kenny Chesney video? Asking for a friend. :)
Fearlessness
To be happy: To help other people!
GREAT MOVIE!
absolutely  horrile. no one way in hell. I'm a  fan, but must be honest when it isn't working.   your slipping  Kenny. for God's sake
I don't like it. Go back to you're roots Kenny!!
Great song ...thanks for sharing <3
vision AND ACCEPTANCE!!! LOVE      THATS THREE HUH MY BAD
Great direction musically!
Love anything he does.  Never gets the awards he deserves, why?
Kenny just keeps blowing my mind with his insightful and inspirational song writing.
Who wrote this song?
kenny is my hero
The whole album is great
another amazing song. love your music
I think its a great song, but I don't like the video its too long til the song starts, still love kenney
Became friends with Kennys manager scot... So ive heard lots of stories on his climb to the top. Love ya and keep up the good work Kenny!
such an amazing video Kenny!!  This video says so much. I love it.  I would give everything to be joyful. The word is God and God is love.
I never cared for Kenny as a "country singer" period.  The beginning and throughout the song makes so much sense and the whole WORLD needs to listen with the intent of acting
There are a lot of people like that. I worked for some...
I hope he finds his happiness one day
Rape Me by Nirvana during the surgery though😂😂😂😂
TO INFINITY AND (5) BEYOND!
It's Babaduke CumInMyAss
YouTube, I've come to comment.    YouTube, I've come to comment.
Why do these keep on getting so many views!? I've tried and tried but still think these are the fucking worst videos. It's not Cinema Sins or even a satire. It's an idiot incorrectly noticing things.
Why did I comment
the moment when you notice that cinema sins dosent know how alot of things work
HAAAAAAA- *JAZZ HANDS BITCH! HUHAH!*
Why did you add two more sins? Why not one?
That's a lot of complaining. Your life must suck!
love how you say "mads as if he is "mad"" heh ;D
Sin 57. WHY DO THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO MENTION THE OTHER AVENGERS MOVIES?  Sin 58. WHY DIDNT THESE GUYS SHOW UP IN THE AVENGERS MOVIES?   Make up your fucking mind Jeremy.
You can't bring a wrist watch to a surgery. You forgot that. :)
What''s that 8 bit music?
this movie was total shit!
This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen
why does this guy unnecessarily roast every movie. like some points I get but some are like he's really reaching for something
The reason she couldn't see them astral fighting, but could see him before is because he came through the mirror dimension, you can see the proof around him.
The medical field abbreviates a lot to save time when writing reports. Much easier to write GSW than to spell it out
@CinemaSins You misspelled "dimension" at 15:06
Free Wi-Fi to a man who cannot use his hands GG
So i guess Le Chiffre decided that he couldn't beat James Bond by himself, so he decided to learn some magic bullshit in hopes of being able to use that, but instead gets his ass kicked again
You pronounced "February" wrong at @2:59. The first R is silent. Feb-yoo-air-E
Do you guys ever just enjoy a movie? like Jesus why don't you make the "perfect" movie since you seem to know everything.
1000 sins for casting Benedict Cumberbitch as Dr. strange
No one actually says the Hippocratic oath
What about Mr. Doctor being a *Strange* name? How did you miss either sinning or at least anti-sinning that scene?  5 more sins to Jeremy for not acknowledging the punny line!!
You removed two sins at the 'bargain' scene and then added 2 sins at "I usually have something to say in shots like this" 😕
13:30 that's probably exactly what they were thinking when planning this scene
I know GOTG 2 will make up for this trash movie. It would've been great before the first avengers but way too basic now.
4:44 Is's not impossible detective work...     If you're Sherlock Holmes!
This douche tries way too hard. The movie was great. However this video is trash. Does anyone think he's actually funny?
I really do think Stan Lee is The Watcher and when he passes they will make a subplot about it <3
So you remove 2 sins for the Dormammu scene, then add 2 more when you have nothing to say XD sneaky cinema sins, sneaky...
i literally thought all the things said about a month ago while watching this movie XD
everything wrong with sausage party.
A lot of these penalties were just character flaws. Those are there on purpose to make the characters more believable
this movie did suck.
You're still salty about Jurassic World's scene between Owen and Claire? Geez, get over it.
The best part was the Sherlock music. Throughout the movie, my brain shouted "Can he, please, stop being Sherlock for a sec?"
2 more sins I found.. 1.touching and wearing masks after u have apparently sterilised u r hands for a surgery.2. A normal ECG in the cardiac monitor while having a cardiac tampon ade. ..
14:30 removes two sins then adds them back with next sin, *cinema sins sin counter infinity + 6
I really wanted to love this movie, but it was just entertaining. I watched it last week and it's already falling out of my memory. It was a forgettable effort, 6/10 passing grade because it didn't bored me completely.
It has presented our country Nepal properly :)
The bald lady must have cancer
the new marvel movie intro ruins the simplicity the old one had
I like your channel man, but it seems like your newer videos are more opinion based than actual issues with the continuity.
"...that's so Starkly familiar" *BRILLIANT!*
Even tho that was 16 mins
omg the Sherlock theme at the end totally nailed it xD
I lost it when he laughed at the cape
the Sherlock music was a nice touch
Stan Lee's cameo in Guardians Vol. 2 does kind of call back at a previous cameo
so glad I didn't watch this crap
4:39 for a really obvious cut in Sin-ing
The watches spin because they're charged by physical movement. If you leave them motionless in a drawer, they lose time.
I watched this cuz I like Dr. Strange. Why bother picking apart a movie, unless of course it is your job (youtube). Sit back, relax, unwind and enjoy. It's fantasy after all.
Do The Book of Life!
11:57 since Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2 they do!
I have been waiting.
Great movie
You guys would have a field day with the new fast and furious movie.
This is just exhausting. Two minutes in and I'm done.
Funny he didn't say anything about the super villain being an evil space cloud. Just like the ones that appear in a bunch of superhero movies. (The Hulk, Fantastic 4(2), Green Lantern, etc.)
If the Strange magic men are all about protecting the word from magical dimensions, why isn't Thor invited?  In his movie didn't he say magic and science is one and the same?
One of the worst CinemaSins. Did you do any research?
everything wrong with the blindside
Disliked, title says 15 min and actual is 16:10: sick of clickbait
You gave yourself an infinite amount of sins?
"What the f*ck is Mordo doing here in the marketplace toda- He's just standing around..." Nice audio skills, guys.
where is the post credit scene
What injury did bruce wayne have?
i think the videos should become a little shorter in length... #IMO
You have to do Arnold's commando please
GSW is shortened because it's quicker to write, not quicker to say.
I'm sorry, but I can't contain my laughter whenever I watch this and you say "Here, here, here, here..." with the inflection you put on that word! XD
I thought they were building the Stan Lee cameos by telling the viewers he is the Watcher
HOOPLA DOOPLA YOU BIG SILLY GOOSE YOU JUST GOT *BEANED*!!!!
They probably say GSW instead of gunshot wound incase another patient heres it and wont worry or assume the worst
I really really want to see you sin The Godfather/The Godfather 2. (The Godfather 3 is not really challenging)
Do "Collateral Beauty" please please please
14:36 Sooooo.... no one is going to talk about how they had no right to make a sin... aaand how they put two sins instead of one.... anyone?
momo is funny clips

"Is it ok, if I sit with you?" Me sarcastically: "No." She: "Oh, shut up" Me: O.O
this video is very imaginative since it would be natural for whispering to occur since everyone else is asleep. im very impressed by this ASMR. the background is also incredibly relaxing. the fire is most intoxicating.
going on my DofE tomorrow, 30 km in 2 days with my mates, all for the duke of edinburgh, should be fun
You should definitely think about making a playlist, so people can autoplay these! Your videos are really comfy and good
TFW you actually do speak four languages. Immersion breaking 😄
Glow sticks rule, s'mores are totally tasty, & speaking of that great summer holiday, July 4th is also my birthday!!! #FireworkLady #AmericaRocks!!!!
You might just have the best ASMR voice, especially your whispering.
It's the same with me when it comes to tattoos. I dig people who have them, but I don't wanna get one myself. And damn, your hair is wonderful :c
>near end of video>cue Goodnight Moon by Go Radio <3
You have an amazing vibe! Keep up the good work!
"we've gotta get up early tomorrow"  me: ( u , u )... zzZZ  It's so damn hard to not fall asleep xD
can i ask what a smore is? Aussie here. cheerz
i would much apreciate it if you put your videos on a play list~~ keep being amazing :D
dude you are so fucking good at these, it actually feels like you are in the middle of the fucking forest LOL
I was stung by a stingray 3 times
I just found your channel and I love it. You're almost unnaturally good at casual conversation.
For a while I legitimately forgot I was watching a video o.o
4:39 Pop quiz: Of all the YouTubers, who's the least likely to be sponsored by Hershey's?
This was such a good idea for a video. Great job.
Jesus. Emo didn't even exist until after I graduated from high school. Now I feel old.
What happened to the s'more? They melted and burned out been on the fire to long! 😭 RIP s'mores
you're too good at this, i love it
We all went through an emo phase in one way or another...
I lived in the basement of a house that was in a Playboy.  Truth.  There was a pink antique couch in the living room that made it into an issue.
I feel like I can't watch these because I'm falling in love
OH! Ya, no that's cool just go ahead and steal my heart itz fine, y wouldn't it b fine?!?!.....
"I could never do theater"  >Does Roleplaying ASMR perfectly well. Erin don't lie to us /s
omg beckeiigh we could have just done this at a starbucks eughh.
Hey Blush, just wanted to say your videos are fantastic, keep up the great work! You're my favorite ASMRtist!
Every time I watch this character I feel I am hanging out with Margo Roth Spiegelman from Paper Towns. Every. Single. Time.
She reminds me of Hannah baker sm😫🖤
Acted and constructed quite well. Kudos.
*Can I sit with you?* NO! *Oh shut up* o_o *what color glowstick do you want?* GREEN! *picks the green one* WHAT IN THE!?! GET OUT IF MY HEAD!!
You remind me of Hannah baker
i think I'm in love w you wtf
I want to marry her tbh
SO LETS GATHER 'ROUND THE CAMPFIRE AND SING OUR CAMPFIRE SONG.  OUR  C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G SONG
Taylor Swift is a fucking normie
you look like someone I've dated a few years back
Please keep doing videos with campfire sounds. It's a very soothing. And you're allowed to love fire to the nth degree. A lot of us pyros out there ;)
She seems like the type you wanna smoke a blunt with and watch "It Follows" with a massive order of dominos pizza
7:45 You totally should've said "I promise I'm not an ASMRsonist" lol :D
Will you be my friend because quite honestly you are an amazing person.
Is it wrong that these ASMR video's make me horny, forget Viagra, watch ASMR vids.
"I probably should have invested in a better chocolate than Hershey's" I LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA, FIGHT ME OR GIVE ME THE CHOCOLATE
HEY DO YOU LIKE BEARS??
FRESH BLUE? YOU ARE SO CUTE ...I'D LOVE A SMORE BUT BEAR ON DIET...WAAAAAAA. LOVE YOU.
Great video!
who else picked the left stick?
I just discovered you today and you're already one of my favs ❤
I've never been by a campfire where the people whisper. This is kind of weird.
Her: we floated paper boats down the stream  Me: If you come with us, you'll float too. You'll float too. YOU'LL FLOAT TOO *WEIRD CLOWN MATING CALLS* *AS SAID CLOWN RUNS THROUGH THE SEWER*
I love videos like these because it makes me feel like someone gives a flying fuck about me
Erin:  "I think the lie has to be that you never went though an emo phase" Me, an emo: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, *squints* surrrrrre
burntidness?  10/10 would grammar again
Your videos are amazing! Thank you so much. Please keep it coming 💫
I hate forests, they have ticks and weird noises inside.
Why all ASMR girl are beautiful?
I once ate potatoes. Potatoes are actually really good! Like why did no one tell us? I think they eat grass tho. I did that too and it wasn't as great as the Potatoes I'll tell ya that
you're just...wow...thanks for helping me sleep again :D
Fuck you stupid bitch
Charming - face -asmr!!  Nice !  :)
Pfffffft I'm STILL going through an emo phase.
You're such a sweetheart, Erin. And a real cutie. With a beautiful voice. Lovely video, thank you.
hey as a boy scout this is a normal situation but it's everytime something special. :)
To be fair, the kind of cheap but not too cheap chocolate has a charm to it that high-quality chocolate just doesn't capture.
i honestly would like to see a video where we had a possible fallout in our friendship, idk i wanna go on an emotional trip. regardless tho, great video erin 😌
I got tingles from the very start :)
After months and months of no tingles, this video finally brought back some of them. Thx so much, awesome video!
I wish I had a friend like you
This was perfect for a mid-afternoon chill session while working today.  The fire crackling and soft storytelling, especially with the occasional whispering, makes this a gem of a video.  Thank you!
i think ur nice and a  beautiful lady  ..but why videos like this
Okay, but what's YOUR favorite Pokemon?
Watched this in endless loop. After 4 days i woke up.  Yes, im in the Futur.
erin: i love fire so much  me: that's creepy erin: yeah that sounded pretty creepy  me: I AM FREAKING OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING
S'mores and purple glow sticks? You are an awesome friend!
this feels authentic
will you ever do an ear-to-ear whisper video? I love your voice.
You are amazing :)
I wish I could talk to people like you talk to the camera :L Great video btw
somethin like
haircut and shave or
suit fitting
Wow, the fire burned so long without being refuelled with wood and it sounded the exact same the whole time wooah
Please do a coffee shop roleplay - like getting coffees!! P.s I love you and your roleplays so much <3
I hit myself in the eye with a flaming marshmallow once. No lasting damage other than my pride, but I do not recommend.

whaaaatttt that is sick
Love seeing Holliday hit some HRs. Such a good player.
I hate, really hate, the Yankees!!
damn finally we coming strong this year lets fucking gooo
No wonder NHL.com's recaps suck, they are using the same guys they do for baseball!
Yankees fans were in midseason form this game. Some nasty FIGHTS broke out before the comeback. What do you expect from DRUNK YANKEES FANS. You SHAME the CITY OF NEW YORK. DAM DRUNKS.
Jeusususususus I will die to be at one of those games
0:05 "4-3 Baltimore in the 5th..."   Scoreboard shows 4-0.
I didn't think this was possible!!
Trending...? HOW
There's a mistake. I'm pretty sure you posted the score from a Giants-Ravens game on accident.
Meanwhile, the Nationals have scored 73 runs in their last 6 games. Boring.
Go Mets Go Mets Go Mets The Only true New York team.
Man that was such a close and intense game can't believe we won! Let's go Yankees!!!
funny today in franchise in mlb 17 I hit a walkoff with Matt holliday
Making baseball great again!
i forgot about this sport
six still going all the way
The orioles should have won
gonna miss Holliday. just glad he's gonna have a great career as a DH
wow that was home run derby
way to go Baltimore! Not! !  pathetic....
i turned the t.v. off in the 6th inning . i guess that'll teach me not to give up on the "17" yankees
let's go Tigers let's go ..yankees suck
Go Yanks!!!
Hate the Yankees but man they have been impressive, could give my Cubs a run for their money this year.
Bronx bombers!
only a hundred and twenty something more games to go in the season!
How long has it been since MLB been featured on trending?
baseball is gay
The Bronx bombers are back!
Still pissed Matheny let him go. Cards have shit the bed this year. What a joke, good luck though buddy we in STL wish you the best.
Matt Holiday was better on the Cards.
Dont let this make you forget the 3-1 lead the Warriors blew
Fuking boring baseball!
Right after a hot shot roid juice
Yankees are so basic
But my coach said base hits win games.
Looks like the Yankees are finally strong again!
The Yankees came back because Greg Gibson, the home plate umpire, was motioning to both players..
Holiday looked better in a Cards uniform.  I miss you Holiday.
My Father just hung out with Matt all pre-season in  Florida! Shout out from Joe Z's son Matt!
how many games are there where EVERY run earned is from a homer?  Not a single RBI?
Castro's homer looked badass!
What's even insane is very few people in the crowd left the game
These ads get annoying. Any way to block them on iPhones?
wish he was still with the cards why did he leave?
would of been a hella good game to watch
Yankees all day
The orioles blew a 9-1 lead, good god
TOO NOICEEE
Not surprised
what a fuckin choke
New York State of mind
It ain't over t'ill it's over!
As much as I hate the Yanks, I gotta say nice comeback... not as good as the Patriots tho.
Matt Holliday: the strongest man to ever hold a baseball bat
BRONX BOMBERS BABY!!!!!
The Bronx bombers are back bay bee!!!
Such a classic Yankee win
why a baseball video is trending? nobody cares about it. only the fat americans because they love to eat for 4 hours straight.
One of the best games in Yankee history I'm a Yankee fan I was so happy when Matt Holliday hit the three run homerun
Who else fucks up a lead like that
Matt Holiday walks up to the plate in Bottom 10th Dad:Oh look!Holiday is up! Me:Ok game's over we win Dad:The pitcher is just winding up. Holiday hits it.* Me:Game over,just as I said
Aaron Judge is an All Star in the making.
Say what you want about the Yanks, but this was great.
So happy I was there yesterday ❗️
WHAT A GAAMMEE
BX BOMBING YO! ! ! !
And the Orioles still had more hits. Aaron Judge is a BEAST. #Let'sGoYanks
I watched this when it happended
The long tradition of the Yankees continues...WINNING!!
Thats f.   Uck in insane! Yankees back to what they do best the longball!
this makes me proud to be a yankees fan
damn congrats Yankees  I'm not a Yankees fan but I saw the score 11-4 I thought they were done for sure.
yankees are full of cheaters
If you like home runs, this is your type of game!
wooohoo!!! one of the greatest comebacks I've ever seen!
Omg Yankees coming in strong lets go!! One of the best games
what a game
Good to see Matt Holliday still swinging on the first strike even in NY. Haha that swing was money.
best freaking win thus far
God forbid you guys made a longer video since it was 14-11 game! come on
Yankees need to go out and trade for a decent starter that's all we need and we will be alright
Can't this lying piece of crap just go away!!!
Really? Should of asked where her emails are, the only thing she's capable of answering.
We don't need foreign policy advice from Hillary Clinton. *cough* Benghazi *cough*
MAKE SURE TO CHECK OUT MY NEWEST VIDEO :) and thx for all of the support <3  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV65hrzKuco
That first one is beautiful
I'm going to punch you and shit, but you can't punch me back since I'm a girl. It's the rules and its fair
oh gowd this fuckin bitches
first one was not savage it was cruel 😑
When u defend urself so much u send ur attacker into a seisure. I strive for that level of satisfaction
i wanna meet morgan. fuck double  standard
WTF HOW MEAN THE FIRST ONE
Bitches in the beginning FUCK YOU WHORES!
The first one true
it was so setisfying when he pored the water over the Woman in the first clip x'D
That video at the end Dont fuck with a smokers smoke they fight back
I wouldve bitchslapped both of these bitches in the first clip. Fucking disgusting; the condom failed on both of these girls.
The girl in the first clip is a little bitch
I'd punch anyone in the face if I seen someone calling anyone fat.
6:38 that biker doesn't deserve that that was a really bad bike crash people get killed some times when they are on a motorcycle just buy crashing also i ride a bike so not funny
In your face lady (on the first one). It's his right what he wanted to eat. :|
I wanna stab those girls in number 1so badly.😡😡😡
The British bitches at the start are just lmao
That first one was not savage it was a dick head move and that guy at the end was a legend 
at 12:09 i thought he said equality not property. i was like oh damn
This was no were near being a savage
Okay that first one had to be fake...
those fucking bitches got what they deserved but otherwise funny vid
brave thai slut at beginning respect bro
but than that bitch get revenge
1:17 ooo that was soo sad the fatty
funk those to girls in the begginig
3:23 failure. Just stop.
I want to give the guy in the first clip a hug.
first one had some fucking assholes in it
Sjw. Made this vid fuck him
5:24 "Racist" lady gets instant karma. not racist just a bitch.
the first video made me want to punch those women so hard do but when the guy pors his drink on her i laughed
10:40 That's disgusting. Sorry I'm dirty minded.
The bitch getting mad at the people speaking Spanish and not getting her order right by one ingredient is just mad bc she was reminded she can only speak one language
https://youtu.be/vzPVCWvMJvo?t=69 ur so rude, lemme bitch slap that shit
if girls want to be treated equally then it would be ok to hit her right?
Look I don't think hitting a girl is good but she deserves that because she swung at him
Man she definitely deserved that he dropped her
sometimes​ I hate white people
bitch what? that girl went after him she deserved to get dropped lol
At the first one I felt really bad for that guy like for the girls of go to hell
That girl who tried to fight the guy... her friends were to worried about pulling their pants up SO high so there butt looks bigger.
nobody tells me not to eat food I don't care what you think I am eating.
did this motha fuka try robbing a gun store at the last clip?
Dude im so fucking sorry for the First fat man... I mean, this girl is in a way right... He should rly stop eating there... But this is just too much... Well, Karma will handle it.😉
The first girls deserved it, that man did the right thing
the 1st one Is just harassment ..
I understand most of the things here but when the biker nearly loses his life its not even funny :(
I hate when ppl say "don't hit girls" and I'm a girl 😒
I am discussed from the first one I'm shleep bruh😪
that lady that said get it right the first time she kept saying get it right the first that rude to say to the workers and then she said get right the first time again and ran into a fucking door
There are 2 kinds of people the ones that sit like this 👉and the ones that sit like this 👆
When a girl is being a racist anti-fat feminist all-males-are-rapists, and as soon as they start getting threatened, start saying shit like "you can't hit a girl".
Yes I know that the first one was a experiment but who the fuck would want to do that. Respect to the guy that pored the thing all over that bitch
first one so tight
i feel so bad for that girl in 11:26, I know she was a bitch, but it doesn't mean that you can knock da fuck out of a girl or even hit her.
Is no one really gonna talk about 3:30??????????
12:40 the girl was acting aggressive towards him in his own yard, if you try to shit to a cop they'll pull out mace or a taser. He had every right to flip that bitch on the pavement, fuck her.
McDonald's don't even have salads
First one is say fucked up, that dude who poured the water is awesome
The bitches in the beginning are such assholes, if I was him I would have roasted them!
i would have done that too at 11:56 like seriously calm the f down
i wanna be the dude at 8:40 so bad
respect for that black guy in the first one👌
Fuck that British bitch
I fucking love that guy in the beginning lol she was a bitch both of them were bitches. I would do the same pour my drink all over her. makes me sick that they're people out there. but, at least there's people like him.
She didn't got the door the first time 😂
11:27 YOU GOT KNOCKED THA FUK OUT!!!!!
11:26 wtf she hit him lightly and he threw her on the ground and put her into a seizure. Wtf put that man in jail little bastard
the first lady was mean
the first one where they called him fat at least she she is a little fat so ducking off botch by the way I'm speaking british
i really dislike how fat people are judged
the first one the girl had her ass handeded to her
what are people trying to get them selves fucking shot
Yu speak English in America...do yu do that in nail salons
I had the biggest smile on my face when he poured his drink on her
11:13 if you loom closely, you can see he phone in her pocket....its broken now
8:36 what is this guy doing??
6:00 I see her point I mean they could easily have been talking about her in another language
aye girls/bitches reading this comment, boys will only give 3 chances. hit us once its fine, do it twice fuck you, third time we gonna drop the fuck outta you
The black guy in the first video is my hero, rock on dude.
I sad because that black guy just wasted 1$ on that bitch
You can't change a guy that got fat who cares
11:32 is JOHN CENA!
My moms called Lesley and talked about moving house recently lol wish it was me xD

Many of these are not errors...
The runners were clearly safe on a few of these...
No Ross and Rizzo boggled catch in the World Series???
A lot of these were from Hanley there was three in a row
Imagine an infield with Andrelton Simmons and Brandon Phillips. Hitters nightmare.
Seeing as half of these clips would have been scored hits....
No Petey and Boone?
Basically s Phillips highlight reel
You missed a classic... Rose / Boone game 6 1980 World Series. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2uGm6XEbLQ
First to reply is gao
iiiiiii subcribe. i love your video they are amazing
everybody's favorite the 5-6 foul out at 2:52 if your scoring at home, and if you are scoring youtube plays you need a life
Phillips is in half of this video
At least half of these aren't even errors
0:38 Brian Dozier holy fucking shit that was clean
0:20 what was the error?  that was hard hit and if it didnt hit his glove that's a base hit
Title had to be perfect recoveries
I subscribed !!!!!
It's crazy how little recognition these first basemen get.  A lot of good scoops.
many of these aren't errors
I understand that it must be difficult to come up with a title for a video like this but i would say a majority of these aren't errors at all.
You have to add the Orioles triple play from last night (May 2nd 2017) against the Red Sox. Hardy dropped the ball then they tagged the runner and got the force at first and second.
"Your dick hole trickles pickle juice!" I am literally dead.
That guy is so dead
this was great amazing
I am the very contents of a deadly illness manual.
Best short of the year!!
What is the name of the song this parodying
What the fuck is lupis?
I always hate musicals but this one is really the best
-Rudy Mancuso's Musical doctor is hilarious- *Cyanide & Happiness's musical doctor is hilarious*
When you finally find some more quality content      THANK THE LORD! I HAVE BEEN BLESSED!
Wasn't there comic from a long time ago that was like this? Whatever, now it's a song!
Who else wants to be told that they've basically died like this?
LOLOLOLOLOLOL
I have sickle cell
that's fucking hilarious
This is bot funny , its sad
What a sick video!
HIS FACE XD
Do want the bad news or good news or here a musical about it
My friend actually has Sickle cell
Way to revive an old comic.
why is this not on adultswim yet
one twisted nut
This was a strip long ago
Can someone please reply to me with lyrics 😂😂😂
I AM THE VERY MODLE OF A MODERN MAJOR GENERAL,
Had to turn on captions for this video
Ohy gosh his reacti0n
Me: Ow. I have a slight backache. Online doctors: *Begins musical number*
This is the answer if you ask google: "My left knee hurts. What is it?"
Rifftrax is the best
I muted this to hear from his pint of view
Me: "You're cancer." Someone: "You're so insensitive. There's nothing worse than you or a loved one getting cancer." Me: *this video*
This was actually pretty funny lmfaoooo
Is that Tom Servo?
Kevin Murphy is the very model of a modern general practitioner.
This is what those damn fidget spinners o to you kids...
I was expecting that at the end the doctor was going to say AID'S...
"Dick hole trickles pickle juice" So nasty, yet so funny
Might as well be deaf. Lab results are falsified to keep doctors out of court.So much for HIPAA Law.
Me as the very model of a modern major doctor
Finally a hilarious vid in what felt like forever.
What song is this to the tune of? It sounds familiar
I didn't know Colonel Sanders was a doctor.
It made me laugh and then I watched it again and it made me laugh again. C&H is dying
Aww and that's why Musicals in real life are unreal
This reminds me of A Murry Christmas.
This man must be invincible if his body is still functioning with all those diseases and symptoms
How many takes did this take?
....how do you sprain your anus😂😂😂😂😭😭
the end omg😂
the end omg😂
what was the deaf joke?
MAY THE 4TH BE WITH YOU!!! :D
He should have been blind aswell.
fuck you stupid
My school did Pirates of Penzance for musical this year, so this is pretty lit
what if your doctor always sang to you everything you have
When you're a med student and you understand every science term lol
All by all: you're fucked
if animaniacs where for adults only
"Sprained anus." Ha!
I am the very model of a modern major Medical!
Outstanding work!
I still can't believe C&H are still making twists that I can't predict
anybody else see this as a comic a few years ago?
So fucked😂😂😂😂😂😂
Family Guy - Down Syndrome Girl song
THAT ENDING WAS SO SAD
this man should of been dead
Not sure if that guy majored in medicine or theatre...
Google be like
😂 the ending though
I like how some of their videos are based on older comics they made. This one and the Tumblebutts one were both older comics.
Spoil :  Also you're deaf.
So basically the side effects of viagra?
Who else had to turn on the caption?
Lin Manuel Miranda really did his work on this one
Finally a return. of from for them
very old joke
This one is definitely my favorite already!
A great full fledged episode with great writing. Nice
So he REALLY can't be insured...
im scared now and I'm bleach like I'm supposed to be fearless
the best one far of all in my opinion. sent to every person i know. this was a perfect breath of fresh air explosm. loved it
i died when heard "dick hole trickes pickle juice"
I already knew the punchline because this is literally a rehashed joke from an earlier comic: http://explosm.net/comics/1849/  However, I do like how they expanded on this joke by turning it into a musical number.
My doctor did give me 1 year to live, so i shoot him and the judge did give me 16 year...
Is this thing in the browse of youtube every week?
Please site your sources.
OK. First we tax all religions. Then maybe go after pork barrel government spending. Then graft and corruption. Then Planned Parenthood. Do they ever mention that non profits are allowed to make profits?
Ahh the pp idiots that think a fetus isnt a life...yawn.
WITH 14 PLUS FORMS OF BIRTH CONTROL, WHY is Planned Parenthood permitted to use MURDER AS A FORM OF BIRTH CONTROL for women who have shown little respect for the life of the helpless child?
there are many good lawyers, then there are bottom feeding leaches like ADF.
I'm fucking done she actually thinks all Planned Parenthood does is abortions. I'm dying right now
"Alliance Defending Freedom" ahahahaha what bullshit.
I had an abortion--it wasn't bad. I would have done it myself if Planned Parenthood did not exist just go on the internet
excellent! and aside from the horrific activities that go on behind closed doors in all those clinics., the fact remains that ALL taxpayers are paying for abortions.
What proof do you have of any of these allegations?
I don't hear any evidence against PP here. Just a lot of inflammatory language thrown into a basic description of the ways Congress has perverted the policy-making process by enabling a billion dollar lobbying industry.
More like Planned Parent in-the-hood
Abortion isn't the only thing planned parenthood does
if they are as good as you say then donations will keep them serving
....so the argument here is that, basically, if women's health costs a lot of money, it is evil.  That is the argument. That if women's health is expensive, the people who provide for women's health are monsters.
There is no proof of anything she said, ignorant cunt
Lol Freendom to take away peoples' freedom, yeah!
Mass murder for millions, sounds like the US government.
Wow this bitch is a fucking retard. All you did was describe how a corporation works, which is common knowledge. Go get an abortion, whore.
Oh look. A bullshit video with someone whining about planned parenthood abortions and spreading lies. Cool.
just read thru the comments here... surprise mee that so many peeps comments disregard the murdered babies aspect. If a zygote gets terminated - not so bad   IMHO ... but the late term stuff "Ahhhhh! horrible..."
give me a "like", and I'll give you a like;)
If these videos aren't perfect examples of libel or slander...then nothing is.
You know 3% of what they do is abortions the other 97% is other women's health....you guys are fucking idiots. Defunding pp wont stop abortions because other doctors can easily do an abortion. Dumbasses damn
I bought a boat load of baby organs from PP and made a great smoothie.  Mmmm.
Is it Planned Parenthood or is it Planned Murderhood?! It's time to vote the Demoncrats out of Washington!
All these comments are against this info presented but none offering counter info to debunk it... pointlessness
Planned Parenthood also caught selling baby fetuses this year...
Heh, abortion mega-center. Do they put the abortion mega-centers next to the contraception emporiums? And where are the cancer screening complexs located?
Its hard to believe everything you see on the internet. Wow exposed  now and its been going on for long time??  Get rid of those employees . Planned parent helps millons of patients.

ONE TIME I FOUND A PIECE  OF GINGERBREAD SHAPED LIKE A PISTOL
Barbara probably thinks its a mirror

Okay, cutest GMM ever and one of my favorites for sure!!!!!  How random and awesome is that?!

I'm not trying to be a hater, but who names a dog Barbara?
Difference between dog lover and dog obsession
I have a multipoo. When we got another dog who is three times the size of her, the multipoo actually scares the big dog!
Are you AlRHETT???    You get the pun???
the puppies should featured at the Jimmy Fallon show at the Pup Quiz segment.   :o
Anyone else here the f word at 7:45?
If Link could be even cooler. He wears an Undertaker and Paul Bearer shirt.

Oooh Rhetts wife
Didn't expect his beard to be that huge hahaha
Mind blown! You guys have families?!

Fun fact, coke was invented before the invention of refrigeration while Pepsi was invented after the invention of refrigeration. Hence coke is meant to be drank warm while Pepsi is meant to be drank cold.

He has a chocolate clone-a-willy on his fucking desk. Don't ask me how I identified that so easily.

The hypocrisy in dancehall. I definitely agree with her. If the man wants a woman to go down on him, he must be willing to do the same. That is all she is saying.

don't watch this movie it is fake story,
Bajrangi in as 'Salman Khan' tone.. this movie is going to be blockbuster hit.. becoz 'sallu bhai' ka naam hi kaafi              hai
OMFG WHY THIS SHIT IS 1 S IN TRENDING? OMFG REMOVE THIS SHIT!
why are people liking this video?? afterall, we all know this is rubbish!  if they wanted to make a movie like this, they wouldn't have taken Hanuman as a character; someone whom we worship!
From now my favorite anime.
0:18 Allah! XD
What the fuck is this? Making jokes about Lord Hanuman? How could they?
guys take it easy. there's no offence to Hindu gods this movie. it's kind of giving knowledge to the younger generation about Hinduism
Happy to see salman khan as God...
In hollywood they make animation movies which both adults and kids enjoy but this is just slapstick comedy which is cringy and unfunny.
w to 8olll..

did he even get fully nude
dude that was savage
Hi Ryan, we are interested in using your video. Can you please email (viralfeedvideonetwork@gmail.com) to discuss the usage and your compensation
Don't ever shoot vertical video again.
What other poor casting choices do you think should've made the list?
Any role given to Ewan "I can't act" McGregor.
I know people doing research right now who predominantly wear tank tops and small shorts while doing said research. What's she supposed to walk around in a lab coat out there?
ok, i think johnny depp is doing just fine
I've gone out of my way to dislike every video Watch Mojo has ever posted. Now it's your guy's turn.
everytime i see paris "jackson"... half white/half black person with those non-hazel eyes...
so it's ok for Johnny depp to pretend to be English and put on a fake English accent but not Indian. interesting.
watching dracula, I expected Reeves to say no way or awe dude.
Why is Hayden on this list? Are you crazy? I'm a Star Wars fan, I've put money into this franchise, I wouldn't put him in this list.
Too bad that version of Batman didn't kill the franchise
6:45 I didn't know Ellen Degeneres was in the reboot of "Psycho".
1:48 Wait...What?!? THAT'S Michael Jackson's daughter?!? Holy shit she's hot! And very, very white...
Depp was the only saving grace of the movie.
stfu Looper. Depp did good even with an awful script!
Johnny Depp in Black Mass was outstanding though...
micheal jackson drugged and raped little boys? why do you still talk about him pooper?
So we all just gon ignore that blasian they casted to play Aaliyah in that shit lifetime movie
Michael Jackson started out black and ended up white. So it was a fair casting decision, and yes everything is racist looper. Won't watch again.
How many depictions of Tonto in any media used genuine American Indian performers?
basically, these films are bad because white actors lol
wasnt Jonny Depp part native american?
wait but johnny depp is actually part native american......
The problem with Batman and Robin wasnt George Clooney. No one couldve saved that film lol
Even just picking an equally bad actor that simply had the same accent as James Earl Jones would have worked better
Pathetic channel
Johnny Depp in everything after Donnie Brasco.
So George Clooney was surrounded by a full cast of bad acting in Batman? Isn't that a clear indication of bad directing rather than casting?
Nomber 0: Kylo " baby androgynous face " Ren - Adam Driver. Cant be possible hes the son of Leia and Han.
Why is Johnny Depp's face painted white in every single movie he is in?
Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin in Daredevil Johnny Storm as a black man(dont know his name)in the most recent Fantastic 4. Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury
I loved Depp in that movie.
OMFG... that Michael Jackson makeup is terrifying lol
Cameron Diaz in The Counselor is one of the worst I've ever seen
unsubbed bye
are you kidding me what made me mad is that the fire nation was all Indian... who the fuckare scared of indian people!? they are like the nices people I ever met eveing if they seem mad they still seem happy!!!
Vince Vaughan was good in Psycho.
I really liked the Lone Ranger...
I enjoyed looper before they got on the "white washing" bull shit band wagon.
i thought Disney would have learnt its lesson by now song of the south
Ghost in the shell was a good movie
I would like to take my view back.
Just blatantly racist.
Rotten tomatoes is a completely inconsistent site when it comes to scores of bad and good movie.
9:35 how did Aang's hand not explode?
This video summed up in one phrase "Ruh Roh, Whiiiiiiiiiitewassssshiiiiiiiing!" Fuck off.
So half of it is people being offended. Got it.
am i the only one who thinks hayden christiansins performence in episode 3 wasnt too bad it wasnt good by anymeens but it was barely passable for me but his episode 2 performance was well horseshit
This programm is a fucking joke of fucking idiot...
How is Paris Jackson the whitest person ever when her father is black? wat?
Why Viola Davis wasn't cast as Nina Simone in Nina is something I have never understood. She would have been exceptional.
Ummm  casting a WHITE actor as a "native american" ??? Johnny Depp isn't 100% caucasian, in FACT he's partly native american ... people are dumb.
Hayden wasnt miscast, Lucas messed the prequals.
1:06 Racist undertones for taking the piss out of an native indian, but he plays a drunken english pirate in make up and that's OK - this media is full of hypocrisy victims and divide.....
I'm offended by this list as it hurts my feelings.
9:59 sry, "asian descent"? Inuits aren't asian...
'Saldana is of Dominican and Puerto Rican Heritage"  Even if she doesn't identify herself as being Black there was nothing wrong with the way she looked as Nina Simone. She definitely has African roots.
Anyone is a better Batman than Afflack. Now that is someone that killed a couple superhero franchises.  Hollywood does need to stop "white washing".
Thank you, Looper for calling out Hollywood on their whitewashing!
I feel like i can tell by the trailers when a movie will flop.. hollywood needs a genius to show them something new!
I blame bad writing for Hayden's performance.
"Alexander shouldn't have an Irish accent" Nor should other historical characters have American accents, when the characters are people that were alive BEFORE America was discovered.
Miscast? Imagine being handed the script from these directors? The actors were the least of the problems of the films on this list.
Keanu when does he look or act like anything more than Bill and Ted's. What a complete loon.
I came here to express how unimpressed I was with your commentary but it looks like the internet already took care of that for me. Thanks internet. <3
Let's be honest though, Anakin/Hayden Christiansen was given a lot of terrible lines.
Avatar was already so american I dont even blame them for the casting, it just didnt even desserve a live actin movie tbh, mediocre concept, the anime was only good because it was unique and an American anime
I think it written in some legal forms from Jackson when he was alive that he would only allow white actors to portray him in films or TV.
I'm guessing no one from Looper actually saw Ghost in the Shell...
No no no, Kristen Stewart as snow white was the worst casting I've personally ever witnessed. And this white washing argument is bull shit.
Did just ''Black Faced'' Zoe Saldana !? ... wow !
I loved ghost in the shell what was wrong with it?
LOL now everyone going to want to see that episode about Michael Jackson  EVEN more QUICK SCAVENGE THE NET!
Who gives a shit if people are offended? Either watch the movie or don't ...
Actor is gender neutral. Actress is a completely useless word.
I love him!
pure love and positivity from nick cannon😍😍😍
I want to smell him
Even before this interview I thought Mariah lost a good man, Nick and her should tried to make it work...maybe things weren't perfect but after watching Mariah's  reality show that's what I felt.

He seems like a good person.
The best co-host! I gained so much respect for him!
4:12 "It's that love frequency we speaking about" ... 4:19 "Has Mariah ever met her? Nick: "No."  'Love frequency' my a*s 😂😂
Wow Nick Cannon is such a gentleman. I wonder which one of them didn't want to grow in the marriage. I really liked these two together and I hope they get back together soon.
Hahahahah omg but seriously nicki doesn't seem like she would be his type lol I don't feel like nicki is anyone's type tbh lol
Omg he is so funny he reminds me if my ex boyfriend. he funny and got lots of respect for women love Nick. I hope him and Maria do get back but he must be such a great dad. Maybe he couldnt handle Marias Diva ways lol
The man looks like a fool in that turban. Stop the attention-seeking stunts!
the way i am smiling and blushing here along with Nick😂😂 as if I am the one being interviewed😂😂😂 haha you can tell Nick still loves her❤❤
Hats off to Nick for his love frequency, positivity and truth.
Wait a minute... When did Niki Booty DROP??!
That's probably Wendy's biggest dream coming true: he confirmed the Fantasy at the hospital story AND answered it all about Mariah hahahahahaha
Bobby brown vibes
Nick is a confused , immature male. Bye, and take off the turban .
there is no reason for Mariah to get back with Nick, actually no exes should never get back together, once it's over it's over. I've had great loves and I've moved on.
He's aged a lot.
i really love how he speaks so highly of Mariah
if they get back together...I'm gone be like damn wendy
he ain't right he came for nicki minaj wow lol
He does go for more regular kind of women that's why I was confused about Mariah and him
I lost my only child to lupus at the age of 21; happy Nick is living with this autoimmune disease
He said after the booty dropped!? 😂😂😂
Nick is so much funnier. I wanna c him more
Wendy Williams... You are a sad person. Obviously you are so obsessed with Mariah...
this niah said BUBBLY BOOTY  NICKI!!!!!!! LOL

Make sure you don't burn yourself out man, best of luck to you!
Can I be on your show?
Congratulations!!!! It is a big step but it is better to be independent!!
It's just the most awesome thing I've wanted, like Christmas but for heathens.
Dude DO NOT try to do this 24/7! YOU WILL BURN OUT! and then it's all down hill from there.
So is this the end of this channel?
youtalktoofastslowdownalittlebitwehavetimetohearyouout
Congrats and good luck!!
when is he posting again?
You are such a joke. Begging for donations, pathetic if you can't afford it tough shit. Independent funding so you aren't in debt and payout dividends youreally some work of bs
you go phill, I will donate when I can.  Congratulations on this bold endeavour. if anyone can do it you can man. I haven't been watching you for very long but you are now a staple source for me.  keep up the good work
I was in Cuba on vacation and had a dream where I went to your house and we just talked about world issues..... THEN WE FUCKED ... j/k we just talked. haha  Also excited for the changes coming!
Let's see the dollar amount sir. Why is that hidden? Not very transparent.
phew I thought he was going to come out gay
isn't this what sourcefed was intended to be when it launched? i guess that did have strings attached as it wasn't funded by yourself
So he's not gay...?
so when can we expect the show to be back
cool story bro
YESSSSS YOU GO DEFRANCO
He is going to get shot.
I was getting very upset he didn't upload today so I came back here to see if I missed something.. sure enough I did.. see you next week phil!
phil sorry.. my credit card is a no go.. go thru all that and paranoia strikes...  drunk again.. what 12 beer.. where do you want the money order sir
Seriously, does this guy every TAKE A BREATH?  Is he on crack or did he just drink a dozen triple lattes?
Lmao defranco elite is starting up because "YOUTUBE IS SHUTTING DOWN MY CHANNEL" for the third time
With that kind of tone and music you sound like you're about to copyright news channels
I'd watch more of these, but cannot stand the DIARRHEA OF THE MOUTH SYNDROME this guy suffers from.  The editing so that there are no commas or periods during the diatribe, etc., etc.
Sub or bad luck !
Keep up the good work!!!
honorary monthly mention for hubble.. donation secured.

Philly D. Great news, this is the right decision and I have zero doubts that you will end up in the right place in the end. I would recommend reaching out to Colin Moriarty, if anyone knows news and truth, its him
There are so many people I wish I could support through Patreon.  However this is the first time I felt it was necessary.
On a real note Phil, can I come work for your news Network? I support your vision!

You are a light in the dark phil

We used to a have a pretty cool news channel on youtube. What was it called? Sourcefeeder or something like that? I wonder what happened to it, Phil.

Now I feel bad for not keeping up with the Phili as much as I should.
Another left wing newspaper, just great.

Stop asking poor people for  money you bitch.
So happy and excited for this! <3
Omg that Looks awesome !
that's it! where is the action
This looks so real wow !
Is this a boat ride or a trackless ride?
AWESOME! . . . now add a drop off a floating mountain and we in business!!!
The animatronic was amazing, but is there a point to this ride? Story? Or do you just float down the river?
Is there any kind of drop or hill? Any reason why there is not a wheelchair boat on this ride?
can I do this in vr 360? that'll be awesome
Only 4 weeks to go!!! 😃😃😃
OMG This animatronic in the last shot looks like a real person   AMAZING
OH MY GOSH IM GOING TO DISNEY WORLD NEXT MONTH AND I AM SO EXCITED TO SEE THAT
Looks amazing
Very beautiful and stunning!
Those are some of the most impressive animatronic movements I've ever seen!
Looks amazing!
So even the Dark Tower has been poz'd. :-(
reported, nice wh
Am I the only one that got excited that they put in a Pennywise amusement park in the trailer and a shot of the Overlook Hotel? Stephen King easter eggs
WoW this looks fucking awesome
he who does not thumbs up this comment, has forgotten the face of his father.
The soundtrack with the chiming is way too similar to the one in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly by Ennio Morricone especially the last segment called the Duel.
i bet that new york sky opens up and everything gets sucked up at some point near the end like every other blockbuster now days...
Top 10 anime battles
matt and idris are very good actors and stephen king is maybe the best writer of this time sooo.....what could be wrong with this movie?
Still waiting for Viggo Mortensen as Roland
I am highly disappointed. Stephen King is a sell out, it should have been  4 or more movies. and followed the books more.
Go Then, There are other worlds than these
Why isn't idris British he has the best British voice ever
the dark tower wall hacking
There's is no gunslinger
is this like the book? cuz it looks like hollywood made his move changing things to make more money
Looks nothing like the book......
hellz yeah!!!! Idris and Matthew going at it!
"I see a tower, a man in black, and a man who IS black"   xD
I do not setup my next rape with my eye i set it up with my mind... i do not rape with my cock i rape with my body
Im so fucking hype for this. GET HYPE YAH FUCKS.
I only pressed this because i saw Idris Elba
THIS IS NOT ROLAND. THIS IS NOT JAKE. AND IT'S NOT THE DARK TOWER. WTF HAVE THEY DONE TO IT. I'm refusing to believe Stephen King could be ok with this crap.
I don't see any pictures of him carrying the double-amputee woman around.
Wait..Idris is not the men in black?
LAST ACTION HERO!
Hey that's the tune from "For a Few Dollars More"
Reported. He is using an aimbot
Aahhh so the leader of the dawn guard uses guns now
no Sheemie, no Maerlyns grapefruit, still stoked to see the Good Man John Farson
Actually looks pretty decent,
IS THAT IDRIS?!! black british actors pull upp!!
subscribe to me and I will subscribe back to you with my 5 accounts
The darkness is strong here, no top comments lol.
So can his heart shoot a gun?
1:30 Did anyone notice how the sign reads "Pennywise"
NO TOP COMMENTS??

Blackwashing.

oh yeah? well https://www.facebook.com/capcitycomedyclub/videos/10154575245363683/?hc_location=ufi
Idris Elba can play these kind of maniac killing machine characters like no one else
I read the Dark Tower in the 90s, i dont remember anything in the trailer from the book.  Did they change it?  :(
I expected some modifications from the book; but this is a complete rewrite.   They may as well have just given it a different name.
Even if its mostly only a film inspired by the Dark Tower series, I'm unshakably glad this is happening.
Fucking hell that last shot was pretty fucking sick
I wish they gave Idris, Roland's Bombardier Blue eyes for the movie. But other than that, I don't mind this at all!
LMAO they got the roles mixed up.  Idris Elba would make a better BAD GUY and Matthew  a good guy imho.
Another case of blackwashing a character.
you are going to love earth lmao
THIS LOOKS SO FREAKIN SICKKK!!!
did the kid have an american or british accent? i couldn't tell XD
the black bond!
0:45-1:00 is that the vertu ringtone ??
gonna be awesome movie
this kids acting is BAAAADDDDD
Idris Elba is also a Dark Tower with 1.9 m.
*points gun* "Who're you?" my name jeff
Omg I'm crying. Filmmakers just f***ed up the book. How could Stephen King  allow this?

if u are not tyler perry or oprah not getting any $
Mess with Idris and he will give you the #DarkTower
I'll be honest, I was confused when I first heard Roland was going to be black in the movies, since Him being white lead to a pretty funny conversation in the books. But Idris does do a great job in the trailer!
wish u all the luck wit this.they want it for free. hope u get ur money back.
For those complaining about idris elba let me ask you a question, if ghost in the shell is whitewashing is the dark tower blackwashing? Yes that's right the answer is your racist
I gotta say the movie seems pretty awesome but this trailer is whack
Dear sony...if you could lay off product placement in times square that be great...
lmao my real name is idris and all these comments saying we love idris make me laugh
these vibes are making me to feel very strange.Can´t explain that but  I really like this song. Good job Kygo and Selena. Hi from Slovakia
Am I the only one who thinks this is messed up
I have a problem. whenever I look at the comments in a YT song, I never see comments related to the song😳😢
This song is amazing, we did a Rock Version of it on our channel if anyone wants to check it out :)
Sometimes I want that the writer will explain his song even thought I think I got it cause there are so many explanations but the song is amazing
The best clip I ve ever seen!
this video reminds me of Arash- Pure love, it's the same concept
superb music Selena rocks
*when you see a butterfly in a closed space like you house or rooms it's meant to be a close spirit but I'm reading some of the comment about the girl and I don't wanna believe them (I'm not btw)*
This song is something to be proud of like it's so good the beat lyrics and visuals just so good,glad it was Selena who was singing this, perfect voice for it
hun and I listened to this at the same time  ...sweet
is it me or does that guy looks like Logan paul
2:15 If she's dead and just hovering around him as a ghost, who's she talking to on her phone? Is that a GHOST PHONE?! When she sits down on the bed THE WEIGHT SHIFTS. She's not dead.
Bow Bow bowery, Bow Bow whiskey neat  Grateful I'm so...grateful I... It ain't me !
lol was sucht logan paul hier?
i don't understand the story. And I was looking at the audio version,it has so many views. Maybe because this video is lame. I miss Selena. And again can somebody explain what this is about?😫😞
I LOVE Georgia fowler!! So happy she's in this
it ain't me :)
very very good
MY FAVOURITE SONG!!!
RONALDO IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD!!!!
she look like Scarlett Johansson
i picture something like a girl moving on from a bad relationship and looking back to the guy's choices and asked where he is going in life.
Hey the MRI scan turned to a party club......but the song was superb...loved it...
who's here before 20mil?
Me as a doctor
is it just me or Selina sounds like Taylor swift 🤣
Depth in the Video👌
in this video there isn´t selena gomez, is there?
never knew this songs video would have a meaning so powerful... it almost made me cry...
Ok seriously i want him to collaborate with Ariana grande
This song reminds me of 13 Reasons Why.. Fuck, this show haunts me !!
GEORGIA FOWLER!!!!
lmfao she was right when she said "it aint me" because it in her in this video!!! youtube "Daddy mikey - street wars"
i'm here for georgia
if the girl at the beginning was the boy's girlfriend, selena is who?
He reminds of newt Scamander for some reason
I expected selena here
Im not saying that the Music video is bad only that it came to late 😟
The girl is gorgeous!
I'm crying ;(
Why is it that I feel like I have heard this song before its release
can someone give me the lyrics
love this song so much!😃
it make me sad😭
Selena Gomes
this song make me cry😭😖
Another meaning for this MV :   The one company with JB, It ain't Selena
I love this song! Check out the video Abbey and I posted!!
it's such a beautiful song. check out my new self-written song on my channel and dedicate it to someone you love.
I had thought that selena will sgain show off her body or romance and she will be in the vid. but the video so meaningful and beautiful.
I expected that Selena Gomez would appear in the official video. It's so hard to expect. But the song is great.
I don't understand the meaning of this video nor the meaning of the song itself.
Celebrating life even in the darkest moments.      Viva love ❤️
I want an instrumental version of this song! ♡
Excellent electronic music.
This documentary makes the album that more REAL!
Thank you for everything J.cole.
"Maybe the hood needs a new faith... A new story about a boy not too far from where you stay" -- Jermaine Cole
I wish everyone could watch this
This documentary made me appreciate the album even more.....
can someone tell me the songs names in order please?
I respect this man. Lyrically and mentally gifted.
Great Documentary J. Cole
Songs at 1:51 7:45 12:50 18:42 23:50 25:46 31:55 40:51  No disrespect to the film
I cried at the end
G.O.A.T...REVOLUTION
this made the album so much better
J cole fans are so real. I can't wait for the Dallas concert.
This shit got me crying bruh
What camera is he using at the start?
The song "tears for ODB" means so much more now..
for your eyez do you understand  for your eyez do you understand, me?
What type of camera was j cole recording with ?
This is just amazing and extremely touching
Am i the only one who clapped for like 5 mins at the end of the film?
JCole & Kendrick Lamar are the Future for Hip Hop!
can someone list em tracks for a nigga haahaa I'm more of a kdot nigga but life without j cole is like  suge knight widout Pac. aint shit.
the hurricane down here in nc was terrible
Props to jcole for this
I need this video in my life
J. cole should have be more popular than he is right now. Bicause he is the real rapper. He is not like others who do it only for money, bitches or fame. The world need more rappers like him.
can somebody get the music vids of the songs? we need em all
Simple... Jesus is the answer.
Thank You for this. It was fantastic, thank you.
his by far the one rapper who doesnt hype up an album. makes lyrics come alive. true passionate story teller
J.Cole speaks nothing but the truth ❤
Lady at the end's story was devastating ☹️.  Gotta keep moving.
Wake up America
Anyone know the song at 8:00 ?
I don't care. Jcole isn't main stream he's just too good
We need more artist to stand for something like Cole
Im so fucking confused why would they turn the cameras away after the raid is that part of the procedure?
43:08 very deep 😕
Man Michael Brown's cousin was so real and genuine. Crazy how they just met like that. God works in mysterious ways.
How can someone dislike this? J Cole is too real man, I cant even with this brother.. thanks J.
this just made me love 4 your eyez only that much more.  why can't we have more artists like J cole. speak real shit, open your eyes to see the bigger picture and love life.
This was strong. Realest shit I've seen on YouTube yet. I love how J Cole is so in touch with where he came from, and the people that reside in it.
don't retire! please!  this is beautiful like the music you make!👏❤
Man, I love this! Love J. Cole for this!
Thank you so so so so fucking much J Cole you're the realist all this rappers need to learn from you...  You're this generation's Bob Marley
Beautiful work as always
J.cole is a Living Legend. 🙏
And whoever disliked this is really a aashole.
Anyone who sees wrong in the message that J Cole writes n rap about are in denial n live in a fantasy /idealistic world. You cannot make a change or be a better person if you are not realistic. Cole World foreva !!♥👌🎶
There is always deeper meaning to Coles music. Being black in this America is difficult and depressing. We need to be woke and see all the wrong happening.
Song at 7:45 is amazing
Please eat Plants not animals. Please spread kindness and compassion. Also please look up and watch Earthlings documentary on youtube.
this was amazing cole
Real touching music.
Cole World = Real World
One word, Powerful
I love this documentary, sad moments too. The lady at the end was so inspirational
This was so beautiful
All the dislikers are slim jesus fans
Damn this is the best documentary I've seen in years and brings the album to life in a different perspective.
that last chick on the bike made a hardcore dude like me tear up
Great watch. Makes an already great album feel like so much more.
I gotta meet this man one day!!

Cole I have to meet you. This is the realest shit ive ever seen. Thank you.
Shiiit! Am a real niccur but that lady at the end made me cry, straight up..
when you can't record separate videos for each song
This was so beautiful. 🙏
J cole always be looking confused af
how can people even thumbs down the video man this shit too real
I haven't seen a comment yet on how his track "Neighbors" was really legit. They really thought my mans was selling dope lol
Cole is the man for this one
Mix Martial Arts is a far superior form fighting than Boxing.  The limitations Floyd would have against Connor in a street fight would be embarrassing.
who the fuck cares what this idiot says, st8 up fucking loser
Very Honest interview. Good job Floyd!
Floyd awesome
He has some solid points. Boxing is money. Mma is not king in current day. However in having a black belt in bjj and many years of boxing, Flloyd would be a fish out of water on the ground. Little effort.
deceptive title
Floyd aint a fighter or a boxer, hes a dancer 😂
What a idiot. Dude, Connor is stepping out of his comfort zone to play your game. Step into a MMA fight with him and see what happens. You only want the money, Connor is there for the challenge and the money.
history's most diplomatic answer that came from a boxer
What's money got to do with fighting you daft prick
What an ignorant ass bunch of paparazzi
Mayweather cannot even promote the fight and talk about Connor's chances with a straight face.
Floyd is honest with it, but I think he trollin the reporter.
Connors only chance would be if  money may makes a mistake and he knocks out mayweather, but I don't see that happening.
it's not about the money it's about the sport and spiritualism and about being a warrior he's not a true warrior just a coward.
Do your home work! Floyd never did any homework because he never went to school.
Mayweather doesn't wanna fuck with a southpaw, because Zab Judah was the only fighter to drop him (although the ref missed the call).
But has TMZ made $300 million? Probably. Fucking parasites.
Just fight McGregor give us wat we want !
Floyd is very respectful. I don't get why he gets so much shit. Sure, he's smacked around a few women. I'd love to get smacked around by Floyd
Mayweather was on his kindergarten  track team.
All of a sudden he considers Conor a fighter smh
In a MMA Fight when Conor McTapout tries to takedown Floyd he would already take a Uppercut what get him sleep while trying to takedown Floyd. Floyd would destory ConorMcTapout in Boxing and MMA.
boxers are good but in a real fight any mma fighter will knock the fuck out of any of these boxers
I don't care what ANYBODY says. Floyd is NOT a fighter, just a boxer. too many rules and regulations in boxing. which makes for less styles to prepare for. FIGHTING is WAY harder. so many more styles for fighting.
Now Floyd is talking up Mcgregors chances you know this fight will happen. This man owns his own promotion company. Clever salesman.
I dont want to see this fight. Saddens me to see a legend of the Sweet Science ready to fight someone from MMA.
MMA is much younger, also UFC pays their fighters MUCH less.
ufc wont allow a fighter to make that much
Boooooooooooooooring fight already.
Mayweather is known to be a notorious trash talker yet he's entertaining the thought that McGreggor can win, hmmm... I think he's scared
the title should have been named "mayweather bows down to honor mcgregor"
it's not about how much money you make. It is also not about the sport. It is about who can beat who up.
Maywether at his wedding :   Priest : Do you take this woman as you're lawfully wedded wife ?   Floyd : I made $300 million in one night
The managers are the real winners here.
Boxing has been around as a professional sport way longer that the UFC so yeah there's legends but as mma starts aging legends will rise and over shadow boxing. Boxing is just one component of mma.
Boxers make millions. MMA fighters make peanuts,attribute that directly to dana! He wants someone else to pay conor the big money and they "Need" Floyd to help them do that. dana should go back to carrying Floyds bags!
He said Conor the 2nd biggest name in MMA Who 1st?????
yea boxing is not better.  ufc is way better
Is that Yoel Romero talking in the back?
Mma fighters should be paid more then boxers.  That have it a lot harder.
Imma mma fan and my fav fighter is Silvia... much respect for mayweather in this interview in keeping it factual and respecting mma
most sense ive seen him talk. even though im an mma fan hes talking truth connor wants those numbers . not my kinda guy butt smart business brain he knows how to crunch numbers.
Floyd is obviously trolling LMAO hahahaha
You think you can beat conor? - no but i made 300 m in 1 night
Martial arts have nothing to do with your bold head
People need to stop hating on Floyd.
Bitch ass Nigguh'....shutch' yo' ass up. you know you ain'r gone' tuh' fight him Puto. #StreetFights #MMA #UFC #FUH LIFE WICKED WEBB CHAPEL EXT. 214!!!!O
MMA is still a new sport compared to boxing lmao
MMA is real fighting mother fucker boxing is one aspect of fighting . Fuck boxing I watched the Mayweather vs Pacquiao fight and I have seen more entertaining fights on the ultimate fighter
Floyd is such a douche bag
Damn Floyd let me hold one of those necklaces
It's only gonna be one round if Floyd loses.
If they were to fight, would it MMA-rules or boxing rules?
second biggest name who's the first.
Respect to Mayweather✊✊
Everyone forgetting, McGregor asked for this...
its time to pass the torch. come on john cena leave wwe lol pass on the torch to someone who's a torch 🤔😂.
yeah but conor makes more than anyone like a million. conor makes millions for a fight.
i feel like floyd is breaking
How many times does he have to repeat that he made $300 million in one night... I hate him more everytime
Lota dick ryders in this video
I know one thing floyd gonna make  1 billion for this fight.
he's talking out his ass, he does a good job of dancing around the truth; he's scared of Connor
Floyd beat this overhyped Neanderthal then go home and count those zeros the ones at the end of your record and checks!!
OK Floyd we know you have peas spread some around to us poor folk... dollar bills don't make the man... but it would be nice Floyd give me a loan.
You gotta understand to never underestimate your opponent, that's why Floyd said what he did he's not dumb
Just know that if Conor  and Floyd were to fight with no rules, Conor would have him unconscious in 1 minute.
2nd biggest name in MMA?? Bitch please McGregor is the biggest name in all contact sports so suck a dick bitch
Them Diamond's 😍
Floyd is all talk it ain't bout how much you you can make in a night bruh it's if you have balls as a men to fight .. its bout how much after the fight ... come on Wana see the fight asap .... 😂😂😂😂😂
M hearing excuses already
conor has 0% chance. I've seen a boxer vs mma fighter in a boxing match. Both top(!) ranked fighters. mma guy had 0% chance.
Floyd knows Conor has no chance of beating him, he's just saying this to build up Conor so that more people will tune in to see the fight which leads to more money in Floyd's pockets.
Sly dig at Connor the second biggest name in the mma ? Who's first lol
49 - 1 #fact
beautiful gems
"Floyd how would you describe Connor as a fighter".                                                          Floyd: i made 300 million in one night
yeah they don't make as much money but they are superior athletes compared to boxing
😅not sugar Shane Mosley ?
I wouldn't pay to watch his boring fights. Mayweather would defeat McCregor by decision no TKO or KO.
"He is not a boxer though" The fucking retards that think MMA guys don't train boxing should be lined up and shot. Dumb fucks. Boxing is a portion of MMA. You're going to find this out the hard way.
heres the deal. in boxing ring boxer wins, in mma the mma fighter usually wins. floyd will destroy colin in boxing ring. wont last one round.
What a complete and utter retard.
Imagine if you were her kid in the passenger seat and had to endure that long line of shame.
No no no, do not let her in. The behavior must be corrected.
Bless the person who let them in
Drunk?, or just plain stupid? Some people should not be allowed to drive. Now I know who's been causing all of the traffic jams on the interstate, I-4 in Florida! Anybody get the license tag number?
I liked the song played from a radio! What song?
I hope they went home and blew their brains out in front of their kids.
In those final seconds you should have cut her off and made her back even more LOL
She doesn't even know how to back up lol
Money says she had her phone in her hand..........
"Oh no, I fucked up! I better kerb my wheels too while I'm at it!"
This is worse than the video of Mark Diesel trying to back a truck up. smhid
Boos for the nice guy. Never help such a douche :)
Her reverse looks like blind man in a wheelchair in middle of highway.
driving was bad no question there, very stupid.   but i find strange and almost sad at how desensitised these guys seemed to the car radio commercials...
Which place is this that the cars doesn't have a license plate?
Shame, shame, shame!
It's a pity you couldn't get her license plate number! Which state do you live in, that's too damned CHEAP to issue TWO license plates per vehicle?
She has never used reverse on a car.
#MakeDMVsGreathAgain!  #MDGA
Wow the guy filming was extremely patient....major kudos...I would've been raging.
Lol I got an ad about California traffic tickets before the video
had to be a woman driver...... driver is showing narcissistic type behavior right here
Well, it seems Honda drivers are assholes worldwide, not only in my country
She needs practice reversing and obeying laws.
WHAT. An. Ass.
free advertisement for king and king attorneys, the atlanta braves and 1-800-411-PAIN.....
This woman was having stroke and trying to get to the hospital. www.cnn.com/hskjhhg47hf74fhf874ff7f3
Make sure you have a backup plan when doing something like that...
I wouldn't have let him in. Get to the back of the line Bruh.
awful radio
that is just a regular Monday after work in my country...
This is a CHINESE DRIVER. I don't mean to sound racist. This is the Chinese driving method transplanted onto Western terrain.
This is sad I'm 14 and I could do that with a pickup truck much less A CAR!
What kind of dashcam do you have that recorded this?
Shame Shame Shame! (What we do in the shadows scene) :P
When I took my license test about 10 years ago in California, reversing in a straight line was a requirement.
she is good at forward as she is reverse
I'm 16 and I can back up better than this idiot.
Pity someone let her in the queue. I'd love to see her backing up all the way to the end of the queue.
That woman is retarded show how people dont care
The sketchiest part of this video is that car ain't got no number plate and the driver looks nervous and worried
She scraped the fuck out of her wheels. This was so cringeworthy to watch
damm how can you suck ao bad at driving , reminds me of my dad. i get high blood pressure driving with him
And did they even make way for the bastard? I would not do that...
This is why it's NYC have the law to have both front & back plates at all times. We know there's very bad driver out there
probably a tRump voter!
where was it? Turkey?
that's an empowered feminist
that person sucked at backing up so bad xD
All those other cars don't let her in, they're as evil as you!
I feel like people are really overlooking the true hero here and that's the person who finally made room to let queeny get the fuck out of the way.
I don't know what's worse, cutting the line or that reverse.
Hahaha haha I was waiting for someone out of pity to let her in
Stupid Acura let them in. Fuck that.
How bad are you at driving that you can't even reverse in a proper straight line? How'd she get her license in the first place?
You're a better man than I am for staying so calm.
LMAO I stay right there in Lindbergh
That car that let her in, honking as she gets in front, had me in tears lol
I was partially expecting her to just slam head-on into the driver and wail on her horn for like 20 minutes straight.
How do you not know how to back up properly??
What a dumb bitch. And I just know it's a young girl
1-800-411-PAIN
of course it's a woman
doesn't know how to back up. Scarring the heck out of those wheels.
lol she's is horrible at reversing.  women drivers what are you going to do
You should have taken a shot of her license plate so she can get a ticket.
445246400.. I hope they're listening to the same station.
That is some really annoying radio ads you listen to
lol i wouldn't have let her in
so many fucking lawyer ads in the USA wtf
"cause a car swerved in your lane" XD
50: the guy in red car pulls dick move
What the fuck is that radio xD ? how can you listen to that?
probably a Syrian refugee
You deserve an award for patience  & not leaning on your horn or yelling through this ordeal like many ppl would have done.
Shouldn't be driving at all. There needs to be a culling of stupid people eventually. Of course the world needs grocery baggers and TSA agents, but there's no need for anyone this stupid.
Came here for some red and blue lights....disappointed  :(
Typical Atlanta....
I'm not saying that all bad drivers are woman.. that is definitely a woman in that car.
Thought she was actually trying to get up on the curb... nope.  This is pretty sad, haha.
and I thought cali traffic was bad
He just sounds really awkward...
This is such a great movie, give a chance, you might like it !
SO clearly they end up succeeding, clean, bright, together and happy at the end of the movie. GOT IT, thanks Netflix, now I'm spared watching it...
I didn't know payphones were still a thing
a love story about 20 something year old junky losers breaking the law. Netflix really knows how to attract the millennials
If these characters were brown this would they would be considered gang criminals lol.  Also manic pixie dream girl much?
this looks cute as hell
oh god. the fault in our stars or whatever millioneth movie is like this but in series form? is this a movie? i'm glad they cast average joe looking folks who look natural but the plot? c'mon. I liked the movie Go.
I know this is a basic romance movie, but I still liked it.
Looks funny
thats annatole from war and peace
is netflix the new straight to video?
i thought the girl was hannah baker in the thumbnail
Terrible Acting
Is it just me who cant make it through the first 30 seconds of the trailer?
PITTSBURGH WHATTTT?
i just watched this it was meh
this looks very uninteresting
she will be an A list actress I'm calling it right now.
cast attractive people >.>
I thought its was gonna be a  new season of "13 Reasons Why" called Tramps -_-
I genuinely thought that was the catch me outside girl
their problems are so white that it blinds my eyes
the girl looks like shailene woodley
wow netflix makes some subpar looking movies
that boy is beautiful!  and did they say Pittsburgh?  That's my hometown!
This movie looks cute
damn this girl is too pretty for this role
This would have been a good series.
That guy looks either 14 or 40.
fell asleep halfway through
It seems boring... Grace's acting also looks to suffocate the characters personality.. She needs far more acting experience...
It was a decent little romance movie. 7.5/10
Netflix is going to shit nowadays.
THIS MOVIE WAS SO PERFECT..i'm in love
I hate movies with bad actors and actresses. This looks like ass.
whats with netflix original movies why not warner bros lions gate originals fix pathe originals netflix should stay streamin company not a movie mogul warner bros is mogul
Mediocre. Don't waste your time on this.
$1500 to give someone a bag ... somehow manages to fuck that up. I can't handle THAT level of stupid.
If everything does not have to be a love story FOR ONCE!
I loved this movie!!! Congrats to everyone  involved, you've done a great job. Keep doing amazing things like this
finally after months of waiting this will be out today on netflix. from Adam leon (gimme the loot). don't miss it.
They look like brother and sister lol
WHERE IS LUKE CAGE?
How Bow Dat
What about you?
Yay, I can finally see her in role without having to hate her character due to pre existing bias =D!
You can't convince me this movie cost more than 200$ to make.
I like the music.
I think I would have preferred a serialized live action adaptation of Lady and The Tramp.
dumb and dumber but not funny.
cool, trailer showed me all the parts worth watching. now I don't have to watch it.
looks better than dear white people smh
So basically spend the whole movie looking for a bag , no thanks
pretty sure i just saw the whole series
Moustache? I thought that was a shadow.
0:51 Who is the actor on the right ? I don't remember
wow, this is a first.....couldn't even finish the trailer....soooo bad
renew the get down
Ha this looks like a short film made for a school project
Does anyone know the song at 1:38? It's so good!
i legit thought that was Cory when I first saw i was so shook
The music in this trailer makes it so disjointed and horrible
JUST GIVE ME 3% SEASON TWO FOR FUCKS SAKE
Can anyone just shit in a bucket, call it a script, and get it produced?
Talk about meh. mediocre premise. small scale execution. Looks like the actors are the only things bringing out the charm/heart of this. Good job casting. You're the real mvp.
The movie looks kinda cliche, and the trailer was just bad
Lol I saw the thumbnail and seriously thought it was the "cash me ousside" girl. Happy it's not though.
This title is very misleading... *Puts dick back in pants*
this was good until it got hetero
why is mike birbiglia in this
Na child I'll stick to 13 reasons why
I'll watch ANYTHING with Mark Birbiglia
a love story about a bad drugs deal.  originall :/
Don't want to see.
Is that the cash me outside girl?
this is doooodshit
They need a "Meh" button in between the like and dislike
alright, the whole plot was just spoiled in this trailer, I'm not gonna watch this TV series.
waiting waiting !!
Is that the CASH ME OUSSIDE GIRL??!!?
13 reasons is better
i was expecting some SLUTTY fuckin hoes! fuck
In the thumbnail I thought it was a young Robin Tunney 0.o
Did I just see "Metuchen" as a trainstop in this? I grew up there!!
She resembles Shailene Woodley

Every time is see these videos I know the MMA fighter is going to win but I always hope the monk in robes wins because it's always much more epic when they do :P
A disgraceful act.
try fighting yilong the fake shaolin he kicked many mma ass  or china sanda taichi youth
please note that groin attack, eye gouging and small joint manipulation are all ALLOWED in this fight.
Dude just pushed through like a tank causing the other dude to fall down.. and just like any other MMA fighters, they would fuck you up whilst laying down. it don't matter. Pussy bitch move being utilized in MMA.
this aint 1080p why u lying fam :(
where is donnie yen?
Your Tai Chi is weak old man.
i thought taichi is more of a morning exercise for old people
old boy thought he was Ip Man!
Taichi is useless bullshit in real  fight, it's only good in cheating money. Only Bruce Lee has real Kongfu.
Well that went actually how I thought it would ..
how about a combat trained shaolin monk vs professional mma fighter
all those kung fu movies i wasted my time watching
all this competitions are stupid. you can ask the same question: who's stronger? all animal predators combined or a lion?
This is so dumb, Taichi is a way to release slow motion energy, should the fight had been mma vs wing chun, it'd be different
Tai Chi Master : i shuld have use my Qi energy..XD
Roid Rage from a mile away
whats this bullshit?embarrassing
wtf is this HAHAHA really Tai Chi? Please challenge others who really know Tai Chi man~
there are thousands of martial arts, only 5-6 useful ones and all of them are used in MMA
Only a fucking idiot would think tai chi had any chance lol
That MMA guy is a douchebag. Yes, you defend yourself at all times and yes it's a fight. But the Tai Chi guy was totally unable to defend himself. Slapping the Tai Chi guy around would have achieved the same results.
The tai chi "master" said, "he fell because of shoes" his student have sent to challenge the mma guy and soon the round 2 will come.
What the fuck did you expect
"i'm one with the force the force is with me, i'm one with the force the force is with me", he forgot the magic words...
That taichi man must have watched too much Ip man stuff
crouchin opossum technique. lay down and play dead lol
the Tai Chi guy : "Heyyyy, he didn't fight in slow motion. This is not fair!"
where is master Wong?
im not a martial artist or studying any discipline,but i know the difference between real life and a movie. tsk
So basically Tai Chi Master lvl 3 vs MMA fighter lvl 100.
because dear Taichi master, in real life, the opponent will fight back:)) stop hitting those wooden sticks and start meeting people :)))
Is someone actually surprised by this result??
He used chi blast to drop that old man.(that or he was tripped by the invisible man). Then proceeded to sandwich his leg and throw a barrage of squishing sounds to his ears. Social security has never sounded so good!
Traditional Chinese Kungfu, Traditional Chinese medicine, Chinese fortune telling and Feng shui are China's national shames.
he just got a snot beat out of him for believing in tai chi LMAO
Would it make a difference if the Tai Chi Master abstain from sex?
After challenge this Yang taichi master, the mma guy in video challenged Chen taichi. The whole Chen taichi world now wants the guy silenced dammit! they are using all resources, except accepting the challenge!
this is fake the taichi is not a master    so slow n weak try fighting chinas yearly taichi shaolin sanda competition
Where's the tai chi? Where the master?The fraud is someone saying the guy was a master. He got hit in the face......yeh. He's a master....this is marketing material. Are the Russians involved?
Tai Chi ?let he try with wing chun :)
try master wong
because so many bastards call themself tai chi or kong fu master
If CHINESE KONGFU OR TAI CHI IS REAL and powerful,useful Why Chinese Army don"t learn it?    That's funny , right?? why the Chinese UFC MMA player don't use TAI CHI?? cause they know this is paper tiger
maybe if mma fighter did it in slowmo then master tai chi couldve chance in winning
I  am Chinese,Let  me tell you soming TAI CHI is fake,wushu is a kind of show, this is a huge economy chain in CHINA,just like WWE, It was arranged
nice Kung Fu skills. I think that technique was called the armadillo hides from hawk
That "master" has horrendous footwork. 
can't beleave my eyes....I wish that guy not relate to kung fu
pretty stupid trying to use individual skill to compare two totally different style & form of fighting abilities...
You're fighting a mixed martial artist...tsk tsk
that fake taichi master deserve this.
It looks like traditional martial art good for demonstration only....but fail in real fighting....
Bruce Lee has seen the limitations of traditional martial arts and therefore seek many other forms to improve himself and thus pave the way for MMA. Listen and learn from the Legend.
i didnt need to see this to know that tai chi is the weakest martial art ever hahahahaahah. great for old folks...bad for combat...well at least the tai chi they teach in my white safe neighborhood
the tai chi guy never fought in his fucking life
hhahahaahahahahahahaaa
now just un 10secs the century old tai chi has lost its value.
With the help of mma hitting you, tai chi meditation could go to the next level. if you know what i mean.
Taichi is 1% of martial art and it's for freaking elders, wtf
Eastern martial arts are the katanas of the fighting world. Overhyped, pricey and more ritualistic than effective
This is not only a fight between traditional and modern martial arts, but a also a competition between delusion and reality.
That guy is not a master, just a normal tai chi student. Next competition will be with real tai chi master in few weeks time. Who wins?
tai chi is a stupid martial arts!
it's not about what martial arts you used, it's about who's stronger and faster..
a genuine martial artist should understand that mma is trained for one purpose only while traditional martial  art is for the total development of a person. this older man is simply not.
I have joined womble being single once again,thanks womble for posting shit that can help me get over it,faggot

I still can't get over how well you subtitle all of your vids!!! AMAZING <3
I'm waiting for Nevil to just go "hey guys, I don't really talk like that I just talk like that to fuck with you guys"
What do you use to edit? Like to throw text around and such
Woah martha has that rare service medal

Old inferno mmmmm sloppy
Nep's "'hello'' at 1:59 gave me boner that lasted 2 hours.

I don't expect anyone to do this but if i could get some feedback on my videos I would appreciate it a lot, it's really fun making them but I always want to improve :)
I fucking died laughing when you have that poster with a sun on it a face in cache 😂😂
"Keep in mind that it takes me three days to respawn" Fucking ded
60% of the comment are about Nep's sensual voice but nobody comments that Womble was getting in the zone playing this time around XD

Nep sounds hot as fuck.  I really want to fuck her.
anyone came from Taylor's instagram ? 😂😂
I'm a simple man. I see an all-sister band, I LIKE.
uploaded on my birthday too, thanks haim, best gift.
why haim is so perfect?
Taylor Swift really has good tast in music
Grimes orgasmed at the end.
I'm getting some Bangles vibes with those harmonies. 2017 has some great releases so far.
Taylor Swift brought me here
Missed my girls <33
Came here from Medusa's Instagram
is this happening!? <3
who is hear after taylor swift insta?
I don't know why Alvin and the chipmunks closed out the song but I approve.
Honestly, they can do wrong.
Much better than Right Now
taylor swift brought me here
this band is just... perfection!
This could be easily a The 1975 song in my opinion. Quite similar style! And It is not a criticism
They are really good. This group can replace 5H. atleast I think they can!
Sounds like Taylor singing this to Calvin
Those Hanson / Celine Dion / The 1975 vibes tho...
This is a pile of shit.
That 90's vibe 😎😍🎵
okay is it me or does whoever is singing sound like sara bareilles?
Taylor brought me here
wow just wow
PERFECTION!! <3
Like..... if you here after Taylor swift's Instagram post abt this song
That bass face.
i love that you guys are back!!!!
I like that it seems new HAIM songs keep popping up every week now.:)
It kind of sounds like 90s adult alternative
Why can't this become a hit.American sucks.
Here for the queens & taylor.
who is here after taylor swift posted on Instagram?😊😊
I've been listening to this song on repeat for the last 24 hours. obsessed
The three goddesses are back! Haim very happy right now!
i love this song to the moon and back
WELL STOP ASKING BECAUSE I'M NOT HERE BECAUSE OF TAYLOR. I LOVE YOU SO FUCKING MUCH HAIM
I'm just here because Taylor Swift
slayy with the come back queens 😍
get it haim!!!
My ears have been blessed 👏👏
here,  'cause of TS 😊😁😍
https://open.spotify.com/album/79VQJpJQWcBHaH9jTjIlqP
It's a superb presentation of an excellent song. Oh, and the production values are off the charts they are so good.  These sisters keep bringing it!
Kind of Alanis Morissette vibes
BASS BASS BASS BASS BASS
Saw this on Taylor's Instagram account
Who's here seeing Taylor swift's instagram???
Before I came here, i was at paramore's... New stuff just keeps on going... Hallelujah 2017!!! Let us rejoice. And im still waiting for Lorde's Melodrama, just so u know...
Any lyrics provided ?
Did Taylor wrote this ? it sounds so her 💙
Is this like the female version of Hanson? Their music is just as shitty.
Love it! Looking forward to the new album🎶🎵
this is so disappointing. what the hell happened to them??? this is so generic.
It's alright, sounds like and 80's track, not revolutionary.
the most talented girls
This is going to be the album of my summer. I can just feel it!
This is the song that I never knew I needed until now.
Guys who knew about this song from Taylor's post is instagram?
= ___=)   dunno if trust you..  😟 ..
This is so haim. So much love for them. ❤️
Taylor Swift brought me here
Replay. Till The  End Timeeeees.
I don't like the lack of drums I hear, but it's such a beautiful song, such a summer vibes song for a road trip maybe, and Alana's solo w.w yes I live for hearing Alana sing hope she gets more solos on the album :)
I'm here because Taylor Swift's instagram post. And i loveeeee
The chorus reminds me really strongly of another song but I have any idea what it is.  Can anyone help me out?  I think it's an older 90s/80s song but can't be too sure.
taylor swift like this song... amazing
Taylor swift sent me here !! 😍
I'm here because of Tay... am I alone? Love This song❤✨
GAH THE BASS
Paramore and HAIM are killing me <3 Good days of music are coming! :D

A   M   A   Z   I   N   G   !   !
111166666)))!
Yey! Colorful surprise eggs!
Maybe your best yet. Keep 'em coming!
please make Anchorman like a serious movie like spotlight
Oh, that is _so_ twisted! Loved it!
You fly back to school now, little starling ❤
This is absolutely incredible. You guys never, ever fail to impress.
how about making a difference between movie and book version of scilence of the lambs?
Funny. Would have benefited from some stereotypical background romcom standard songs. Like 'Solsbury Hill' in the Shining version of this. The music nails it.
should've added some RomCom background music
this is amazing
hahaah this is messed up
Hilarious, and so well done. It just shows what you can do with a clever voice over and and editor. Brilliant.
the beauty of editing
They should have Will Graham in this and make it a love triangle. lol
Pretty sure you killed Jonathan Demme with this.
RIP Jonathan Demme.
Woooah that was epic.
rip jonathan demme, the silence of the lambs director :(
Where is the sex scene?
You killed Jonathan Demme.
Very funny!
An eerily timed video, Cinefix. Rest in peace, Jonathan Demme.
Aww So Cute
This is good!
"Jodi" Foster??
omg....this was epic😂😂😂
I definitely thought it was gonna say, "turning heads is easier than getting head"
this makes me EXTREMELY uncomfortable...like wow lmfao
Please make: animal farm what's the difference  I need it for a book report.
the thing is, hannibal does love her.it's definitely not a rom-com though.
This would work great, and it does until you have to show Hannibal - He's just far too creepy even when it's cut like this.
I think Hannibal still sounds creepy when he talks :D
Do "Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom (1975)" as a family movie
MAKE STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT 2FULL TRALIER CINEFX PLEASEEEE
Still no staff picks for March?
This is definitely creative and a perfect trailer!
are you hitting on me doctor? oh my goodness I almost died.
It's funny because if you've read the novels this is how it ends.
Can somebody please tell me how to do the trailer mixes
Infinitely better than Twilight!
the narration and text ruined it for me.
I can't tell if this is terrifyingly hilarious or hilariously terrifying.
Do homemade Thor 3 trailer
Good try... ;)
It's still creepy because of the way director Jonathan Demme filmed all those close ups of the actors looking into the camera.
This works for her, but not for him. That creepy voice has too many connotations.
It's funnier when you realize the original movie premiered on Valentine's Day 1991
laughed my ass off all the way through
In the sequel book Hannibal and Clarice become lovers.
Schindler's List as a Santa Claus movie. He's making a list. He's checking it twice. He's gonna find out who is German or Semite, Oskar Schindler is coming to town to save the Jews.
Best trailer ever *LOL* wahahahahha
Oh wow! O_O I would like to watch this version of the film! :D
1:14 "Bars couldn't keep them apart" Yeah...but he wasn't behind bars
Man, Jodie Foster has an amazing smile!
He'll eat your heart out!
C'mon, fix the spelling. It's Jodie, not Jodi.
Do a homemade film on the social network!!!!
That doesn't really work Ha Ha
I don't know how to feel about this. like what? what did I jist watch. it makes the movie even creepier.
I am laughing my arse off this was amazing. Terrible font, but amazing song choice.
This makes me uncomfortable
😂😂😂 this is great ❤️
dude, you guys should recreate the justice league trailer i'd like to see how you guys could do it, just giving an idea though anyways keep up the good work.
That announcer voice totally makes it.
wait....it wasnt a romantic comedy to begin with??
Well, considering the books, this is kind of accurate.
Huh, Silence of the Lambs seems like a nice movie. I'll have to check it out.
looks good,  I'm going to see it
Would need a more uplifting recoloring to be more like a romcom, otherwise nice job. :)
Brilliant; goes to show what music and editing can do. Although I was hoping for, "take this thing back to Baltimore," and "love the suit," to make it in there somewhere.
insta sub! this cracked me up.
Still a better love story than Twilight.
Do Fight Club as a rom com
You can come with us.
And not one drop was spilt that night🍻
either I am getting old or these old people like good tunes.
That's my kinda Pub. Brilliant.
thanks to who posted this what a send of got to go theres whisky in the jaro
Am I the only one who sang along xD

True friends.

Proud to be irish🇮🇪
It's made out to be about the poor cunt who's died, but it's not. It's about the fat sweaty arsehole pissed out of his brain. No respect, no consideration, no manners.
Drunk culchie fuckers. Drop a bomb on them, they are worthless.
I want be remembered like this

This makes me sick
Now that's the way to be remembered, fair fucking play to them 🇮🇪
I don't know who Mr Foley is or was... But he must of been one hell of a person to deserve friends like that. Hats off to you Mr Foley, where ever you are.
Ah, it looks like it's beginning to rain.
this is truly beautiful
I really want this kind of send off :)
When I go belly up I want my children to give me this kind of send off.
Awesome performance - and what a send off for their friend. Fantastic !
Love from Sweden!!!
this is fucking awesome
When I die at my wake I want this
hopefully rep of ireland have supporters like this crowd at the euros they will not only drink the town dry but do the country proud not like the english fans that cant even hold a pint
I could watch this video a thousand times brings a smile to my face every time farmer had a bunch of great friends rip  # Irish pride
I wanna go out like this.
That was fucking awesome
Somehow this makes me proud to be Irish☘

farewell 30 seconds
Still got nothing on that time Chelsea reps met Ashley Cole in a hotel room.
LUKAKU...more like LU-BLACK-U! am I right?
Luckily I was scratching my balls while watching this , so not a totally wasted 30 seconds...
Hahahhahahahhahaa fucking state of this video
in a nutshell. 2 men greeting each other. ffs
He should go to Bayern.
plot twist that's actually stormzy
Hi Claude, Can we use this footage in our transfer talk video today?! we'll credit your channel
They are only talking, but if i was Lukaku I wouldn't go back to a team that loaned me out twice and then sold me what's the point start fresh. Come Untied you and Barkley for a total of £110m and lets make History.
WTF was the creepy "cmon" all about. Shit ass video.
probably just sharing chicken recipes
Plz chelski take lukaku for a 100m
Well that's 30 seconds I won't get back
lukaku is such a fucking snake
hope the fuckin cunt goes..
They know each other... If you watch any Tunnel Cam videos, you would realise that this is normal  Sure, he might be coming back to Chelsea, but this video means fuck all
In other words lukaku saying goodbye
Can the man not have a conversation for Christs sake...
Hi Claude, is it possible to use this video on the Liverpool Echo with a credit and link back?
i think emanalo's just being nice
Re sign a first touch chaser and someone who disappears in big games? no thanks
great video! come check my channel out please
You goon 😂 they know each other from when Lukaku was at Chelsea  ....
Really? You think these people don't know each other already? Fuck sake, this is embarrassing watching you all read into this.
I'm hope his Chelsea's return!!! Backaku!!
Hi Claude, is it possible to use this video on the Mirror Online with a credit and link back?
Surely it looks like the move is on
THATS IT! THATS THE LAST STRAW ON YALL TELLING THE RULES AGAIN FOR LIKE THE 48 TIME IN A ROW. #wealreayknowtherulesman #finebrossuck

No one could believe it, nor would they. But Gabe was the chosen one after all...
The first one got me

6:26 and that was the moment Carson knew he had messed up 😂😂
Why does Carson not have a top lip
I already laughed at the first video 😭
LOL the kid that was singing the Australian national anthem... I feel bad for him
When the Australian anthem came in 🙂🙂🙂
Is gabe a boy or a girl? df
I thought Carson was the chosen one, he had such a bright future ahead of him. He could've been a star. But he failed us
5:30 BEST MEME EVAH!!!
6:25 that moment when you completely forget it's a try not to laugh challenge

OMG that little boy was soooooo cute! I want him as my brother!!!!
I literally screamed when Carson slipped hahahahaha
#ShareTheLove
We all must salute the hiccup kid
We were all rooting for Carson
Would you ever consider expanding Alphalete on a larger scale? I just finished 4 years of college in Business Management and would love the opportunity to work for a brand that I believe in and love!
Damn becca is soo pretty!
Alphalete jeans.. though they may be a bit too much.. I wouldn't complain🤔
Pretty much every thing they could do wrong with dogs they do it... I feel bad for them honestly
8:54 the way she looks at you
YouTube's the type of place where people argue in the comments about who should date who.
Everyone loves the original stringers and I'm sure the V2 would be even better!
Doubt Christian will see this, but the person (or organization) being impersonated must file a report themselves.  All the fans can do block the Account.  Should be pretty easy to do.  Good luck!
Becca's a tough one , you see the way she told that dog to sit? she a freak believe that
I would LOVE IT if you guys made jeans....that fit people who workout
Who's becca? roommate?
This guy is cringe master
Hey does anyone know what the name of the food scale he uses?
Hi Christian, how did you first get your apparel to launch?
we want shorts, crew neck sweaters & lifestyle long sleeves dude !!!
I just wanna know where Becca got her pants 😍
Ask Becca to go out on a date with me!
lawrence the type of guy to hold his phone upside down during a video call lol
who else is waiting for the next VLOG?
I'd learn to video edit and film Christian's workouts just to get close to my girl Becca. Sometimes you don't realize what you got until it's gone. Becca wants you CG.
Do make jeans! There are so few companies who make jeans for fit people!
Christian the type of guy to fall asleep during a vlog and still get 1mil views
Christian is def slippin Becca some D on the side
Becca is fun!
why does becca drive u..cant u drive?
Do tours to different gyms in different areas
should do a large volunteer event with all the team.
EXPO "period" is OVER !!! I FULLY AGREE with your thoughts on pulling out, its the Number 1 best move for your brand and that money could ACTUALLY Be monitored on social media marketing. DONE !!, B
Christian the type of dude to stop the vlogs whilst heidi's on her period
When Christian announced he was dating Heidi some wanted to literally kill them because she was Nikki's friend.... now all I can read about is "Christian date Becca!"  and she is one of Nikki's best friend" ...     🤔
Becca sounds like she could take a few cocks at once
Don't let this distract you from the fact that project X is an Energy drink called 'UP Energy'
Becca's eyes are so beautiful
Ayee me and guzzy have the same phone background ;)
Becca let me tear that ass apart
Glad I watched this video, I've recently started to watch/follow you and genuinely thought this was one of your pages. Disgusting some people trying to ride on the success you've created.
This nigga has no word
That awkward moment when Christian is reconsidering Lawrence to join Alphalete after FaceTiming him upside down....
it's only a matter of time until we get the Heidi break up video into the full "I've loved Becca all along"
Are they alphalete joggers he is wearing in this video?
The lack of sleep you get and energy drinks you drink daily makes me feel ill
I want Becca..
Glad to see your mom recovering so fast!
anyone else agrees with me that Becca's smile/laughter is friggin 10/10?! 😁
I could watch becca all day. My bday is soon and all I want is to suck a fart out her ass and hold it like a bong hit 
You should make Alphalete bathing suits for guys and girls :) for Summer shredding!!
Whatever happened to that icon meals sponsorship hah
Your mom is beautiful ❤
Make the jeans
Bring back the stringers
christian the type of dude to wipe his ass after he farts
That's why i HATE  pm/am  system...
Christian the type of nigga to hit a side tricep for his wedding pics😂😂
Love and support to your mamma!
Becca is perfect
I love Becci ❤ she is The top
Your mum is looking fantastic Christian! 🙌🏾
should come out with a line of distressed lifestyle shits!!!!
You pushing the fitness and Lifestyle sounds amazing!  I think you need some jacket and push Women clothing a bit more so your well rounded!
SPACE JAM PREWORKOUT!!!!!!!!
CG is the type of CG that will CG on CG at 12:45 p.m instead of 00:45 a.m
If you only had an alt logo like the lulu stitch, the clothes would be amazing but unfortunately the wolf thing is too GymY for lack of a better term
christian the type of dude to snort preworkout off becca's ass
I made a stupid mistake and watched this crap.
You will marry Becca no joke
the quality cam is everything <3
damn I was gonna start cuttting for summer next month 😂😂
you should get all the athletes (and alphalete staff?) together for a spartan race or tough mudder. or hell, create your own obstacle events as fan meetups
16:40 System of a down type of workout!
Am I the only one or would CG and Bekka actually make a cute couple? After watching this video you can agree honestly
Christian type of guy to wash his hands before and after when he goes to  the restroom ..
Yo your girl is super chill....
My mans getting his eyebrows done
Christian the type of guy who looks the same every time he shreds down lol
Christian the type of dude to fuck up and not date becca. 😢
CG the type of guy to breakup with Heidi and get with Becca .. oh wait ..
You should do a military tour, travel to different military bases around the world to meet up! #japan 😜
Do it with the jean? Just try it, because I love everything bro. Keep up the good work, and enjoy the blessings. If you all need someone to cook for an event, I would love to help Gmom
Hey Chris man I seen dude on Instagram and I really was confuse about him having your company name. I was really mad when I seen dude. I really was like I know that you are copy right for the company
I just found your channel and your videos are so inspiring ! I've been eating healthier & working out more for the fast two weeks. And by watching your vlogs, it makes me work harder.
Damn Becca and Goomah looked so cute together in the car <3
CG the type of guy to title the video "This is why I need her" just because she helped set up Lawrence's room
Becca is fine as shyt!!
I really enjoyed the video as you actually take the products out of the boxes👌🏻 Don't usually like videos but this definitely deserved a thumbs up👍🏻 Keep it up Judner.
A modele kit what? You average I love your vids though
i feel poor after watching this
SETUPS FTW!!!!!! ANDROID FTW!!!! XBOX FTW!!!!!!!! ANYTHING THAT IS EVEN REMOTELY TECH RELATED FTW!!!! sorry LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE tech.
Super envious. Nothing better than a bunch of Amazon boxes. I need those Xbox controller stands. I have a few controllers myself. Dope idea.
Cool video! You made it interesting and fun! I liked how you included your wife/girlfriend in the video too. :)
Man those nanoleafs are cool
UrAvgConsumer is never gonna pin this comment.
You should have bought a micro cut shredder, which is more secure and not a crosscut shredder.
I knew he would have a gundam box at the end
very cool knife! Where can i buy it?
did not expect the zaku. Awesome
review on shredder
My uncle just barely got his hands on one, but I wish I had one too.
UrAvgConsumer, where did you go to customize your white, teal, and grey Xbox one controller?
Yes, review that paper shredder! 😂
Gundams suck and so do you You'll be broke, I hope it's true
th name of this channel makes no sense nothing of what he shows is average and with the money he makes he is not an average consumer at all
roses are red violets are blue paper on your ass eww show me wat dat mouth do
good work on the video man! you always show stuff that would have otherwise be very little known. I like your couch btw
I love your unboxings. Your focus on tech stuff not only the expensive but also the cheaper and useful ones. Kudos
i love his set up and colors on the switch. Keep doing what you're doing UrAvgConsumer.
Came here for the paper shredder.  Wasn't disappointed.
how did you find the Kingtop Switch case? It looks kinda cool... Am thinking of picking one up for myself.
nitendo switch tech most
Keep up the good work my man
whats your unboxing knife
Narcissistic nerds. Stop showing off for your own reassurance.
what kind of knife is that?
It's my first time checking out your video and I have to say the way you explain what everything is and what it is used for is great keep up the good reviews. #Officially Subscribed
I've been wondering about those lights in the background!  Thanks for the video!
you can't go wrong with black, it's funny because he is black
The weird thing is that I'm actually interested in the paper shredder review.
psycho sai looks beast
can i know what gundam you build,i'm a gundam builder myself
I'd really like to see what you think of the Gear S3 Frontier Jud.
I think you need to be hooked up with a new knife to do your unboxing...
You should get a pro/ultimate nintendo switch backpack
I love your unboxing videos. There are so many great gadgets! Keep Up the good work!
These tech unboxings r really awesome u should keep doing them!!!
the tour for the gamers paradise was sooo awsome
wow I hope I win the giveaway for the Samsung s8
anyone knows when the giveaway for the colorware thing is happening
The whole point of a case is to protect the device you dumb fuck! This "guy" is an absolute retard
Make a video on what to give on mothers day
that was amazing,
Please review the PowerShred 64Cb, because I never know if a shredder is good or not 😄
The last one was dope. Hope to see it fully assembled
can you please give me the link of the watch you are wearing?? its looking cool. :)
nice unboxing of latest gear.
Bro you have to watch the gundam series....
You sir just gained another subscriber
Video 2nd title...Cry you poor son of a bitches while I open all my free tech.
Man that would be dope to win a switch!!! 👀😂👀
Gundam X3 Sgt. Frog would be proud
Of course I got a ad for Amazon..

Selfish on the last one.... Really Gundums really?...
My all time favorite YouTuber ;)
That Switch case looks bad.
YES !  YES  !
This 🥔 will be your friend
great video :)
Can you tell me what those triangle light are? Wich brand?
The only things I ever misplace are my wallet and my portable charger 😂
i like the gear watch !
Clear phone cases are always ugly.
I've never liked clear cases. They're great in theory, but noooooo.
damn youtuber is really rich right? damn All The tech that he Unbox must cost a lot
Is unboxing stuff a fetish?
Picture B looks more natural to me...Picture A looks over saturated.... probably can do with some tweaking in the settings...
man I'd like to have all of that stuff 😖 awesome video anyway!  I really like your passion for sleek and minimalistic setups which you show again in this vid with the macbook stand 😊
I like the style of this video you should do more unboxing videos like this!
i hope that psyco zaku will be appear in upcoming videos. It will be better if there's MG Full Armor Gundam (Thunderbolt ver.) too
It's like chirstmas for you in April...loots of gifts..love your videos.
Love the massive Unboxings. Cannot wait to the next one. Defenetevely going to buy some of the tech in this video, such as the Samsung Gear S3.
Who think PNB rock looks like PG and KG mixed
dude killed this, who heard his new track? twostep by young thug look it up
dude both the Dodges look sick
Check out "Critic - On My Way" the video is ridiculous, inspired by paul walker
2:27 is this a burp? 🔥🔥🔥
Somebody send me good songs
All 3 of the rappers made this song lit! REspect ✊ to fast and furious franchise for making some of the best songs...shame that they are only making 2 more movies 🎥😥
This song makes me want to put the socks on the shoes
Young Thug the only reason I listen to this shit.
Like how this happens after Paul passed. SMH. this commitment should've been given from the first Fast and Furious. F* y'all and the industry! 😡
Team_Vietnamese
PND rock is the best part of the song
Get out of satan system & get in God system ⏳ your lifestyle has to match your heart if you love God
the part when he says stay calm. holyyy
facts he did
i dont care what you guy say young thug did not ruin the song
What a great song! listen to it all the time.
The word would be better without white people so then they wouldn't shoot all these black people
Fuck white people and there county music this shit to good
young thug killed that shit
I LOVE THE CHORUS
*The Fate of the Furious (2017) Movie Available in ( HD )* Click to watch : ( https://plus.google.com/+IvanBanderasSpd/posts/TAJ7w6xiiTb )
2 chainz is the goat 🐐

I thought Ty Dolla sign sang the chorus the whole time lol. Nice one Pnb Rock..
Special bomb

2 Chainz killed it XD
PnB seriously killed it
only lame niggas is this 3 😂
This video so Gangsta's man
guys there's a burp in 2:27 listen carefully
Why is a young version of Will smith in this music video
Wiz is the life of the Furious
I hate when there's an ad for fast and furious 8 before this song
all but the red cars blue for life
Well that's nice they are accepting mentally ill
2 chains ruined it
Thug KILLED It!
love the song but damm the doge demon love them I have on so sick best car
why was this posted on young thung's vevo like wtf it should on Pnbs vevo tbh young thungs verse i cold barley understand what he said
If I put on captions for young thugs part it would come up as error
At the beginning it looked like pnb rock wanted to test the auto tune out, lol
Wiz look ugly asf with those glasses
You guys that don't like it are trash and need to stop being haters😠🔥😠👎✌
love it is a best song ever
Pnb rock is ass. But whatever
I list to this 20 times a week
"I aint talkin seatbelts when I say im strapped" 2 Chainz is the fucking GOAT LMAAOOOOO
PNB Rock so underrated

2 chains is also trash

We love you Peter! and all those behind the scenes.  You are loved!
Keep this man safe!
The irony of the need for money while attempting to eliminate money LOL
WOW I just sent a letter to the movement   and then I clicked on  this  you are asking for money UNBELIEVABLE....SO YOU ARE PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT YOU ARE SAYING IS SO CORRUPT   SHAME ON YOU
Peter, where did you go? Drop on let us know your alive.
Can we get a Video introduction of the board introducing themselves and their "story" of how they got involved and what they personally see as their contribution to the future of TZM.
how can i get involved?
Good news. VERY GOOD NEWS. Keep educating people on this wonderful new direction. :) I Applaud every ones efforts across the globe to raise awareness.
Caring is often times a luxury, so true sadly
Well, playing along with the bullshit, is necessary on some level.
Thank god for the positive people in the world who are fighting back the corruption and finding solutions rather than providing division and blame.
We share ideas about how something should be done, made, or thought about everyday. Blocking ideas or trashing them is ignorance, labeling ideas as idiotic just to humiliate the provider is hate.
Such awesome news! So now down with the IRS! Right? I'd say that should be near the top of the list.
Thank you Peter for everything.
I wish this guy could debate David Duke
Cool! Congratulations. All my support.
Finally Bill Gates has something TZM related to donate to.
What could I do to help get the Colorado chapter of the movement going again?
Who is on the board of directors?
I'd like to hear Peter Joseph say "I'm not even supposed to be here today." He looks just like Dante from Clerks.
Fantastic, great to see progress.
Can't wait to hit the Mega Millions lottery, walk into CBS, NBC, and ABC, Drop $50 million on the counter to show Zeitgeist during prime time on Sunday night and see what happens. A man can dare to dream...
TZM NPO just sounds like an extensional tool of TZM, designed to be effective in the current environment. Makes sense, as long as TZM is not bound to the NPO's fate, whose prospects we can surmise based on experience.
As sad as it is, to get anything done in this world you need money, that includes activism.
With good intentions at the heart of action, only good things will result with an organized movement like TZM :-)
makes sense to me, until we can change things we have to adapt to the system we have in place already.
I support this move by TZM.  Lets get things done!  ; )
plenty of people on the streets of  France to go talk to.  Share information and ideas.
Just a FYI...there are meeting places..all over the place.. it's called the street. I know TZM is to good for that type of action or just scared.
This will move us forward, thank you Peter.
Thanks for creating competition to money world.
I applaude TZM attempt but the problem is that goods productions are limited while human desires are not.
Greate move! Keep the good work!
I fucking love you peter we're fighting the good fight
I'm a software developer, you may message me if you need some work done for TZM, I'd be glad to help. Free of course
I. AM. SO. GEEKED.  This means so many amazing things will come so much easier.
As long as it's completely transparent, there should not be a problem. Those reports are very important! :)
Get Ready For A World Currency - 2018
AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Hi Peter! Good to see you again :)
LoL. 9 dislikes within 24 hours. The ancient trolls who were saying for years TZM is dead are still lurking in the shadows like demonic psychopaths. Trying to create Heaven on Earth apparently attracts the 'opposition.'
Sharing, Justice and Peace for All - Save Our Planet.
Like your namesake Peter, you are a Rock! Good on you for taking this important step forward on behalf of the Movement!
4:10 where can people donate in bitcoins, dogecoins, litecoins, etc.?
I wonder if interreflections will be released strategically now. Either way it will be good to see.   Keep up the good work Joseph and everyone else. Change is the only constant, it is inevitable it will come.
An understandable and necessary step.  Keep fighting the good fight.
Good to see you!!!
Good job Peter the world needs you
About time TZM. Money is only a tool at this time.  As things progress hopefully the tool will become obsolete.   At this point in time use the tools that are given to you. Well done.
I understand why they waited. and now i can understand why they've started forward with this. Here's hoping we don't become another failed experiment...
When can we start spreading the Zeitgeist message to Muslim countries?
A very well-deserved congratulations, TZM! I hope this new status will garner exposure and support for the movement, but simultaneously keep its core grassroots ethics. Way to go!
Awesome stuff. Can't wait to see what this will do for the movement.
This makes me happy.
Peter Joseph your awesome! As is the many beautiful people that are taking action with you. We need transition mechanism blueprints for ideal ways to fade money out of transaction. Basic income? Where can we find it?
Extremely excited to see TZM begin this new phase. Hopefully the message can now permeate society at a deeper level. Look forward to seeing the results!
I think its a good move.
Just like to hear him talk. Can't wait for interreflections
YES!... I was worried so much! We are team. We are friends. This is just the beginning! (although it took us 8 years)
Love you peter. Thank you and everyone.
hurrah !  glad to see this marvelous movement becoming more efficient, bigger n better ...keep up the great work.
Thank you Peter. You are a good selfless man who has already sacrificed so much for the common good. We love you mate!
I want to see it
Can u guys translate in english for me.  Lol. Thanks
Guys i just want to ask if anyone here recognises me?
his daughters are ugly, genetic from his ugly father.
Lesson of the day is. Here have a beer and chill dafug down =))) LOL
Damn this was actually very good!
Why y'all gotta hate on Pepsi though. Heineken ain't throwing shade, that's not what this is about.
Heinken should stick to damaging livers and worry less about changing the world for the better.
Would've been a great commercial if it didn't lean so far to the left and instead tried to appeal to both sides better.
this spot is amazing and the black girl looks too beautiful, anyone knows her Instagram?
Try this experiment after they've been drinking beer for a few hours...
absolutely beautiful.... we need more of this in the world.
Loving this. Way to go Pepsi! Oh I mean Heineken (haha genuine mistake, I swear!)
On point... However I also suddenly visualized a crispy cold formaldehyde headache inducing mass-produced beer. I'd much prefer to be brainwashed into a good bourbon with my joyful acceptance of humanity...
I actually really enjoyed this
I love This
Really made me think... 🤔
Love this commercial. I don't drink beer but honestly wanted a Heineken just to show my support of this add
Best commercial campaign ever! If I were going to start drinking beer, I'd try Heineken first.
I don't drink beer, but this commercial is awesome!
Damn this is beautiful. Wish I was old enough to drink tho lol
Trump and Obama do the same exercise-I'd love to see that. "A narcissist and a normal guy walk into a bar..."
I don't like politics in commercials but at least this one was properly made and nice to watch.
i'm looking fwd to the follow-up titled "6 Beers Later."
are they for real with this shit
Too long, otherwise ok!
This is the fucking coolest Advertisment ever!!!! great work, really challenges your thoughts.
Well done Heineken. Thank you for making this video
Watch out brits ! Never replace your tea rituals with this :D
Well thought out and presented. if only.......
I was cringing so hard
I'd like an apple juice as I'm underage thank you very much
People who dislike this are the kind of feminist who just hate men 100% or they're stupid, i dont see stuff wrong with this
i thought this was really good
Look at the comments below...disconcerting. The point being look for common ground, it's there.
This is amazing..absolutely awesome.
They should had just had a Pepsi
moral of the story : if you are about to have a serious debate with someone, have a beer first bud'
Interesting experiment.but lets be honest ...they only showed 3 pairs of people.  How many failed and walked out?  I would like to see both sides.
tsk tsk white men
incredible commercial
Glad to see that we're getting there.
From my point of view the Jedi are evil.
love this fucking commercial. agree or disagree just watch and listen. for me its about getting to know who the person is and just sit down with a person and talk and listen. get to know people
Wow that was actually a really well done ad. Well, at least better than what Bud did with Amy Schumer & Seth Rogan in any case.
Wonderful! There is hope!
what a load of crap...
Heineken pulled a Pepsi lol, have they really learned nothing?
I love this! Thank you!
what if one of them didn't drink?
why don't they have Dutch accents?
Not shown: the shouting matches that ensued, followed by "YOU'RE WRONG!" "NUH-UH YOU ARE!" back and forth.
More social engineering; unfortunately most people are far too stupid to see through it.
THIS IS SO GOOD
Oh look it's a beverage company bringing up political views without being autistic fucks. Rip Pepsi
Take that Pepsi
https://www.twitch.tv/samssi10
Such an awesome ad🙌🏽
really interesting. i wonder how many other 'couples' weren't interesting or conciliatory enough to make the cut. Although it gave me hope, I feel the circumstances were a little contrived.
it's a good message. stop being so triggered and cynical ://. this is why we never get anywhere.
Scripted much?
LOVE THE ENDING BEAUTIFUL
another label "put women in rooms with dangerous individuals"
well done, it's an amazing commercial
Damn you for making me feel things! Why am I sitting here crying and laughing at the same time!?!? It's very conflicting to be both sad and happy at the same time. What have you done to me?!?....thank you.
I'd need a case of vodka to get around this one, and it would not be good commercial i'll tell you that much..
this was nice  eat your heart out pepsi
Hahahaha thatone guy trying to Smash the trany
How is any of this bullshit good for White people?  Why should White people step aside and allow ourselves to become minorities in our own countries?
Good Commercial, pepsi could learn something
Well they didn't waaaaaaay better than pepsi.
Yes, sure, because everyone likes beer.
Bet after another 10 beers they'd all be punching each other....
Physically remove beta leftists!
Dear Heineken: How many sets of people did you have to go through until you got the perfect responses you were looking for in this "social experiement?"
Alcohol is good for some problems but weed is better. Pepsi better start selling weed.
Oh my god I'm so perfect for this. Is there an american version?  How do I sign up???
how can people dislike this video
but why did the right guy have to look like a bald skinhead?
Anyone who thinks this is offensive as the Pepsi commercial needs a new lense to view the world. The Kardashian bs is w/o thought and is a ATM for the dreaded Chris !!!
Nice ad. Shame about the beer.
Very touching...  ;(
who else is crying? 😭😭😭

Well, I like forward to reviewing this
I want, so much. Can't wait.
This movie looks so goddamn fucking stupid even the title is retarded
I don't know why I cringe throughout the trailer.
Whelp! No need to buy a ticket. Just watch the entire movie.
Damn she got finer, she played Rue in the first Hunger Games movie! Sexy bitch is thick! Big ass breast, and a fat booty, so yeah I want to fuck her!
0:29 *Everything, Everything* M0VIE [ plus.google.com/u/0/+FileVIDmov/posts/DfKLrD84YhV ]
*Everything, Everything* #fuIImovie  [ plus.google.com/u/0/+FileVIDmov/posts/DfKLrD84YhV ]
The thumbnail brought me here, she's really pretty. but the movie itself doesn't look promising
I read the book can't wait for the movie😃😃😃🤗
Rue from hunger games it's been so long
Fuking piss i havent seen a black on black love movie like this eversince Boomerang like wtf is going on ? sigh..... its been interracial dating lately " not being racist its just what im into"
Like Bubble Boy -- except with a girl.  Bubble Chick.
What is the song between the trailers?
they did the complete soundtrack before they even started the movie lol  still though I hope it makes a ton of money.
is the girl Rue from the Hunger Games?
Rue ....D''':
The art of making a trailer is lost forever
Wait wait, isn't she the girl who played Rue? in Hunger Games? xD idek but.
the black girl likes a guy named molly, which is a drug, the black girl than goes to the hospital
Show the whole film in one trailer ok then
The girl is quite the looker. Too bad this is just more derivative YA nonsense. But there's an audience for that. Can't hate them for liking the stories they do.
he just want dat pussy
noooope. Keep races pure. Well, just the one with melanin.
why does she have shoes if she can't go outside
the boy in the bubble
SAY MOORS! SAY MOORS!..........Moops
Guys I swear I just got.$2670.free.money from this amazing website: (just type in g00gle)=> *_freeppalmon xyz_*
Dont mke falt in r star agen
Don't put good music in bad movies, gosh...
I wonder how she can swim if she's never been outside
I would fall in love with boobs like that too.
this looks like bullshit
I read the book and it was fucking amazing. Expecting a lot from this...
I completed reading this book months ago! I can't wait to watch it on big screen 😭😭
it was better when Beyonce was singing in it
She's a beauty!
When the ad before was the exact trailer 😂
I saw a really cute thumbnail and i clicked, this being said there's no way i'm wasting my money on this crap
she too bad to be sick
this is nothing more than boy in the bubble,
A modern Boy in the Bubble. Can it deliver?
Wait so this is that emoji bullshit? That I saw a few days ago?
Looks alright for a young adults movie.
the most overhyped movie I've seen lately
Cmon give me new Transformers The Last knight trailer
Best Song for the Film!!! Love! Life! Everything
TOTALLY not ripping of Bubble Boy.. TOTALLY not. Lul.. ommg why cant hollywood get creative..? xD just ripping off other movies.

5:38 He's still probably taller than 70% of the population.
I'm actually used to the taste of blood because I get bloody noses a lot so the blood drains down my throat
#hairypotoatochip
Come on, Link! "Spiders is bacon!"
I like the the blood food because in sweden we eat this and its called blodpudding
It's funny to hear how happy Stevie is when she tells them what the foods are
always go for the middle block
The story, is so true!!!!
I do have a terrarium that could fit a family of rats. I keep degus in it though.
9:05 notice how his shirt matches the top two
Man, why are they so bad at Janga? They always make it so it's all balancing on one block at the very bottom.
I think they should do this again but this time they don't know what food goes with each color.
what was links mysterey?
can we get some hype for that introduction from link!!! love you guys, stay mythical :)
cubed blood is a delicacy here in the philippines, they're called "betamax"
just to see how bad it was the other day i ate some glue
What was in Link's mystery box?
They have like a whole live studio audience now lol
I'm loving their slightly matched shirts.
This is a nasty title and why?
I love watching you and your funny games!
THE MUSIC SCARES ME
12:46  When I pass my Mid-Year and End Of Year Exam
The guy on the right needs his old hair back
I'd take blood cubes over pig anus and spiders any day. Then again I actually like blood cubes with some soy sauce and ginger :P
0:40 Link just got high
Come on link you have eaten a skorpean
pigs blood is tasty tho
I love hearing the crew just die of laughter, someone was really laughing today
Did anyone notice that the picture to the top right of links head always changes to fit the episode.
The picture in the background is a Jenga tower. Now I know they change the picture to match the theme of the video.
They look like mustard and fries sauce
How long has this been going on, and how have I not found this sooner?!
,,,,, Chameleon
If it were up to me, they would all be a mystery.
funny how im only 12 and understood the game name ;0
people eat chiterlings all the time I would assume they have soooo i wouldn't think it be that bad
Half the comments: ooh shes tight-link. If course im a hypocrite bc thats what i came down here to do
I laughed so hard I farted after Rhett gagged on that second blood cube suddenly
I'm Australian so I think I would Actually like the marmite Twinkie it's just like Vegemite right?
Hmm...Panus    If you get that GMM reference I love you
"We're playing a slightly uh relaxed version of jenga." Proceeds to eat congealed blood, raw oysters covered with blue cheese, pig anus... You get the point😂😂😂
It must have been easy to pick out the items for Link's side; he hates 40,000 foods.
By far my favorite game title you guys have ever had!
I love this episode
Could you guys do will it soup or a pizza test from different restaurants? That would be awesome!
lol this is trending
All the dirty jokes. I'm proud.
The staff is so heartless.  Rhett- *about to throw up* Staff- *maniacal laughter*
get a man who makes you as happy as link eating a frosted mini wheat
get a girl who makes you as happy as link eating a frosted mini wheat
7:54 I think that's unsafe to eat
I'm amused.  I actually have rats that need a new tank.
When Rhett gags, you know it's bad
Do it for Elmer
That Rett's shirt tho. ❤ -they look like a little fruit salad of happiness 😂😍
i guess not a lot of things rhyme with jenga. also is jen my girlfriend yet
What!!!!!!!NO!!!!!!!!!Internet!!!!!!!
Can someone just make a compilation of Link's unintentional innuendos already?? 😂😂😂
12:38 😉👉👌 thats what he said 🤔😆
Rhett, you cheated.  You can't hold on to the tower while putting the block on top of the tower.  You deserve to lose.  Losing is your punishment for cheating.
This episode is so fun! The boys are really on their A game here
*GAGGING INTENSIFIES*
"It's not Boy Meets World, there is no Topanga" X'D X,D X`D
this was great
"panus cupcakes?!" and "this is just a hairy potato chip" had me dying 😂
Link: oh, daddy  Rhett: daddy's home.
did link just make an in living color reference?? 4:01
10:01 when your mom brings home food
I would not be surprised if the tower were small and it were an optical illusion.
How have you two not poisoned yourselves? Seriously, how are you still alive?
It's interesting that the blood is the red bucket. Is that a coincidence Rhett?
Before it falls link in the background lol
I want someone to talk about me with the enthusiasm that Link talks about his frosted mini wheats with
Anybody else wondering what was in links white bucket?
I love seaweed
Thanks for making  me laugh! "panus" -Link 2017
They do some messed up **** for this channel XD
did anyone else notice the constant moaning, whispering and weird phrases
"Let a man have a little time with his smokey"- Rhett
They should just have a permanent place on the trending page.
what was in link's mystery cup?
I died when link ate the spider😱😨😵😫
now yall are eating GLUE?! just imagine telling that to a docter. "i ate a smokey with some glue on it." XD but what you guys do for us is incredible
Why does Alex look like a mouse 😂😂😂😂😂😂
More importantly, David why do you always choose Jason as the sacrifice?
Jason, why do you let them do these things to you?
jason was a dick to her lmao
Who was the girl who Jason said "especially you!"
Why does Dom have a wig cap on in this
toddy is basically this giant puppy that everyone else cares for and picks up his shit, but he's cute so they deal with it.
"Idk what fucking college you came from but go stand in the other fucking room" HAHAHAHAHHA
Why do you guys put parentheses in the video now
Corrina and Alex have probably done it
anybody else notice that literally all of his vlogs are exactly 4:20 minutes long
What is the song
those awkward moments when you think you have been  subscribed since 2016 , ad it says "SUBSCRIBE" god dang ya nasty!!!
Alex scares me idkw he just does lol
"why do I hear screams without me recording!" lmao 😆😆😆😆
"Honestly sweetheart I'm going to fucking smack you in the face get out" 😂
What song is this?
david your hair is amazing dont have a haircut please
Why does David look like his jerking off an imaginary ghost every time he talks with his hands when he talks to the camera??
i fucking love alex lmao
DOES TODDY ACTUALLY HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?
copyied ComedyShortsGamer
anyone else see the length of the video ;)
'Why do I hear screams without me recording!?" 😭😭😭 Literally, the only logical question to ever ask during David's vlog.
Honestly sweetheart
an intro without david's laugh is no more an intro
Has anyone noticed he usually keeps his videos 4:21 long?
2:13 FUN FACT HIS SISTER IS TRANSGENDER
oh just now i realized why his vlogs are that long 420  sooo he has a girlfriend now😐😃
"Todd has a girlfriend now" whoops sorry guys
I think this is the BEST VLOG EVER.Jason is the oldest man that made me laugh😂😂
Easily one of my favourite vlogs
Todd's laugh and smile is so adorable I cant💕💕💕💕
really missed Alex in the vlogs....
Keep Alex in the vlogs plz he's funny
why the fuck was Dom wearing a du-rag
When we are here we never ever wanna hear the screams of death but this is hilarious!😂😂😂
i watch so many of your videos.. and for some reason i wasnt subscribed.. well.. I AM NOW!! LOL🤣🤣
See I don't like dom because I feel like dom like actually in real life is an asshole and deals like coke and heroin or something
"I don't know what fucking college you came from, but go in the other fucking room"  😂😂😂😂
David said they only had  1  black friend when he has Liza
What was the song in the outro?
XD I FUCKING WAS WATCHING THE VIDEO AND WHEN DAVID SAID "His mom made love with 2 chipmunks" I FUCKING DIED AND SPIT OUT MY SNAPPLE
There goes everyone's chances of being with Todd 😪💔
you should do something good or something bad instead
i'm sad now that todd has a gf
aye Kimmie minor in the outtro! love it
damnit Todd has a girlfriend D-:
Why does all of David dobrik's videos stop at 4:20🤔
Dang it can no longer call Todd a sex god.
i love toddy
Why did Jason turn into Grunkle Stan all of a sudden when he was getting off the wall?
alex is just stupid and waired
3:27 has me dead😂😂
meth Seth from 13reasons why
does anybody realize how almost every video is about 4:20? nice David Dobrik
I'm trying to do homework at 1:30 in the morning, but honestly it can wait another 4 minutes and twenty seconds
All of these Black Jokes are unnecessary
Dom looks like his morning anthem is "traffic traffic lookin fo my chapstick, feeling kinda car sick"
i choked on my water when i saw all of the fucking watermelon
Mouth dropped open when I saw the fridge full of watermelons. lol smh.
The Kian and Jc book
David is a savage😹
Alex was high asf
Alex looks high at the beginning
I DONT KNOW WHAT FUCKING COLLEGE YOU CAME FROM BUT GO STAND IN THE OTHER ROOM 😂😂😂 omg hilarious
Less Scotty, more bailey
He is supposed to post today what happened
durte dom in a fucking du rag? man, fuck the internet..
i had no idea that watermelon-itis  was  a real thing but i think Tod sumed that up for all of us. XD
This god damn shirt again, really Alex?
who's just waiting for David to upload his new vlog
Jason's birthday is tomorrow. Just a heads up😂
this is not a vlog because its only 4 mins
jesus christ my dad is in the fucking room and all you can hear is cum this cum that lmao STAWP
Just waiting for the new vlog
Jason's so fucking rude to that girl???
Has anyone received their David dobrik vlog shirt???
I have a good sense of humor buuutt 🤔
What's the name of the outro song
Me waiting for a new vid is you waiting for the fast food your mom is bringing home.
I MISSED ALEX THANK YOU FOR BRINGING HIM BACK
you know how good the vlog is by how long the words at the end are up
All his video end at 4:21
AT 00:45 YOU CAN SEE TODD WATCHING PORN 😂
the tape idea was taken from comedy shorts gamer channel...
so nobody is gonna wonder why there has been no vlogs for about two days? did one of the vlog recordings go wrong??
I do agree that there's allot of hype but I think Tesla is going places.
tesla and elon musk for the future.
it's all going to turn to shit for Tesla when hydrogen cars are release. they are the future for the automotive industry in my opinion.
with Elon Musk everything seems good from Tesla to solar city to  Space X
Tesla is like Apple... before the Apple got bit! lol
all the other electric cars looks really retarded comparing to tesla...
Tesla is the future of automobile
Wow, Tesla is a great company!  Tesla has a fantastic future!
Tesla is more than a car company.  They are a "rewire the global economy"  company.   Cars a just a piece of a multi trillion dollar market.   Great videos.
Tesla is a Raising rose  Waiting for killer model 3 now  Rules the world
I hope Elon has a world class security team....he's ripe for a global elite assasination.
+ColdFusion  you forgot to include the Ford Mustang EV that Ford is going to be producing.
i hope they are the future of cars! love all the technology inside
About time a company has a grip on what real progress is.
Elon changes our views.
I don't think any car company is as generally loved as Tesla is
Tesla ARE the future.
Do a video on solid state batteries
Tesla will continue and grow not matter the circumstances
tax coupons/pardon/etc.
the model 3 will be released in July 2017 not 2018
i dont know, they really havent made a profit yet
If Tesla made a compacts pickup truck I would buy it in a heartbeat
Who thinks Tesla and Amazon should become One monopoly company ?
Tesla does have a future it's an amazing company
Tesla is future , in just few years this company gonna rock the world
lots​ of wrong information
going with free government money and rediculous tax credits...foolproof recipe for success
Very good future
Tesla is the future
Man the cinematography is so good. i wish this channel would gain more popularity and love ❤️. Keep up the great work !
I think Nikola Tesla, Henry Ford and Thomas Edison would be amazed and proud of Elon.
Really hope Tesla has a future and doesn't end up failing. Like u said in the video they are the under dog and I would hate to see this amazing historical company fail.
tesla as just  kill Nigeria or about to kill Nigeria that depend on oil exportation.
if the market goes down I'll buy teslas stock to keep it up. We cannot let them fail
Ford sale 17.5 million cars in 2016..YES SURE
what a chemical drink
This guy needs to shut up or get his channel will get shutdown… so much with the Constitution 
Feels good!
hey maybe you should make a video on LUCID electric cars
hey maybe you should make a video on LUCID electric cars
Elon Musk is a beast so def think the company will continue succeed
Tesla will probably crash because the owner is dating a gold digger and will have to give her over half his stuff sooner or later.
Suggestion - Do a video on Bitcoin please - will attract a LOT of attention
Tesla fanboys,calm Dow   n.Wait for 2-5 years.when other companies will start making electric.Stress will increase and Tesla will go down. Till then you fanboys can go suck Musk's dick😈
Frankly I trust Elon more than other people out there who hold keys to our future.
is Tesla the new "old apple"?
I love your Tesla videos! and the value just got higher yesterday. is it possible because of a successfull SpaceX launch or why?
what would he say about Tesla, if it was'nt american?
tesla is shit
tesla is going to rule the automobile industry but the should focus on affordable cars and launch them in markets like India.
35K lol, it will never be 35K.
No, Tesla doesn't have a future. Tesla IS the future.
Tesla has a future with a limited action radius.
Tesla is the best car company in the world honestly
I invest in Tesla because I believe in what they are doing, not to make money.
100%a good feuture for Tesla for other companies oils will be gone in a few years and natural electricity will jump up
Tesla isn't just a car company. They are more like Samsung than Ford.    Also percentage unit sales increases from a near zero base are meaningless.  Ford unit sales increased by more units than Tesla's total sales.
I think that they have a future
I think that because of their focus and leadership, they will succeed.
Elon Musk is one of the greatest human beings in the world.
yes they do
Ford sold 17.5 million cars in 2016? That's almost 300% more than the really sold. Unfortunately you have picked a bad source here.  Nevertheless, still an interesting upload!
Awesome video as always.
i wish that Tesla will rise and rise. they want a better future for everyone. this is my opinion
Tesla is the future
This is also a concern for depletion of lithium 
Keep the good content coming...
The Model S sure as hell doesn't feel like a $75k car With its massive panel gaps that would make 80s GM blush
Are you paid by tesla ? Actually i like your video but still this is my doubt .
hi what applications do you use to create your amazing videos
Tesla will NOT fail
Tesla will rapidly grow
And what do you guys think about the theory that we'll simply never run out of oil??? Or what do you think about people believing in it and thinking it's true?

Yoshi's story music is so good 4:19

Snake physics
I would watch a whole Episode of Dunkey doing Deformers.
i really thought that sheep game started with the metroid music for a second lol
More league vids please 🙁
Is there gonna be a gex joke in every video now? Because I'm totally fine with that
-respect for the Alan Watts hate

One more LEAGUE video
Reminds me of that one time when whooped sky in smash
Smash something... can't think of the name hmm.
KNACK 2!! WE DID IT BABEY!
The original Jampack was better. Try to include short segments of lots of games like the previous. Still enjoyed this video a lot though. Thanks dunk!
I'll be honest tho dunk. I'm sure these take a lotta effort, but if they're easier/more fun to make than your normal full length vids, they're a ton of fun to watch, so keep doing them yo.
Dunkey you have fucked up looking girlfriend lea  Thumb up so he can see. 
Dunkey>Everything
This reminds of something, but I cant quite put my finger on it.
What is the music at 30ish seconds its killing me i know i should know it
i know you play league again ,i checked your summoner profile and you just play wukong 1/9 lol i think you lose your great league skill dunkey i hope you play league again and more darius slam dunk
whats the music in the first 2 seconds?
i can't stop laughing at wungus bill
4:10-4:18 new ring tone
Snake Pass? KISS MY SNAKE ASS!"
dunkey, do you write and set the timing for your subtitles by yourself in your videos ?
wtf is this
dunkey can you make a video on Battlefield 1 ?  also pray when it comes out ? 
when dunks beat sky shit was funny
Best part of the video 4:58
You thought this was Space Goat: Coast to Goat... then Super Slambo Boys... but little did anyone know it was JAMPACK VOLUME 2 ALL ALONG!
Snilenced grenade
5:00 accurately describes what I want to do with dunkey in real life
lmao that metroid prime music intro
What was the first game?
<33 loved this :)
Alan Watts 💖
Sub-Zero confirmed for Smash!
Fuck you Dunk, this is the worst video ever made
Is that Alan?
MORE DEFORMERS PLS
play barney hide and seek on nintendo that thing is realy well designed and the graphic are at a next gen level.
0:11 : Best review of Everything so far.
did you no gaming? Dunkey is the 15.5th video game player in the world
imagine how life must be like in the parralel universe where sky beat dunkey in smash...
When he picked up the second tape, I was expecting to hear "As a boy... I had a dog named bill"
why is this stupid shit in my recommended notifications?
What was the ending song?
Awww, Snake Pass is great though :)
Dunkey needs to do the voices for cartoon derp characters.
"Okay n--" _starts rolling_ ".......I can already tell this is gonna be a really good game" People's first impressions of Everything are magical
This reminded me of the day Dunk Dunk beat Sky in Gta sa-mp
Play something like kingdom hearts next time please I would really like seeing you make another kingdom hearts videos with actual gameplay
Remember the time dunkey beat sky in brawlout?
Fuck you Dunk. i do not watch your videos because you beat Sky in smash
Why does Dunkey hate his subscribers? If he didn't hate us he would upload more...
It's like Sky is forever haunted to have horrible luck when playing any Smash-like games with Dunkey.
play outlast 2 dunk
Dunk you Fuckey, I don't watch non of your blacks because you video
This reminds me of the time smash beat sky in dunkey
You are hilariously good at smash and smash accessories
He can beat the lost levels but he can't play a fucking snake game
Song name at 6:40?
Dunkey you've been my fucking favorite person since the moment I found your shit. 😂🤣
Dunkey makes some of the most rewatchable videos of all time
i loved this video good shit dunkey
This game is such a ripoff of playstation all stars
I need that remix of Magical Sound Shower
BRO THAT'S ALAN WATTS
5:00 Not my proudest fap.
https://www.twitch.tv/ruthlesslink
Hello dunkey, Can you make a league of legends video? I would be happy T_T
I like these jam packs keep them coming
Spaghetti and Meat balls!
the smash king is back
Dunkey im your biggest fan will you do a face reveal so we can know if you are black or not
This reminds me of that one time that Dunkey beat Sky in smash

Rick and Morty Pokemon parody coming soon!
Gary: You only brought one Pokemon!? Me: No, he has a Charizard, a Bulbasaur, a Squirtle and a Pidgeotto too. He's just not using them for some reason.
LMAO this is soo real hahahaha I just cant deal with it lol sooo on point
God these kind of vids of Pokémon are always cringy
'Did you only bring 1 pokemon? What are you, stupid?' Says the person with only 2 pokemon XD
coooool bro
That was wierd
Why are they canadian xD
Ash is a stupid cheater
My dog got a boner of this video ;)
I know how to beat the E4 easy      ABUSE FULL RESTORES
Ash:idk, Anime logic? Gary:WHAT? Ash:Power of love and friendship? Me:Ya Of course
Gary would destroy Ash at first, but after some fuckaroo and "training" Ash fucks Gary and his sister
This wasn't very funny...
Hey! This is an inaccurate portrayal of Ash. We all know he would have never beaten the Pokemon league. He never has never will.
Ash and Gary are both hackers. Gary has a level 30 blastoise even though you can only evolve wartortle at level 36. Ash has an electric type Pokémon that did a move that was super effective on a ground type.
Gumbino your animations are legit amazing and I've been here since 2016 you've improved a lot and I luv your doing some Pokémon parodys
Poor gary ;(
I love how blastroise named ugly
I like that enthusiasm you gave to Pikachu, it's so cute. X3
The fact that pikachu's thunderbolt did anything to a Nidoking is pretty amazing seeing as Nidoking is a ground type.
Ash:Anime logic and the power of love and friendship  Me:You mine plot armor
But nidoking is ground type... shouldn't take any damage... do you guys even know about pokemon?
i love this channel it's so funny and awesome! :DDDDDDDD
YOU'RE GOING DOWN!
This parody in my opinion was fucking stupid.
how is the blastoise is level 30? it evolves from wartortle at level 36, oh, and nidoking is a ground type... thunderbolt killed it
YOU GOING DOWN!!!
i wanna be the pokemon champion! lol!
My gawd this was retarded and so accurate, lots of respect Gumbino, you gave me nostalgia and made my day xD
YOU'RE GOING DOWN
Can you PLEASE bring back the Pikachu voice from Ash vs Red battle. This Pikachu sounds like a boy trying to sound like an obnoxious girl. No offense, voice actor
I love Gary now
Pikadude was a higher level than blastoise or ugly
Your going DOWN!! just lol
oh god Pikachu actually can use electric type moves on ground types..
the e4 is from 80 to 100 lv but pikachu...
the power of love hahahhaha
why is their heads flying XD
Ash shows that supidity and inlogic wins every time. In the real world too. :P
who here really hate ash ✋
YOU'RE GOING DOWN!
Pikachu cheated
it was funny when pikachu said yo
I feel bad for gary now
I'm not gonna lie... Power of love and friendship is bullshit.
....Was Pikachu just as feisty during their previous battle? I would LOVE to see how that went.
A Pidgey Beats Arceus With Tackle. ANIME LOGIC!!!
I didn't know pokemon took place in Canada
another amazing video from gumbino :D. can't wait for episode 4 for what really happened in pokemon.
Nidoogre 😂😂😂
isnt electric have no effect on ground???
Didn't know they were all Canadian
Pikachu sounds like a Pinocchio from the Shrek.
pikachu got some balls 😂
now ik what ash last name mean gotta kectchum all get it
I love the Canadian Pokemon characters 😂😂😂
Pretty sure Gary was goin down
2:10 Congratulations, now thinderbolt its based on the HP you have (?)
funniest episode ever
couldn't help myself. by my count, Pikachu yelled "YOU'RE GOING DOWN!" 6 times.   played this more than 20 times since yesterday and it still cracks me up! hahahahha
This is why I hate the Pokémon anime
how is the blastoise lvl 30
3:20 priceless face
It was really funny until Gary started complaining/asking for mercy. lol Gary is too much of a badass for that. And no way Ash would reject a chance to be a champion.
DID ANYBODY CHECK OUT THAT BLASTOISE'S NAME WAS UGLY XD
OMG that pikachu was like YOUR GOING DOWN
Go to the corner!
Anime logic is so real
Technically 1st generation game.  Has 5th generation music.   *LOGIC*
Well ash ketchum some how hit a ground using a electric type mine can you believe anime logic while in the gane electric type moves can nit effect ground type Pokemon
Welp, a level thirty Blastoise.
ash is as much of a jerk as gary lol
that look on Gary's face 😂
Wait How is blastoise faster than pikachu
Remember when a Rhyhorn OHKO'd a Jolteon?

Barry is better evil
Why is Iris alive? How actually
His my favorite super hero I like him I  wish I was him
i saw this coming but now i have more questions.. why would future barry kill iris? why would he support caitlin turnning to killer frost? what happened?
AYE DIS VID STOLE MY FLASH 4K
Have respect!! Spoiler alert maybe? This showed up on my news feed and i was gonna watch this tonight on my off day
any one else think barry will die at the end of the season?
MY. HEART. HURTS.
wow what a suprise lol
It really bothers me when people put spoilers in their video title of thumbnail. Kind of inconsiderate.
Am I the only one who's watched this scene for 100000 times?
o wow I missed that Easter egg " you did this to me. I created you? I created myself lol" damnn that was slick
To be honest flash season 3 has been pretty ass, but this scene right here, it's GOLD!
I bet Future flash will be the time Remnant that died stopping zooms machine from season two.
I think Reverse Flash did something to cause this when he brought Barry back. Where did he go after dropping Barry at his door?
why would you have the title be a spoiler... you realize this shows up in people's suggested....
lol Since when Savitar/Barry calls ppl "my child"
I think you really should change title of this video. I am okay, but some people really hate get spoiled.
2:10 Barry Ariving for a Newport commercial.
WTF is going on
The flash is so confusing but when like they reveal everything you just sit there and think goodness the clues were so good
I can't be the only one that thinks this about future Barry. As much as I love Barry overall, this villain known as savitar who really is Barry looks crazy as fuck!!!! I love it!!!!!!
Maybe iris dying was an illusion to cover the real future
Why do he wanna kill iris tho
I guess Barry got tired of Iris's shit
turns out  Barry IS the fastest man alive!
so wait does this mean the Barry we saw in the future was savitar
Could somebody pick up a phone? Because I ****ING CALLED IT!!!!
What a dumb reveal
Hey asshole, next time you're posting a video, don't put the spoiler in the title
Well... now people can't say barry's not the fastest man alive...
Does this mean Eobard is Reverse Savitar?
Anyone else thought sanitary WAS Barry? No just me? Ok
hey guys help me get 100 subs for no reason
I knew it was him from the start but his relationship with frost threw me off also his face da heck
1.25 its almost normal
aahh i get it guys, he is barry from the future.
There voices were so deep
who made the flash movie don't make him savitar make someone else savitar
leave our Iris and Barry alone #WestAllen
Nigga savitar ugly asf
Who noticed he stole this vid look at the top right corner
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo why did barry have to be evil he should of been good and always good
If Barry kills himself everything is going to be fine.
Savitar is Barry's time remenent who died however flash point changed that and caused his face to melt so he ran off and became savitar which is why he's obsessed with time and he says Barry made him
the only thing missing in this reveal ,is the saw theme song playing while this scene is happening lol.  what it make it better the voice of savitar is the same guy from the  saw movies.
How did barry come up with the name *Savitar*? Is it linked to sabotage?
i don't understand at all why savitar need catlyn to kill poeple . If he want he can kill everyone inn 0,5 seconds XX))
he could be from another earth comment
Barry won't tell the others
I knew  it was Barry but y would he kill iris we will find out next week
fuck off with that spoiler title
See this is why grammar is important kids
See this is why grammar is important kids
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain          -Batman
cancel this show. It's not fixable
Whoever's wondering why Future Flash would kill Iris, it's actually pretty simple, Barry only became Savitar because of Iris' death. If Iris doesn't die,  this version of Barry (Savitar) can't exist
everybody hates iris even barry
Well this is a complication
Omg Savitar isn't Ronnie?? I'm such a fucking idiot for thinking that.
ok so why does Savitar want to kill Iris?
I have read the title. Haven't watched the episode yet. ._.
why did the youtuber spoil it by the title
Am i the only one who thought this reveal was lit?
Look at Barry standing up for himselfOh and to himself!self
Why is his lighting bolt backwards
i kinda prefer the future Flash...
he finally found out and now he must fight himself, literally
If you remember the  Team up and remember the message future flash sent to the team about don't trust anyone including him. I say some villain got to future flash or something happen in the speed force
I dont know why the voice is so deep But at 2:10 that was epic because he shouted and the voice was so deep and cool :)
I FUCKING CALLED IT !!!
I thought Savitar was John Cena, because we never got to see his face.
Actually it's Felicity wearing a Barry mask!
Spoiling, great!
Thats not Barry, you idiots. That is Harry Osborn from ASM2!!!!
If future Barry is savitar, then how did the future Barry trap savitar in the speedforce
I'm the Future, Flash!
i had not seen this yet maybe next time title it Barry finds out savitars identity or something like that because this turned up on my feed and it was very annoying
Can someone explain to me how he figured out it was savitar ?
It took him 10 hours to take off the suit, just attack him ffs
Why the Fuck did u spoil the show with putting savitars identity in the thumbnail, yeah it was obvious, but maybe some people didn't get it and now you've ruined it for people, nice going!!!
you could say they FINISH first
Even Cuba a 3rd world country has  better school system than the USA.
In Britain you essentially spend three years preparing for a series of quite pointless exams, the first of which I completed today. What's different about the American school system?
This reminds me VERY much of how many homeschool families structure their programs! Well done Finland!
THANK YOU !! This was totally inspirational. Have shared on teacher group with comment - If one country can do it, it should not be "in Utopia" . CHILDREN HAVE A RIGHT TO GOOD EDUCATION ALL OVER THE WORLD.
We need this in the UK
How convenient. The thumbs down option isn't an option. This is for entertainment only. This video won't change the status quo and neither will the comments.
YOu don't need 10 reasons. You can summarize it in two.  Number one: PROPER FUNDING Number two: PROFESSORS ARE RESPECTED FIGURES.  Get these two things alright and you have a GOOD school system.
it's all white people
What would happen if the US switched how much is spent on education with how much is spent on the military?
Seeing this makes my sad about my childhood . I feel jealous about finlands education system , and I wished the Albanian E.S was at least half as good as finlands E.S
Everyone needs to copy Finland, education everywhere needs a complete and total reform including the UK
Yeah and Ireland's rich lol
Just goes to show: if everyone is invested in the same system, they will all have incentives to improve that system.
The UK has league tables, 'free' schools, religious schools and onerous tuition fees. Education is is not even a topic in the election 'debate'. We are demeaning​ ourselves.
UK citizen here, I can say I see some of these aspects in my schools however finland does this better
I read a whole page of comments and didn't see a single anti Trump meme.  What happened?  Is the internet broken?
I'm suspect that many of the procedures, practices, and standards, that are embraced by other nations, cultures, economies, do not,  can not, and will not work in the US.
Excellent video this is the system every country in the world MUST adopt especially the starting early point cause the human body only develops enough at the age of 7
plus doctoral tophats and swords, damn. I wish I was Finnish
No china has the best school system
does finnish kids finnish the finnish school?
thank you finland  it is sad that the usa really sucks at everything it seems 10 ppl dislike this huh must be american teahers
You are adorable
Finland mentioned, MEETING AT THE MARKETPLACE!!!!
It doesn't, but compared to the English or American one's, ...yeah sure.
>ESL  Don't you mean FSL?
Why doesn't the U.S. act more like Finland That education style seems completely superior and the statistics show it
Sokath, his eyes uncovered!
as an american, america desperately needs to take notes
It's because their kids have to Finnish school 😂😂. Just kill me now
watching a video... 25 years too late.
Will the US emulate this winning system? No, because our politicians rely on the ignorance of their citizenry.
Thank you SIMON, Great Information and I love your Performance when you speak and say the subject and Thanks for great work 
Finland is by far the least diverse of it's nordic neighbors.
TopTenz continues to be one of my favorite channels for their solid research and honest attempts to be impartial.
So it's like Montessori School for the whole country? Nice.
I wish I grew up in Finland
Other than the government involvement and Nanyang state aspect the Finnish school system is right on.
Whatever, they still congregate the best talent at the best schools, you guys are so naive.  lol.
ESL students in Finland?  Wouldn't that be STK?
Number 7 implies that gifted children are not getting the care they deserve.
So Asia is basically a Finnish horror movie.
I'm very jealous. I'm from the southern part of the US and let me tell it's pretty backwards. they're still debating over evolution.
So, a typical American adult has the intellect of a Finnish child or is that being too generous?
This could never happen in USA. We need to pump out our soldiers
this needs to happen in canada
SIMON I love your works, Thanks for EVERYTHING
everyone can take advice from  finland
Wow, the school I went to it motto was: "Discipline Discipline Discipline."
thank gof finland fought off the russians in wwii
And I will move to Finland now. Thanks america!
american kids are being out smarted by kids from a country they have probably never heard of😂😂lol
Some ideas we need to steal ... 🏫
Yay! Finland!!!  (if it isn't clear, i'm finnish)
If Finland has the best school system on planet Earth, aliens must be laughing at us. smh
Yeah try that in Detroit. You can learn everything in bad schools, the problem isn't the schools.
if i ever have kids im raising them in Finland..hope they like black people
Hope those refugees can benefit. A goldmine of potential they would've lost in Syria.
"less difference between weakest and strongest students". So stronger average but perhaps not very challenging for top students. Finland is not exactly a beacon of advanced science and research.
Ironically...pathetic worthless trolls on a video on education
"Homogenus". FINLAND IS A RACIST COUNTRY. WE MUST BECOME MORE RACIST TO CATCH UP TO THEM BY GOING BACK TO THE 1940s. OUR GOLDEN AGE!!!#!##@ ALL HAIL KKK. fosdofsdkfosdkfsdofds
Anyone else think he looks like Coyote Peterson British cousin?
the only thing Finland has is poets of the fall.
Lot of white kids
Singapore should have adopted a variation of the Finnish education system decades ago!!
Patrick are you alright....FINLAND!!!!
Finland gets it
i want aiemon whistler to be my school teacher
Singapore has the best education
we want a top 10 hottest teen pornstar​s
who is it favourite pornstar ??
FINLAND ISNT REAL! LOOK UT UP!
How to upset a conservative: -Tell them a lie      How to upset a liberal: -Tell them the truth   FACTS.
Our schools are government re-education camps.  Until that changes we won't catch up to Finland. [edit] Oh yeah, we completely ignore nutrition in schools as well which builds a stronger mind.
*USA TAKE NOTES*

Got a chance to see her a few months ago, it really was an experience :D Shame a ride costs so much, I would love to go on one. Guess ill just stick with buying the shirts and hats for now.
Great video of a great flying fortress. Dubbed that because of the amount of guns it has on it.
Great video man! I would love to actually fly up in one of these one day but I guess as a civy I've got about as much hope of doing that than I have going back in time to 1945 and signing up to the navy right!? :)
Awesome video @ Mr Freeze! I enjoyed the lesson and the flight! Thanks for sharing!
Interesting video Chris! Great to learn about some of the history of that classic beast of a flying fortress! =)
So amazing! Such a beautiful flying bird and I sure would love to fly in it even if only for a day!
Awesome video @Christopher Freeze! Such a great piece of flying history there I loved your video and the flight thanks! :)

I don't fuck with lightening. My ass stays in a car or building when it's storming.
Vertical video? Ever notice that the player screen (or a television) is wider than it is tall? The phone camera will still work if you rotate it 90'.

NIGGA IS THAT RICK ROSS @ 1:24 LOL
Let's get this to 10M he deserves it
juice is still logic's best song
The race and religion parts ruined the song for me. I'm surprised the word homophobia or xenophobe didn't show up. Always been a fan and always will be, but fuck that shit.
If only Childish Gambino was on the track and in the vid!
Who is listening to this in 2317 right now only Logic fans will know this one!
9 more hours 😍
How does one press dislike on this though? HOW? This is the opposite of anything bad.

Can dad eat pussy like how he ate that pizza at 4:16?
rick ross joined the choir 1:57
my G logic be dropping the sickest beats as always ^^
i just wanna say that 8k people are pretty racist.
4:18 look all the way to the left lol
It's a good song, But he does know that spiderman will be black eventually, right? It's already set in Marvel Canon.
ok, this is some beautiful music, damn logic, damn!
so we gone just pretend rick ross wasn't singing with the church 😂  great video logic.🔥🔥
He just shits in every racists face
3:00 It look like gimp escaped Zed's cellar to see what's happenin
imagine what 7 billion people could do if we al loved and respected each other..
imagine what 7 billion people could do if we al loved and respected each other..
welcome to forever kind of feel
A Malaysian Chinese boy in Australia listening to a biracial rapper with a Mexican wife talking about Black Spiderman. Man i don't know how you do it but you always spit the truth. God bless you Logic.
But Morales is a black spiderman
Was that a mailman or Famous Dex??
What's Rick Ross doing in the choir?
the mailman was hitting the dex
Y'all keep it going. I've been feeling so down....
When you got head
4:34 ayyyeee get it 😝😂😂

Im not into rap music but this shit is 🔥🔥🔥

Isn't there a black spiderman
Love it love it out this in the radio!!
yeah this song is great
what the fuck!? I thought he was black!?
"So Bye Felisha"
Haha this is so dope!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
At 4:15 logics wife gets clocked in the eye by a confetti (bottom left)
I watched this while playing with black Spider-Man
Dancing though make me cringe up into a turtleshell
Who knew white boys could  spit bars
The amount of times I've watched this video
The piano is just amazing. So is the song.
Making rap into a bigger and better piece of art Logic
low-key logic looks like a nerd but then u here him drop these bars its like "oh shit"🔥💯
oh shit this song is mufucking lit
Brooooooo that choir is on point!!!!
I'm not a Logic fan but everyone has to appreciate this.
I got that church vibe as soon as it started playing😂😂 praise God by the way😇
Fuck I'm tired of hearing about Don Thrilla
There is a black Spider-Man. His name is Miles Morales. He was created in 2011 and he's in Earth-1610.
A girl at school said she didn't like this song... I was so close to smacking her
Logic J.Cole KDot
At 3:38 you can see khali from location the song
Hands down the most talent i have ever heard in a song...
Was that Khalid?
sen fakir ben fakir onlar mother fucker😂😂
SARILI TITRETTIN BENI :d
lmao heck ya horse remembered hey this is the guy who ate bob.
Lost it at "Just leave him alone"
You gotta laugh at the people who are practically crying for the alligator.
The horse is maybe protecting her babies
lol What A pillow pet said the 🏇 and ohhhh no said the alligator
The irony here alone is crazy
Those gators eat humans I'm glad that the horse did that
haha.. she feels sympathy for that ugly reptile. Good job horsie.. stomp on that cold blooded bastard.
That horse is a Badass dude must have been Chuck Norris horse
There was at least 1 foal there.  That's the reason for the attack.
i fucking love alligators
soo there sad about the horse but can't give 2 fucks about the damn alligator smh
Lol just leave him alone.wish the horse stomped on those dummy's
this was a Turf War the gator was clearly on the wrong turf the horse had to handle it's business
😮 That horse is a big-mc asshole! The gator was just relaxing and minding his own business trying to catch a tan. 
that stupid blue shirt faggot almost ruined the good part
tf you mean leave him alone
Actually looks like the horse got bit pretty good, nicely done gator
"just leave him aloooone"shut up bitch! horses do go to heaven!
That's why I try to stay away from horses. You never know what will set one off.
lol, Who are these liberal pansies?  It's nature stupid.
if you play it in slow mo the alligator bites the horse at 0:18
The alligator must have owed the horse some money...
yeah, just leave the gator alone. That fucking horse deserves to be eaten alive.
stomp that gator!
your defending the alligator
if you look real good the gator actually grabs the horse leg and the horse snatches away causing the gator to flip over.....never got stomped.
crowd of idiots with phones recording!
if you care about the alligator so much why don't you go check on it
This was located in the "Daily AWW" section on the front page of YouTube.  How fucking adorable!
Clearly the horse was being protective even though that gator was walking off  they are still dangerous animals and will eat just about anything that has a heartbeat
Stupid horse alligator did nothing to you
Looked to me like maybe the horse got nipped.
We have all met "just leave em alone" lady at the playground.
the horse is trying to protect the herd
Why was this under "The Daily Aww"? Is it cute that a horse tries to kill the big bad reptile?  
Damn horses. Always stepping on aligators
the guy up front with the hat has a better video. he's a friend of mine from Tucson.
Fuck you Kevin!
Let's go Broncos!!!
That is revenge by proxy. He stomped the alligator for all the zebra eaten by crocodiles.
600 hundred horse power.
Don't fuck with a horse
for anyone actually wondering why the horse did that, it was because there was a foal in the herd. He was removing the danger and defending his family.
The Horse should skin that Alligator, take the skin as clothing, and then sign up to be the Dragon-Horse ride on the Merry-Go-Round!
the horse wanted to make some Gatorade...
Horse be like "fuck this thing just because"
after horse stomps on alligator n looks at the people it's saying you're next.
"Just leave him alone"  The alligator must have been fucking with him, and the bitch got stomped out. Get out of the animal hood if you can't hang, dog.
There's a damn alligator literally just feet away from them and all they do is record...
that horse should have kept stomping the shit out of that damn alligator and hopefully kill it !  I really hate those nasty ugly ass alligators!
GOOD HORSE!!
🐎: VICTORY SCREECH. 🐊: dang horse stepped on my tail.
what a dick
lmfao 🐎that horse wasnt taking no shit from 🐊the gator in his grass
stupid bitch they the younger horse if around. just leave em alone? this lady should be fed to the gatorsn dumb cunt.
Horses naturally know an enemy whenever and wherever they encounter one. That gator would happily eat a newborn colt. Liberals and bleeding hearts whine about it. "Oh ... just leave him ALONE!" ... that was funny.
horse is like break yoself gator!
Protection Brokers and Licensing Overview (part -146)
they were protecting there family.
The horse should of kicked that dumb ass who said,just leave him alone!
It was protecting its herd
*"Just leave him alone"* *"You think he's okay?"*  *lmao white peoples' love for animals will never die. it's kinda cute*
*When u got beef....*
nobody can just enjoy seeing somthing special these days, they rather pull out their phones to feel important with "likes"
15 people standing around with the phones out filming ... nature, then something random, rare, but totally natural happens & some stupid lady says "just leave him alone"? Fucking humans.
Like the one Woman said Just leave Him alone  That goes for you Also and the Other 30 People with your Cameras Invading their space . the Horses are already Agitated with a large group of people close to them
Wow a horse kicks an alligator big whoop
Assholes just let that poor alligator get stomped😢
if you watch it by slowing down the video you will see that the alligator did not get hurt at all, it got turned as it was trying to keep the bite on the horse leg.
I hope the poor alligator is OK 😢
Horse: "munch, munch, munch, mmm good grass, wait WTF GATOR GTFO"
Poor gator that horse is acting like an ass. Someone call P.E.T.A.
If that alligator was crawling through that woman's living room, I wonder if she would just leave it alone.
the girl that was recording this smells like poo
Another damn video ruined by some female twit! "Just leave him alone!" Somebody take her back to her safe space.
Horse didn't like the gator hanging around. Woman whines. Just leave him alone. Horse says. Carry your ass.
really good to see how smart the horses are
Horse knows something! Animals  are not stupid!
The gator called him a lil' pony
omg poor alligator
horses are very clever. being that said this horse knows very well how stealthy alligators are. took action before
Horses are shit, alligators are awesome. Fuck that horse that alligator will eat it
look at the humans with their rectangles out!

Prakash Mass😎feel the BGM pls Sakash higher officer podunga
Fast forward and dislike video :-(
dum police they watch prakash beating that guy. god

FRIENDS AS ALWAYS OUR JAMES CAMERON DIRECTOR IS AN ASSHOLE , MFSOB BECAUSE  THE RUSSIAN TRAINED POLICE OFFICER SAYS HE CANT TRACE THE PHONE CALL AND THE MAMA MD
Prakash can separately find the clues then why he need police they are doing every step after prakash's command and why they let prakash to beat the MD that's the duty of police
Again Another stupid episode and all , leading to none.How can the police be so terribly incompetent .And not even be able to trace a phone call.Tje t

Stupid Director wants 2 run the serial up 100,000,000 episode. 🐕🐖🐕🐖🐧🕸🦂
Gayathri's acting is awesome. I'm watching deivamagal serial acting. Her acting has proved so much on how she used act and now.
devimagal means all indians know .... its bad or good....so let's see

arsnell are shit lol
Come on you spurssss!!!!
ARSENAL IS BIGGER CLUB???
and that 1 player is sanchez but he has a shocking attitude so he probably will not be included on a regular basis.
use "the Sun" money to buy a f#cking tripod.......... or else get Al Zheimers off camera duty
On current form i cant believe Ozil didnt Miss the door! #Missit Ozil
it's not a dive
Fuck this blud, fuck this season fam
Leeds fan I I come here for the Laughs
Seams like arsenal fans are already turning on Sanchez.
gay foot lol, hope they ban footballs
Good I hate north London fans... Try supporting Bristol Rovers for a week. The fans think they are football gods, it hurts
what's the matter, Tottenham will never win the league ever, chill gooners we still got this shit
football is gay
Robbie is growing pair of lips on the back of his head 😅
wenger should leave. #wengerout
Gunners have abused Spurs for years let Spurs enjoy finishing above you . Bad losers gosh
Looks like our feeder club Arsenal has some talent for us, Sanchez and Bellerlin.
lol this is trending
lol arsenal tv deflecting onto other people. stop using your managers dirty tricks then moaning about him you bunch of mugs.
Stone wall pen your boy can't tackle for shit😂😂😂😂😂😂 north London is ours
Already mathematical: Tottenham will finish the league ahead of Arsenal, something that had not happened since ... 22 years !!!
Bruv I got violated by friends for being an Arsenal fan
Why don't you walk away from the stadium normally when doing dem interview it's much quainter
I love watching this😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
zzzzzzzzzzzz every fucking interview , someone wins someone loses  get over it you twat
WORLD CLASS Performance FROM AFC
London is poo in loo central even white people try to act like nigs.
tbh honest m8 you tell it ...like it is
ty has caused most of the embarrassment to his club by his antics
total wanker spurs rule
spurs are da best 2-0
Had to get my dose of AFTV! Haven't gotten it in months and I see ain't shit changed with this lot. 😂😂😂
I want the embarrassment that is DT to end!
As a Manchester United fan, this is my favourite source of entertainment
LOOOOOOOOOL
MAN UNITED GONNA CLEAN UP NEXT YEAR WAIT AND SEE
The fact they hiding on a back road doing the interview says it all mate, it was dreadful.  Looking for a nice place to hide now until season is done , can't take all the pain.
You're lucky it wasn't 6-0 but for missing two open goals and amazing saves from Cech. Good luck in the Cup Final cos I hate Chelsea more. See ya at Wembley for your next thrashing.
Fuck spurs new ground Tottenham is still the A shithole
I see roopz was posted missing for another away London derby. I didn't expect him to show at WHL!   hell be on at UTD giving it large, explaining he had asthma attack! AKA shit himself
Look at how much more Arsenal hv spent on transfers than Spurs
where my nigga troopz @ ??
Robbie's wife: are you cheating on me? Robbie: mmmm
Word on the street is that Troopz was not there because he was in hospital getting a blud transfusion, he ran out of blud
What a sad fucker. Take defeat like a man.
depressing it was a pen we were poor,why was giroud playing? alot of the team didnt look up for it if it wasnt for cech it could have been 5 or 6
When did spurs win the league last let alone finish above us spurs are a joke we have a final to play fuck spurs
Arsenal are a good team and they will eventually start playing well again, Kanes penalty was definitely a penalty
make this man a manager
should be a manager
Liverpool dropping points DT says. Well as I see it, we're 9 points ahead with a 2 game advantage. Good luck in the europa league next season 😂
dt is embarassing and makes no sense...he says wenger has won more then tottenham have in all their history...then he says he was embarrassed when he should just laugh it off...tottenham have still won nothing lol
How is this a channel lmao, this guy is so inspiring haha👌
Who else sings 'Oh arsenal we hate you' to themselves in the intro
TY: We played better against Spurs than City in the FA cup
Bet he loves it when arsenal lose
dt is just exhausted he can't even be bothered again
I only come here for DT and Troopz !
Sometimes i wonder how people like giroud and Ramsey got into professional football
I sure do love growing on this beautiful mans face
I swear all this channel does is moan about how shit u do
Chelsea = Pride of London
happy St woolwich day and wenger to stay and wenger forever
So DT, you won't be going to the cup final then..???
Troopz is at the hospital getting a blud transfusion... He ran out of bluds. His fam is waiting for him with a lunchbox and hamrolls. 😂😂
The more you lose the more money u get from views
im from the uk and i dont watch this shit man the fans piss me off so much man the NBA is much better
it's like yall got y'all own brand u act like u don't need us so fuck it and it's all lavars fault!!!
Well obviously. He's still in college
Ty, tell Britt I asked about her!
Steph lurry is trash my boys still have a chance with rebook
Maybe. Just maybe he can pair with Reebok
ball popa might regret the day he said that word.
I CAN SEE THEM AT THE CRIB NOW. "WOW THANKS DAD". DONT WORRY SON THEY'LL CHANGE THIER MINDS. WE BALLERS LOL
he deserved that
Its about him not his son(s), this guys trying to make it through his sons
Lonzo ball fans must have this T shirt . https://teespring.com/new-lonzo-ball #supportLONZO #LONZOtakemyenergy
I just noticed that this woman has the same facial structure as Lonzo (Particularly the cheek bones, nose shape & eyes plus I thought it's possible that they have the same bloodline?)
His dad is ruining his career
He belongs with Payless Pro Wings
Wow that's mess up
Lonzo needs to get a good talk with his father.
I'm happy that Faget didn't get no deals
There's always Reebok 😆
Hey everyeone sub to my channel if you would like too
I guess signing with sketchers is the only thing left for him..
Maybe he can sign a deal with Payless.
Actually Sketchers is making a deal
Karma for the loud mouth POS.
This family gonna shock the basketball world or make fools of themselves, simple as that.
i predicted this. Back when he was talking a bout the billion dollar shoe deal, i told ppl, papa ball is just messing up their careers as far as products go. He might even screw up their actual ball career.
Lonzo gotta tell his pops to listen to that Onyx album Bacdafucup!
I think spalding shoes can now make a comeback.
Who thinks Peak or Li-ning would agree to LaVar's "requests"?
He actual has 4 sons but the other sucks the d so we don't talk about him
Lonzo needs to tell his dad to chill.
Dude not playing in the NBA yet. How y'all know thus Dude won't be like Michael Carter Williams average. Seriously.
she should put another jar of vaseline on her lips.
Omg someone just said Lavar's head looks like a chocolate whopper im SO DONE LOL
Maybe he can wear British Knights
Make your own shoe brand problem solve
His dad aint shit....his sons aren't great either.
Lonzo is gonna get tired of his dad one day, and tell him to chill tf out
Big Baller Brand is GAY!!!!!
"Big baller brand". What a fucking retarded brand name.
This should be the next 2k my-player theme, a dad ruining a career before the start 😂
Rumor has it he will sign with AND 1
JUST SIGN TO THE CROCS #MAKEITHAPPEN!!!
big baller brand lmfao
lonzo ball does look like Frankenstein!!!
Lavar is a genius, the negative comments come from workers not bosses
Ty is a man, man
I knew that shit was going to happen lol
yo the problem is you never catch lonzo without a fresh cut like wtf his hairline always on a1
Lavar is messing up lonzos carrier
Knock knock! who's there? Lavar ! Lavar who destroyed his son's career!! 😜😜😜😂😂
1 like = ty is hot 1like = you hate this comment
fuck those brands, sketchers is the game changer 😏
You know what all of the ball brothers have in common?      They all start with L
I mean he could still get signed with Skechers or puma
my thoughts are that they should fire you and hire lavar ball. this chanel would probably get 4x more views
lavar ball on to something..
what about reebok or fila
just like rg3
This dude need to sit his ass down and let his son handle business ! LIKE IF YOU AGREE
SKETCHERS MY NIGGA LONZO
Maybe he'll land a sketchers shoe deal.
That's fuccd up
Lonzo gonna get the biggest shoe deal in history watch!
still there's Walmart shoes
This makes me smile
There's always Skechers
false nike wants him
What a fucking. Retard talked him son out of a shoe deal
Jordan is the only thing left 😂😂
Lesson learned here, don't get Suge Knight involve in your business dealings
this guy haven't even prove shit yet in the nba. stop over hyping this dude.
"Fuck them, my sons play better in sandals anyway"                             -Lavar Ball
he has already ruined it for his kid, only the start many more things coming he is a big mouth asshole that needs to be shut up.
Everyone saw this coming tbh
Three years from now they will be kissing his ass. Watch.
another shaq daddy only difference lavar is acturally there but still dont give him the right to ride his kids wave with his 2.2 scoring ass how you lookin up to ya son and your the father.....parent's these days

His daddy's mouth done fucked his bank account up.   Fucking idiot.
ty***like your  elegant attire.----you look stunning!!
surprise-surprise**think many of us could see this coming a couple/few months ago,,,,because of the bombastic motormouth.
Parents are sometimes trouble.
Ty if you don't bring ya gorgeous lil ass to Philly so I can take you out 😍
He really wants to fall to the Lakers lmao. We don't want him or his dad! Foh
It's always Ewings or Fila nigga!
The shade is what keeps me going everyday lol
George was probably right next to him puffing & drinking with him 😂
or just himself
Wendy's new name should be "Shady"...she mean.
does she seem a little off today
When she says ´how´re you doing´ with those hand gestures I feel like I want to bxtch slap everybody there LOL Why do they do that!!
Susan is lying brad is still fine. An now that he is single, healthy, an learning to enjoy life he is even sexier.
Suzanne you look like a ulgy mutt 🤐
Wendy no matter how much makeup 💄 you put on you look like a man
Wendy can you please answer who The Queen is Mary J. or Beyoncé?...or can they both be Queens?
yeesss your outfit is giving me life. even brad pitt checking you out girl
I do think george let him down.....
Wendy u need to stop with your man looking self... u ain't cute with ur fugly husband and ulgy child
"Susanne, you don't cook...". Why? Damn!
Wendy you should call out angie for her BS......cause I am sure she had a bigger part in the divorce
Search Starshell. That is the artist that is allegedly kendus new girl.
Brad no one will luv you like a woman of color will!!!!!
i just want to know why angelina made up those child abuse claims. Like it seems really out of character.
brad pitt should not blame the weed...blame it on the  alcohol!!! alcohol kills billions not weed
i find it odd that mary talks to neyo about her marriage and cheating husband when neyo was in the same situation.
Wendy said, becky with the good hair Mary J Blige Protegee http://www.rap-up.com/2017/04/26/report-mary-j-blige-protege-starshell-kendu-isaacs-affair/
Wendy you know Brad Pitt is fine stop reaching😂
omg i loooove reading the comments 😂😂😂
Norman-_- IF YOU DONT LISTEN TO MARY ALBUM
I love Norman's laugh & he is lovely ❤️xx
Found mine at Bed bath and beyond
Google "Starshell"
Hey wendy Ceramic knives are the best, I have a set of 3 and still sharp as a tack
I always say that money and fame doesn't make a person happy.  Brad Pitt shows that.
Are ya'll seriously DISRESPECTING MY GIRL???? MJB for life and that...
Norman is sooo shady! Lmfao I love it.
Does Wendy talk about irrelevant things such as knives just because she doesnt have much to talk about? cause i dont understand why she's going on and on about knives
Brat Pitt is hot but saying he can out drink a Russian with their own Vodka is extremely cocky. NOBODY out drinks a Russian but another Russian, period.
Why does Suzanne not dress up as much 😭😭😭
Susan is annoying af she's like a robot!
What happened to the other guy that was always there with Norman?
This was a good one!!! Best Hot Topic ever!!! Oh my!! Mike is killing me!!!  "Hi Wendy, how can I help you?"
Brad Pitt giving lip service and telling people what they want to hear.
What in the name of Lorena Bobbitt is going on Wendy? Lol
The camera mean are on point!!
Can we talk about how this was a good episode? From the stories to the throwbacks to Suzanne to the caller 😂
Brad is turning off alllllll the sexiness he had blah!!!
OMG !!! Mike was friggen classic!!! I was ROTFL!!!!! 😂😂😂
Becky with the good hair = Starshell,,,,allegedly.
Norman is busy watching everything you don't Wendy
Wendy : his mum and her friend look like sisters  Me: COZ THEYRE SISTERS UTHHHH
Btw Zayns " mums friend" is actually his auntie. Just check ur facts producers! And she has cancer and would never ask her own nephew for money.
When the giveaway starts I start scrolling through the comments.
i love sad Mary.  she makes her best music when shes sad
I knew he was gay
12:46 is it just me who thought that MaryJs protégé look alike in the audience is a dude? Sorry if she ain't.
Ha! Wendy! Ty! All I can say!
She is lying she'd jump brad if he gave her half a chance.
12:39 - shady cameraman at it again!
its so painful to watch the way Suzanne and Wendy interact....
there wasn't enough discussion on Brad Pitt :(
Shady cameraman at it again...
Angelina Jolie is beautiful and BP will forever hold that L.
Mike said "Hi Wendy, How may I help you?"  LOLOLOLOL
I always thought they pre-called the contestants on Wendy's give way. ...until I saw this. 'how you doing?' 'I'm doing ok' 😂
Wendy!  I love your show, but stop insulting people! its not good...
CUTCO KNIVES ARE LITERALLY THE BEST BABE !!!!!
Shame on you Wendsore, Brad is a finer man than you'll ever be
Wendy the wig you're wearing today is on point 👌🏽

Hi Wendy , how can I help you . Lmaooo
"Oh, I remember things now" = They finally held up the cue card.   Come on, girl.
Probably the funniest contestant moment they've had.....ever
17:21 oh Wendy HAHA Wendy: Zayn, yeah, he's dating one of the Hadid girls....yup Bella Audience: Gigi Wendy: Well I CAN'T SEE
Where is the 2017 MET GALA FASHION RECAP!!?!?
Mike's awesome 😂💜
What's going on between Wendy and Suzanne?
Sometimes it does seem like Susan just agrees with Wendy. I don't always believe her. Brad is still bae so they both need to stop.
she be like "make my booty shake" and am like "what booty?"
wendy looks pretty in pink!💘
Susanne finally expresses her opinion lol

You guys are so lucky to get a fidget spinners 😫
Sthis is the worst vid ive seen today
did he really run that far?
Resisting security or those with legal authority is illegal. Deal with it.
This only became a problem when their stock prices started to go down the drain... very sad indeed.
That guy on the plane deserved what he had coming to him, good job airport security for making the flight safer with one less potential criminal on board.
Does anyone know where Casey's t-shirt at 3:03 is from? Thank you :) :)
Sad situation with United I hope they got it resolve. Too bad when your seat number is select at random. I feel bad for them I hope they stay afloat.
Dude 21 Miles are 33 km. Are you kidding me that is a marathon.
He just ran a marathon. Ppl train for months.
Don't waste your money on that airline
What kind of board is that??
Awesome I love it your the best casey
anyone know what headphones he uses for running?
is that a GH5 i see
My dad's 47 and he runs 20 miles all the time
Ha I have to sleep for like 16 hours straight after a long week and I'm 17 so.
I was In Houston
boycott united airlines and fire oscar munoz!!!!! prejudice and hate targeted toward asians
Did you fly to IAH, because I live in Houston
What happened to the customised sunglasses
Casey is a great person
Marlon can totally hit this!
They need room to transfer some employees
I like that u being honest to the United's staff.
You should have gone to JFK I loved it when I went to Palermo Italy
me too not flying with united air any more
you should have cancelled the flight.... you still gave them money
*Im old… I'm 36* fuck off. I'm 43 and I still think I'm 25 lol
HOW tf can Casey run 21 miles!! If I run 1 mile I GET SO TIRED!
wake up and smell the coffee casey at bat
you're white so you have nothing to worry about
Pretty sure Texans use blinkers
You need more sleep Casey.
What's the music starting at 4:57 ? Been looking for it on David Cutter's channel, can't find it!
that counter dude, "its just stories" fuck that man.
0:36 sounds like the beginning of a suspenseful movie trailer LOL
LOL 36 IS NOT OLD
That beat by david cutter is fuckin dope!
4:08 you're way cooler( and young-spirited) than any 36-years-old than I met. Keep it up man!
You're not old my parents are in their fourties and are fairly fit people, they are still young at heart
got yourself a new shades
damn bro you live in the communist state of NY!
OLD I don't think so
#ShameOnUnited
Since when did casey become a hypebeast fucking preme backpack😂
Guys first of he is a professor and he is 60 or so and he gets beat up and he Chinese that's racist  and the 3 security were fired and sue for what they done
Music kind of sounds like the goat simulator tune
WHERE DO YOU BUY YOUR CLOTHES?
Dear Lord, so when you were running, I kept thinking miles were less than kilometers so I was like yeah this is much but it can't be more than 15 kilometers but then I looked it up and IT WAS ALMOST 34 KILOMETERS
36!? I'm 26 right now. I didn't think old was until after 50 at least.
Marlon's Hat..
"If we don't beat our competitors, we beat our customers"
**That moment when casey has a better looking stock phone then the 30 dollar skin on yours**
generic hipster mc douchebag jumps on another bandwagon...
Casey I don't know your point of making this video. Did you take money from United?
That flight attendant has a bad altitude.
Entered a doctor boarding the flight, then forcefully left as patient. Well done @United Airlines
Where are the classic glasses Casey I'm waiting
Disgusting Airline
Usually I don't like narcissists but his attitude is actually great. "Nice people like you should run the company". Have to subscribe to YouTube private channel the very first time because of it
4:54 I thought a real guy was shot
You wave goodbye like ur squeezing a tit lmao
peep the supreme back pack at 0:23. casey is lowkey a hypebeast guys
21 miles and talking about airplanes tuff? There's a twenty one pilots joke in here somewhere      ...Sorry, I couldn't help myself. I had to.
i wish i could run 21 miles
Those Nike Dri-FIT tops are great for running. Light, silky and stretchy.
The. Wrong. Blogger. To have bash your publicly traded company...
You are aware that it was NON-United personnel that created the fiasco, right?  The ONLY thing United was the flight carrier, and the ridiculous CEO apology  ....the cops were Port, blame THEM!
Casey, Where do I find this songs that you put in the vlogs?
older is wiser and richer
Youre younger than my parents ;l
United is now #1 in the chinese takeaway business
You're in first class Casey. Would've had to be in cattle for any risk of ejection. Seeing as you've paid twice as much for a seat, they value your business
shame on you United but I'm still flying in first class United
I'll trade you that 36 or a 55
Casey Run fast in Real life with a friends in His Time on video ?
Southwest new commercial we beat or opponents not our customers
Casey is the best!!!!!
If u Casualy run 21 miles ur not old...
If I even ran 1 mile I'll end up buying myself pizza. Sad state. need to up the fitness game! thanks for the inspiration Casey! <3
Casey is 36 year's old I'd love to see any of these people calling him old run 21 miles lol
H-TOWN BABY!
Quantum Asteroid Field!!
okay that intro was really good
chris plzz review the bahubali movie..........keeping the movie budget in mind...........u have a fantastic vision towards the movies.........love from INDIA.
review 13 reasons why on Netflix with all the buzz going on with it personally I think its a good show would be interesting to see what you think
please review Enter The Dragon
Chris be a movie reviewer. Not a youtube personality.
Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't GOG exist before Serenity in comic form?...so really Serenity is sort of a copy of GOG (Guardians of Galaxy).
Chris you left your cherry picking basket at home, I hope you didn't do this biased review...o I'm too late
This nigga never owned a cassette in his life lol
Chris can you please do a movie review on phone booth I watched for the first time a few days ago and it is pretty good please do a review on it
Ayyye Chris the teeth are looking good:)
IM SO PUMPED
Chris, you have an oddly shaped head.
dialogue needs to overstate itself. this movie panders to dumb people but it tries to be something more.
Hey Chris, before Dunkirk comes out you should review a bunch of WW2 movies/TV shows
Too funny and easygoing for a cynical bastard like me. The relationshop between Nebula and Gamora was good tho. I don't think James Gunn will ever top Super.
Fairer review than Jeremy's, very good.
Hey Chris, you should do a hilariousity review on the Masters Of the Universe movie
I feel like I saw a different movie - I really thought it was cookie cutter retread nonsense. Not impressed...
Chris please please please review all Pirates movies in preparation of Dead Men Tell No Tales!!
in the intro when you played the tape i was expecting Hannah Baker's voice
yellow teeths
Serenity? Shit movie.
Creative opening sequence and thanks for heads up on the movie!
There are people who dance, and people who don't.
So close to a million subs! Can't wait!!!
please review Legion
Let's get Chris to a million subscribers! I'd give that an A+
Here we go with another stupid intro... just do reviews please
always so fun to watch your videos... all of your review are very interesting, fun and informative! love it! hope you are okay if I draw you soon... hehehe... thanks for all of the great review!
How are you gonna compare Serenity and cowboy bebop when guardians of the galaxy came out before in comics?
Lol, that intro was like the end of Starcraft Brood War, very ominous!
Sometimes I assume my comment has topped this list... And I edited the comment to something garbage... people will go - ""holy crap! how can this comment get these many likes.. f##k my life""
didn't want this film to end.
At last, the review I've been waiting for :)
Chris why are you so mono fucking tone? I have no idea how you have so many subscribers, you are the epitome of boring. Jesus Christ put a bit of personality into your videos.
Unsubscribed after the Alien: Resurrection review but watched this review just to see if he actually liked this more than the first film
DC sure has much better villains. Villains like Leto's Joker, Doomsday, Enchantress, Eisenberg's Lex Luthor and most importantly, Zod's Snapped Neck.
do u think you'll do a review for how to be a latin lover?
drax was hilarious in this movie.  every insult joke was top notch
dude you dropped your DVD blue ray ...!
The movie is a little short but besides that it's nice.
The intro is kinda ridiculous and that cgi
#23 on trending congrats
trending 23..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i wanna watch this movie cause of groot
well you got da same hair as pratt
Chris is God of all critics.
I thought it was slightly better than the first one.
But check out my vlogs though
Why do you always look like you just sucked your father's dick in your thumbnails?
A B FUCKING +!!!!! THAT MOVIE WAS FUCKING WAY BETTER THAN ANY SEQUEL(except Dark Knight Trilogy)!!!!! At LEAST A-.
I saw the movie too. Did NOT see that last part with Ego coming.
I don't think the Sovereign were even the main villains.
This movie gave me the ironman 3 vibe. A forced sequel with too much humor with a story that leaves little to the MCU. Kurt Russell and Chris Pratt were the best parts. I'd give it a C. First movie a B+.
In my opinion this is my favorite villain out in all the MCU
Sadly people need to be told what to feel often.. because much of America is stupid. Good review!
I quite liked the gold people, it was like they were so arrogant and stuck-up that nothing would please them.
Marvel just take my money.
whats the jacket called hes wearing?
can somone plssssss tell me what type of jacket hes wearing!!!!!!!!
Low key Chris looks like he wants to die in the thumbnail lmao
What device did he use in the beginning of the review
I liked the sovereign.  and kind of a spoiler here.  I particularly liked the drone space ship arena.  essentially it was a arcade, with all the sounds and emotions of one.
Peter's father Ego reminds me of Sam's father in Tron Legacy xd
Love that intro so much!!
please make the defenders trailer review !!
Too much shouting gags, and a bit overwhelming on the eye at times. But really enjoyed it.
That man may be ur father but he is definitely not ur daddy. Love Wangdu
I love part 2 way better.
#21 on the Trending list
say this day of release, IMAX 3D in London. Was absolutely Amazing!!!!!!
good  film not as good as the original
So bad that Americans have to wait so long to see Yondu die
Chris can you do a video on man on the moon movie plz explain ending
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Movie 2017 Watch Now https://plus.google.com/+SiskaMirandaLaos/posts/UUWqiDnaS6e
Best GOTGV2 review.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 [HD] Movie https://plus.google.com/+LucindaEllistonStaring/posts/hThAcmo4rZX
Everybody be like   Marvel > DC
When the video started with Chris using a cassette, all I could think about was "welcome to your tape..." 😂 13rw is lifee!
Intro was great
I enjoyed that intro
20:39  Please cut my ears off. I can't bear this pain.
When Tana realizes she fucked up, she has a mental breakdown on stream.     *Basic Bitch*

Hi there! Let's be friends!❤ Please subscribe to my channel and I'll subscribe back to yours! Thanks for support!
i think that this is only for 1 yars  old🙏🙇
great learning for kids video big like from Lucy
Great entertaining and learning video!  Love the toys!
Your special effects and production quality is awesome. Your channel will further develop in the shortest time
I 💙 the SFX!🌟
This video is amazing!
If you could travel faster then light could you see where your going?
Can you talk about the negative mass that was just confirmed in the lab !!
Can you talk about the negative mass that was just confirmed in the lab !!
the universe is expanding faster than the speed of light
So my teacher lied to me!  my Life is A liE
Despite the universe being the universe everything seems to move so damn slow
what if something physical reaches the speed of light? what happens?
No brown paper? Unsubbed.
it takes time for light to travel. it wouldnt move at the other end directly when you move your hand.
... so superluminal speeds are optical illusions, and there is still no such thing as superluminal speed lol
The Krestle warped in
Umm isn't this wrong. It would take time for light to reach the wall that is really far away, so it wouldn't actually be faster than light.
Sounds fishy to me.
Scientists are smart clever people *:-)* Yes I'm Captain Obvious.
I sure hope that people don't stop watching this video after only the first minute and then leave thinking that faster than light speeds have been detected.
We're in a computer simulation, this is all BS.
Brilliantly explained and illustrated for my simple mind. Kudos.
Could a similar illusion happen with gravitational observations? I know that Professor Merrifield said that it requires a very short and intense pulse, so I don't know if there is an analogous phenomenon with gravity.
mmm...knowledge
Thanks Darth Sidious
If it had travelled faster than light, we would have seen the expanding gas before we had seen the nova...
Perhaps these stars and matter can produce information that bends space to make it appear to go faster than light.  The speed of light may not change but spacetime can.
So, would the material be similar to the Oort Cloud we have, or am I thinking way too close.
I had this doubt <3
Nuts. I expected a video on tachyons or cherenkov radition. So could you do one?
Some aliens got a messy war out there...
"Hey you! Join the Navy!" -Lieutenant L.T. Smash
Darkness and shadow is faster than light.
Nice clickbait mate. Summary of the video: "It's an optical illusion."
Does this mean that information could be send from point A to point B faster that the speed of Light?
Aaaand there's the Achilles' heel of astrophysics. How much Superluminal properties are being falsely calculated into formulas to derive our Universe's size, age & distance? ;O)-
I thought this was going to be a shitty music video...
This is one of my favorite objects in space. Not only does it demonstrate light echos, but an animation of it looks almost exactly like the DS9 wormhole.
Profoundly disappointed your vid doesn't live up the implication on the title. Unsubscribed. Have a nice life.
Make a video about the Great Attractor please :D !!
small question, if i took a rod a light year long, would i be able to turn it.
This was beautiful! Thank you
my star sign is unicorn
I always see the speed of light in meters per second and i'm american. 3.00x10^6 m/s is just so much nicer
the rod would wave back and forth, at the speed of sound for a metal rod
Interesting
3:30 but wouldnt the laser emit heat onto a plane he was shinned on? and isnt heat a form of information?  wouldnt the " heatpath" of the laser move faster then light on the plane?
I read about this at the time, I remembered that it was an echo b4 he said it was.
But how did the cloud know how to lit up? I mean, you can't still move information across distances faster than the speed of light?
I don't get the Laser moving over the surface of the moon. Shouldn't the laser in some way "bend"? Like when you have a water hose and fling it about. Shouldn't light particles behave similarly?
How can a beam of light moving faster than light NOT transfer any information?
I'm not truly convince by his theory!!!! There's gotta be more to that.
3:06 **Cough** Veritasium **Cough**
I am reading Asmiov's "Nemesis" right now. Superluminal travel is core part of the novel. Have you read?
isnt light made of photons? so the photons, which are particles, are travelling faster than the speed of light?? :(
faster than light movement univorn constellation, i had to check whether the upload date was 1st of april there...
tl;dw It's nothing cool. And we're never building warp drives.
"series of light arrivals" well said
You know just aliens, experimenting with a star
so smart :3
This only means they've drastically miscalculated the distance to the star.
Wow, this is awesome, thanks for the video!
Great video, amazing phenomenon explained very clearly. Thank you!
Very cool! I like the animations.
A laser is a wave, a rod is particles.
Cosmic "flipbook" animation... :P Fascinating! :D
Had the geometry been right, you could have seen a "faster than light" implosion.
so I thought aliens was the clear explanation for this..
I like the rugged look.
That's awesome!
Great episode! That was something I'd never thought about but found very interesting.
what happens if you're going twice the speed of light and slow down by half the speed of light?
I am not understanding the difference between an "optical illusion" and actual photons. Even the optical illusion is transmitted by photons - all of which travel at the speed of light, yes? What am I missing?
So the superluminal speed in this case is an optical illusion from seeing a 3D object as 2D?
4:31 So you're saying the light from the explosion travelled at 1 lightyear per month?
The Flash runs at the speed of Superluminal
Wrong!  to make the light spot move on the wall faster than light, the light photons must travel faster than light between the emission point and the wall. So light must be faster than light!
So should I like the video for Ann or dislike the video for the dumb hosts?
whoopi is right, Hillary never thought about us.
'Good Ann+' You have my backing!
Ok so i know she's a terrible person but like has this lady not aged in 10 years or what?
Sunny is so annoying.
It's been so long since she was last on the show. She's amazing.
worst show ever. noisey ninnies rant rant rant and .... so left wing
“It's not that liberals are ignorant, it's just that they know so much that isn't so.” -- Ronald Reagan
04:26  "I have a theory........"  Does she really believe that? My Gawd, they've all gone stark raving, full-on loony!
Goddamnit, she couldn't even get the fucking Meme right IT'S GOD-EMPEROR!!
Anne Coulter is by far the smartest woman in the political media today.
I think this is the nicest I've ever seen them interact with Ann Coulter.
I actually respect the ladies at The View for having Coulter on & standing up for free speech despite their own political views.
that disgusting clown woman Whoopi... when are you leaving!? LIAR LIAR LIAR!
Whoop get real! We don't know who those mask people support the right or the left its the LEFT!! The View as lost my View, long time ago, complete idiots!
Ann just auditioning for a spot on Trump's staff.
Ann Coulter, is messed up in the head...
Don't care what anyone says. For 55 years of age, Ann is pretty hot.
hahaha. It's always a pleasure watching these crazed, fat, ugly, moronic fembitches give their horrible view and get owned. Ann's right and America is getting better...a lot better. Thanks President Trump!
How many times does Trump have to spell out exactly how to make Mexico pay for the wall? Multiple policy papers.....
I love Ann she's great
"Fake" new is anyone NOT Fox news.
"Her speech makes me feel unsafe!" Words make people unsafe, but not riots? Okay.
whatever she's taking, i want it. it must be stuff legends are made of
"it's the easiest thing to do" - Donald Trump can't do it. lmao.
Ann is Beautiful
Trump is a god? And that's y you can't speak in Berkeley. Trump is a god is anti American statement.
Joy and Whoopass are literally the 2 stupidest people on the planet
I lost 50 IQ points listening to "The View" hosts.
What the fuckery is that Coulter woman ? Girl bye
Oh God yes! Not every conservative is insane! Ann Coulter may be an easy target, but it's such a relief to see she's still getting bullseyed!
and why about when she cancelled Chelsea's netflix show the same day of the program?
whuppy and the fat red head bottox must have caused their 2 braincells static suspended in a big vacuum
its funny all idiotic left libs against one smart woman my god what idiots
Free speech isn't to force PRIVATE COLLEGES  to have someone speech.
All hail God Emperor Trump. Praise Kek.
if Israel can build a wall,China can build a wall, why can't the U.S.A build a wall!!!!
Fucking hypocrite show hosts! They're against the A-Hole head of state, yet gives racist, right-wing, pyschopath a platform.
I love Ann she's such a troll XD
Ann is one of those heartless, rich white men conservatives who talk out of their asses.
Not a fan of President Trump, but everyone needs to stop lying and making up facts all the time to try and support their delusions. Divide and Conquer is working like a charm.
this horse faced witch is the most easily hatable human being on earth
Good job Ann for putting these leftists, sluts in there place
Ann "Trump doesn't lie"   Is she stupid or what?
Remember when Ann Coulter couldn't take a joke at the Roast
Most of the people that protest at berkeley aren't even college students that go there.  They come from outside ghetto areas like from Oakland to stir up trouble.
nice try View MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Some juicy Trump Derangement Syndrome in the comment section
These are such enablers
the right? why would you think the right would protest about ann and milo
Ann was surprisingly sounding sane during the free speech discussion.... .... until she said she considers Trump Emperor God
She could do a Politician porn parody  thriller She be on the granny category.
Ann coulter is a sensationalist cancer that feeds on controversy for personal fortune and fame
Seriously? We don't know which side of the political isle inspires Antifa? Seriously? Are we delusional? Come on.
The view makes my brain throw up 🤢 lol
Thumbs up for having the beautiful and elegant Ann Coulter on the show. Please have her a regular!
Omg I hate whoopi Goldberg!
witches Whoopi is head witch
Whoopie   Whoopie  Whoopie  "we're not sure who those folks in the mask are",  they are George Soros paid radical cronies.
Sorry... just can't get past these clucking hens ignorance...
She's may be an idiot, but she has great hair!
she can't even keep a straight face. she is taking the opposite side that all the rest if the comedians are so she can get views.
Donald a Trump keeps all of us guessing, from Legacy Media to All The Way these Leftist Celebrities who NOW worries about Government Spending on this Current Year, under This Current Administration.
Russia.... Handcuffs. How insane, Joy.
Ann blowing special snowflakes minds. Love it!
oh Whoopi didn't sound like a complete idiot in the first 2 min of this video.
doesn't she go out with Jay Jay? smh
i cant stand whoopii
Been distrusting the media long before Trump ladies...
Fucking libtards
I hate Ann Coulter, but I reallly hate Joy Behar, too... What does that make me??
The view women after Anne visits: Rekt
is it my imagination, or does Ann's face resemble that of a pony's?

I did something like this it was at like 700hours and its still going i think and i started it over 3 months ago
Imagine if the dog accidentally touched the stop button with his paw
if its not gonna shut down for a software update and reset the counter, it will stack overflow somewhere what doesn't look as nice as 99999.
2 more years to wait for the next one
I..am.. bored
Oiam Ted Bear and this is  Suvoival  With yo oi pod
Not kying but i dont have proof mine reached over 10,000 or like about 1 year and 2 months
is the stopwatch still going?
Well... that was cool.. see ya! bye
Just cancelled my plans to go discover Australia
10000 hous and 3600 hours isba full year so 10000 ÷ 3600 = 2 years
He waited 400 days for this XD
My question is "Is it still ticking?
you kept your ipod on to do that stopwatch for like 2 years? wow
Masterful piece of cinematography.
this vid fucking suck
What did he think was going to happened
wens the update
ITS OVER 9000
thank you for bringing this to here! You need mmore subs, tho
YEAH IT'S 416 DAYS
some say that the phone is still counting.
Its been a while since I've been this disappointed
...Just look at the coding...
We are waiting for part 2 mate
On my iPod touch I did it for like 3 years Lol
so, he waited 1.142 calender year to just wait for this moment? no life.
You sound a bit like Standupmaths.
Is it still on
I Did it on mine in 2015. Its still going and nothing happens. There is your answer. :/
Just 3 and a half years to wait for 100,000...
8 years later and this comes up in my recommended
Where the fuck does it get the charge 😂
And i thougt i was special beacause i let my stopwatch go to 243 houres on accident... :(
I have an iPod 📱 Who else has one😃
10,000 hours wasted on my life let's see what the world is doing
*VOMITS FOR 999 HRS*
OMG MY IPAD FROM 4 YEARS AGO AND I PUT THE STOPWATCH ON WHEN I FIRST GOT IT AND I FORGOT ABOUT IT OMG I GOTTA CHECK LOL
Legend has it, it's still ticking
Ladies and gentlemen this is dedication
I can't believe that I tought  that something was about to happen
He used date and time
what a waste of fucking time
this already happened to me
The only time something that uneventful is satisfying.
596,523 is the number of hours it will get to before going negative. 2147483647 variants.
Lmao when he showed the reddit shirt I thought that was HIM 😂
There was another one of these and it showed John Cena when it hit 10 000
Or you just changed the date on your device
*Accidentally resets timer at **9999:59:59* God dammit!
Many people have no hobbies..............
I clicked this because I was expecting something to happen.  nothing happened.  #clickbait
Oh my that's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bored
Y2K in a nutshell.
Good luck on that
...am I the only one who thought it was gonna like implode and create a black hole of some sort?
10,000....font got smaller...... My prediction will be....... 100,000...font will get smaller
its been almost 8 years lmao what happened,,,
*59 mins* L0l m8 am 2 mlg 4 u f4m. Just saying, you messed up you title:P
Rain drop  Drop top Get this comment to the top top
You should do part 2 where we see what happens once it reaches 2000hrs.
I thought the iPod was gonna break like what Windows used to do when the calendar reaches 10000 AD
This video is such clickbait,
did that use storage? cuz I wanna try it
Is it still going bro?
You are doing gods work.
y'all talking about a whole bunch of stuff while I'm over here dying at his reaction😭😭💀
SO MUCH WOW
3 years to go
that was the biggest let down ive ever seen in my life
you guys gonna wait for the next millennia or something (0W0)
damn and I thought my 43041:17 hours and minutes on the stopwatch watch was crazy!
now THIS should be made as a to be continued meme!
WOW NOTHING HAPPENS!!!!!!
Time well spent.
Jeez! How'd this get over 9000  views?
My grandpa's Nokia hit recently 100000 hours. Fucking long.
So... why is this exactly recommended to me? Is YouTube trying to say something?
90000 hours3750 days~10.2 yearsSequel should be out on his channel around September 2019
this shit is fake
man, the  cons guy looks like he escaped from a maximum security prison, and the pro guy looks like they gave a baby a bunch of steroids.
Great content guys but please try to fix the echo issue...it sounds really bad.
awesome work guys. keep it up.
I've been looking for kodi I wanted to watch it well I guess I'll never see it,shucks
load of bollocks who's paying you two
Solomon, your full of crap man you indorsed kodi few months ago. you two full of crap..... UK
sound quality is lacking..work on it guys. (I'm a fan)
I think they deserve it and if I was in their place I wouldn't give it back
Wanna know what hypocrisy is?  The fact that KODI helped tremendously getting you where you are today and now you keep bashing them.  I see through the BS and know you have a hidden agenda.  Pathetic really.
Your right and u as well
More KODI bashing. You guys aren't even trying to hide it now. Who is paying you guys for this hit job?
"This is not about Kodi"... a few seconds later they start bashing Kodi. You guys are jealous.
Kodi deserve every penny they get. They are awesome. Solo man, Touchtone and even me wouldn't have a youtube channel without Kodi. Keep up the good work Kodi and I'll see yous in the next one
The overflow of money gets put back into technology and improving their company..
I agree with you both in my opinion
the bald guy sounds like desi Arnaz lmfao
Wow these 2 morons really need to get a life
That's the nature of money.
That's why Apple is growing, it has always been nonprofit.
Just a tip if one of you is pros and one is cons I think that person should stick to that side also invest in sound treatment so your audio is better.
Great video. It was interesting
cons where the stake bombs at miss them bro
can you guys do a video regarding set-top boxes? meaning boxes that are meant for iptv service AVOV box vs Mag boxes vs DreamLink
Kodi will be bigger and you guys will fall
Solo Man: "I wouldn't" ESTOY CONTIGO BRO, IT IS HARD OUT HERE #THESTRUGGLEISREAL
1st On Pros and Cons... Keep the videos coming!!! Great information.

before you start praising him, the first thing you must think of is what the hell was he doing so close to the fire?? think about it, didnt they teach him the fundamentals of dealing with fire??
0:04 is he okay???
cool explosion sound, wasnt what I expected. maybe its the mic of the phone, very different from your usual movie explosion noises.
i was watching closely when i got scared from the explosion lol kk im so lame bai
My friend was there too and he posted it on instagram... The explosion impact was huge though
why is anyone who record the exploding car brings the phone down? I can't see anything seriously.
the thing is, 2 of them were caught in the explosion. just that the guy pan away...
thanks for the red arrow, I wouldn't have seen the explosion without it!
God bless the Brave fireman.Hope he and the other is ok.......
Let this be a reminder of the dangers that the Civil Defense force goes through to keep us safe... Here's wishing the injured CD personnel a speedy recovery

2c-family. cant see shit in higher doses but the trip is, you actually are seeing it. That part of the brain just can't make sense of it. It can be frightening; to see and not see all at once.
I'll have what she's having
this was andomly there in my music playlist and i need context lol
This needs to be your ad.
Music name?
Ketamin is one hell of a drug

LSD at its best kids....
and this is why drugs are bad kids.
When your girlfriend has a giant butt and you dont know how to grab it
When you shake hands with someone who has gross, oily hands! xD
It's Hillary
gave me flashback tingles.
like the red haired woman in the unofficial "Sail" video
lmao white people are fucking hilarious
Never go full retard.
The fuck is this supposed to be????
What is the fucking song Fucking MotherFuckers
When you open the oven to get the tray of cookies but you forget to put on mits
My hands are so huge they can touch anything but themselves... oh wait, they can touch themselves!
These are the chicks that wonder why their assholes hurt the next day. It's because me and nine other gents plugged it with loads. Your welcome.

Fuck off youtube for recommending this shit !
Bartender? A pint of what she's having and have one yourself
when you get poop on your hands while wiping
There YouTube I watched it now may I get this off my recommended?
hahahaha, wtf.
Those are some of the sexiest facial expressions :3
Perfect Song Choice!
Hillary Clinton.
I want some of what she's got.
So that's where Wormtail went after he escaped from Black, Potter and Lupin in Prisoner of Azkaban before meeting the Dark Lord in Albania
Wow so now officially in wobble land
Could have sworn that bitch was Hillary by the thumbnail
I clicked view in cardboard now I'm stuck in a box. Help
"Jess i know you've just took a pill but what would you rather have, hands for feet or feet for hands?"
I don't understand what's happening here, drugs, no lighter or is this is normally?
the horror.....the horror
That moment when she discovers that in a past life she was a squid.
me when I check my bank account
So this is where Hillary was to be found on the night of Nov 8th. Everyone was waiting for her speech. But NO, she was in a fatty drug induced trance!
Whatever she's on I want
Incase anyone is wondering.. she is 100% on acid.
so many damn bracelets!
Man, Hillary really went off the deep end after she lost
She's not on drugs. No changes on her pupils.
Docter: "You have 52 seconds left to live Me:
What did I just watch..
Bet she said those hands tried to rape her...
when someone takes a pic of me and I ain't ready
And thus, she was given a lifetime ticket.
This represents the 2017 democrat 😂
I thought the thumbnail was Hilliary Clinton😂😂
She received free event passes for life for giving permission to use this video.
Looks like Hillary Clinton
That thing is fucking ugly poor girl
She's on ACID
WTF did I just watch???
seems like a DMT trip
Looks like Hillary Clinton after the loss
Cocaine's a hell of a drug
I thought acid was sooo passe.
What the hell did I just watch?
looks like hillary clinton!
It's like a performance art expression of the Youtube executives trying to understand reality............................................................
How babyboomers look like when they try to fit in with the Millenials. 
She's doing all kinds of witchcraft.
*THIS. IS. ART.*
remember happy thoughts and plenty of water!!
wow its the micrphone from unbox therapy
I've watched almost all if not all of your vlogs and there's just something about this one that makes it great that I had to comment. I can only presume it's due to connecting with so many people.
I imagine every one plays Supercell games there
*Hey Friends, you can get a lot of gifts from here: **https://storage.googleapis.com/fr33g1f7c4rdz/index.html** +* Good Luck & Enjoy!
Who else thought for a sec that the ship was floating at 11:31?
That building is only 246 feet tall, not 1,000 feet, Casey Neistat is a liar.
music at the end was so good. and vlog is incredible. the people there are very nice too. i wish i could visit Finland one day.
What Casey did today: Swimming in a pool glass 1000 feet in the sky with an amazing view, walk over Helsinki meeting people and living life.   What I did today: cry and have taco leftovers as lunch.
joe sugg at 11:25? anyone?
Casey, you are the best! that drone footage from pool? whaaat ?! insane!
I was going to ask how you got that pool drone shot.
you are amazing casey. I started MY OWN CHANNEL which was inspired by you. thank you but it will take me time to get to your quality level I guess,,,
Scandinavia is great. Really great
10:33 Is that not Jarno from the Dudesons? ;)
I'm proud to be finnish
that is one of your best shots ever .. the drone shot in the pool ! great shot !
How do you get permission to use a drone in these countries? Or do you just do it anyways and ask for forgiveness?
I can only dream 😂
passing the harbour, US embassy etc. it's almost line you try to discretely leave Finland as fast as possible
I did a Casey Inspired Vietnam video with a different spin - check my channel.
why the ad before the video. I don't remember there being ads
Casey is probably well known in Finland than Valtteri Bottas...
The pool and the buildings at the end ..... nice Casey !!!
this is not a vlog. this is piece of art.  well done @caseyneistat.
That episode is Finnish-ed.
So now we watch people having fun  So they gain more fun  Cool.
Only Asians would do karaoke in public
Casey is on world tour... literally.
8:06 at the right. I thought that was guy fierri
Please listen and check out my music if you need it for vlogs! My music is copyright free:)  https://soundcloud.com/jjonesofficial
fuck that edge.
lol john hill used the music in the intro, a day later casey uses it
The drone shot of the pool was to my jawdropping unpredictable suprize spot on.
So creative! Loved it 🤙🏻
wish some one from Jakarta, indonesia will invite you someday! You surely so cool Casey!
7:35 nice haircut bro! i guess
How does he film the scenery outside the hotel when he's in the pool?
For the first time Casey wasn't late!!!
ppl.from.Finland, or just Scandanavia all together seem so nice and lovely 😁
Jäger on tap? I need that in my house lol
This was a good ass vlog
What is your job Casey?
12:47 when you realize....
He has a great platform to truly inspire people! Hopefully, all that attention doesn't overwhelm him.
Forget the pool.  Tell me where I can buy that mic. and app!
This vlog was an ode to the old season 1 & 2 Casey and incredibly refreshing and entertaining. Far better than the lower quality he's put out more recently imo.
7:34 love the music
wow CASEY wherever you go your popular...GOOD JOB..YES YOU CAN BE A U.N AMBASSADOR..CHEERS
How is it possible that everybody in this world knows about you and you've still got less subscribers than that pewdiepie-kiddo.
We have a better one in Houston! 🤘🏽
this is art.  for all the people who love his content but always forget to press the like button. here is a reminder.
Love the music in this
This is the best vlog ever
Casey, what model Garmin Fenix are you wearing?  I just ordered the Fenix 5 and can't wait to get it!
i love helsinki ! beside the cold it's a great city, the architecture, the atmosphere, the food !
Talk about air pressure.
This looks Awesome CASEY I swim but this is second level
lmao Casey lowkey just wanted to see that girls ass at 12:23
U GOT A BOTTLE OF WATER IN FINLAND?!
why are the vlogs so far behind? I thought you just weren't making as many.
Haha how amazing all these kids yelling CASEY!!!!
We wait for Baku, Azerbaijan
one of your best vids yet, was almost like a movie...amazing, love from trinidad
i want to see a bts look at how Casey shog everything from the pool, with the drone and every thing. he's such a master
12:24 Cash me outside girl .... how abou dat
that was the worst over acting I have ever seen
That one kid on the eating part was Morty from Rick and Morty.
Yo Casey!  I love how you put the mess ups in your filming in the vlog! It adds a great sense of comfort for all of us small film makers to know that the masters like you mess up as well! Love your stuff man :)<3
at 5:27 is the building casey jumped off
Easily the best part of the video = that Impromptu Karaoke Sesh at 4:21 :D
Finland is so happy overall. socialism can work and it's the future
Too awesome just too awesome...
This music makes me feel like going skydiving
11:01 poor kid :'(
This is what I love about Casey: He describes 90% of the things as the coolest thing ever and I believe him each time he says it.
i love this pool
Pipba - layba
I was wondering where that was then i realized thats where i live
Youre a legend. I wish I would've met you!
What a sharpness! Nice!
11:31 Did anyone else think the cruise ship was floating?  lol
Casey  is the worlds biggest fucking douche bag
whats the last song called? Andrew applepie but what song?
Casey Casey sometimes youre just too OP , one awesome thing after another awesome stuff . You really are one hell of a moviemaker.
Flying your drone over a crowd of people indoors seems pretty responsible.
That ending shots was gorgeous.
If anyone wants to know what the app that guy is using for karaoke, it's called 全民k歌
ain´t no 1000 feet buildings in finland :D
6:45 I can't tell you guys, how much i dislike when locals down play their own food. Be proud and own it.
Are Rick and morty from back to the future?

I don't know why you are so stupid about them being monsters. You don't know that wild animals are not monsters, do you?
lions rule  i actually want one🤗
That's just their species.
I walk my turtle on a leash what's wrong with that.
And those animals are not monsters.
No I don´t because tigers shouldn´t be pets of people that just want something cool or even german magicians.
u know u can take the stink gland out of the skunk and what is that type of cat that won the guenis world record i want one 
None of these are monsters idk why you would call them this
A friend of my father had a pet crocodile, but he had to release it when it grew up because of his huge size :(..?
I thought that im watching The Talko...
I am a dog lover and pit bulls aren't that scary I have met over 5 in my life and I am a owner to a bull lercher
this is weird and no lies but.. ireally like the smell of skunk. for me it smells like a bananas
THEY ARE NOT MONSTERS THEIR ANIMALS
If I ever buy or adopt a pet ferret, I will choose a white male one and name it Draco!
You are joking?.... these creatures are not monsters but also she sounds like Mellisa from planet Dolan....but still they are animals monsters are a complete different fine
Enderdragon Afs to true
I want to raise a tiger to be able to be kind and never EVER harm anything not even a fly!

Oh so animals and humans are monsters now
your calling these animals a monster u guys are rude
Chimpanzees are not monkeys their apes 
i like,s lion
I saw a guy walking a duck...the duck was on the leash and it was the funniest thing I've ever seen
5:17 Cat: What's happening? Who is this guy? Why is he holding something? I'M SCARED!
that is a tortoise, not a turtle. a tortoise lives on land and a turtle on water and land both.
i would love to just see a pet in my house
Fyi these are not monsters they are animals who just wanted to be adopted and wanted to be loved... These video is very offensive
Ludo can't compare to LOOONG CAT from Mystic Messenger. no cat can't, and in terms of beauty Elizabeth wins. ;)
Skunks are descented at the breeders when they are born...those probably had no scent glands. I've smelled skunk. You could not live in a home that smelled like their spray. That woman is f o s.
misleading title much fuck you
I would want a tiger or a lion
they are not monsters they are animals
ok im a animal lover the things are rude  animals are not monsters there loving animal when you dont threaten them they will not attack you except there carnivorous
ANIMALS ARE NO MONSTERS!!!!  IF A LION IS A MONSTER WY A CAT NOT HUH? THEY ARE IN THE SAME FAMILY AND IF A CAT WANTS IT ALSO CAN DO DAMAGE!!! LIKE WOLFS AND DOGS!!!!! SO DONT CALL ANY ANIMAL A MONSTER OKAY?!?!!!
i love wolfs like if you want em to
Im whatching this on 2017 4th me
they are animals!
A Crocodile!! I want one!! CROCODILE LADY!
i would wont a fox
Adopted???? You mean caged and forced to live with these stupid human beings!!!!
Btw I want to adopt you. (look at the description)
If pig is a monster, then you eat monster.
pigs are cute !!!!!!!
Shut your mouth bruh! Esther is not a monster I love her so much and she's the best. She's the sweetest and cutest thing evehhhh
Ugh. I do not have the time and energy to tend to a wild animal. Besides, they're WILD for a reason. They have natural self defense instincts that make it dangerous to keep as pets. Better to admire from a distance.
and that's why I got a fox
how can you call them monsters?? it's wrong
These animals are not monsters. Humans are.
I Love PITBUls there good dogs
THEY'RE NOT MONSTERS! I want a wolf dog
The pit bull comment infuriated me cause pits are my favorite dog breed
My old cat was 3ft 8in and he was the most lovable ball of fluff ever (rest in peace)
Am I the only one that imagines Baby Ester, like when she was small, saying "How you know I'm not big!?!" Ester's inner Bambam. LOL. Got7 for life.
Those skunks are most DEFINETLY de-glanded.
No animal should be called a monster it's just rude and it's sad
it's not a turtle, it's a tortoise...
Only available in supply drops
It would be better to create a weapon against cancer. Than mothers and fathers of bombs.
Father of all bombs takes second place to Mother of all bombs...remember never mess with the fury of an angry mother/mother bear.
Thumbnail look like Mike Wazowski from Monsters, inc.
https://m.soundcloud.com/dolemize
Song name:Red Alert 3 soviet March   Just in case if somebody need it
Back at it again with the 100+ killstreak
Let's face it. It's not truly going to be the world we all want without all out nuclear war. I like that roundy Russian foab.
red alert 3 music much?
why does it look like the Tsar Bomba?
I couldn't help but salute to the Mother Land while watching this.
Did you just assume this bombs gender?
Thanks for the ear rape bruh
They're using Tsar Bomba photos...
*I can only get a UAV or a Sentry Gun. I never can get a MOAB.. FML.. :(*
Make the head pointy
Russia singed her eyebrows.
I feel bad that he has to take care of all the little bombs after he lost his wife. RIP MOAB
Next is Grandfather of all bombs lol
Pretty sure the US has a GOAB, (God Of All Bombs) ready to blow the whole world up
dont make me drop my fagot of all bombs bicth doesn't even explode
My god, idiot world leaders everywhere I look. We are all just a bunch of pawns in their world:/
Nice Red Alert Music
That is the most Russian music ever
0:24 I found that scene cute
Why is this in music?
The day that they develop MILOAB (Mother In-Law of all bombs) we are all doomed.
My uncle's Galaxy Note 7 blew up much harder
Every human being have blood running through them and the only thing different from everyone is the mind! So believe every live does matter
To bad we can't drop this beast on all the feminists and sjws in the world 😈
To bad we can't drop this beast on all the feminists and sjws in the world 😈
lol what is this bullshit
I wonder what the GOAB (god of all bombs) would look like?   lol  nice vid!
Ironic how its called " *Mother* Russia"
So where's the tranny of all bombs?
mor dislikes than likes XD
my bomb is bigger, no, my bomb is bigger, boom, the World ends.
Glory to the motherland!
the pictures you used were the tsar bomba
Fk the bomb what's the name of the song/anthem
It's mother of all bombs aka Moab
what if the moab cheated on foab. Oh shit !
Why the dislikes?
the most powerful weapon? what about nukes?
Wait until the GOAB (God of all bombs) shows up. Instant annihilation!
Tsar Bomba is mother
What's next GOAB. Grandfather of all bombs? Make a whole family line!
Another Cold War?
NOAB (nigger of all bombs) turns white people into black people.
What's next DOAB (dick of all bombs)
What a meme
Better watch out for them feminist they might trigger a bigger explosion when calling  FOAB more powerful then MOAB, they might view it as sexist lol
MOAB and now FOAB ... ehat is this the coldwar?
Bad editing lol
Why does it have a parachute? The MOAB just blows up once it gets close to the ground.
goab..... granny of all bombs
lmfoaoaoao Russia fighting back through youtube
Russia needs to be our allies in the fight against radical islam.
WOT IN DETONATION
In one day, all the human beings would extinguish due to these horrific weapons..
That's some cool illegal Russian fireworks
this weapon has never been used.
The Russians where always about one-upmanship. During the Cold War, they one-upped themselves into the poor house.
What is the name of the song?
Can that bomb make me feel like a failure? I mean that's what my dad did.
The MOP would like a word with you.
MAKE LOVE NOT WAR         Does anyone else remember this from the 60's70's ?
America and its ally Russia should both be turned to ash.
Rise of The Reds anyone?
I like how they show pictures of the tsar bomb, the most powerful NUCLEAR weapon ever created, with a blast 3,333 x the blast of Hiroshima
wheres the KEM STRIKE?
mother of all bombs now father of all bombs whats next the Grandma  and grandpa of all bombs lol
i feel someone soon gonna upload a new video and call it the "grandfather of all Bombs"
Hmmm... in the light of the success of the American MOAB, an insecure Russia has to resort to old Soviet-style "socialist bombs are superior to capitalist bombs"-type propaganda. :-)
Feminists be like "The Father of all bombs" is trending but not the mother of all bombs? Wow sexist.
for motherland
Glory to aztotzka !
Tell me anyone that got 25 kills?
Made in the U.S, tested on ISIS blood
The first picture was a pic of the Russian nuke tsar bomba
MOAB is better... russia is copy cat terrorisim supporters
It's fucking shit compare to moab, you can compare it to the size of the explosion and aftermath it's nothing compare to moab
Bad damage to that building, but didn't take it down. A Fukn' Texas Firecracker (FTFC) would have left a hole the size of Russia.
hahahahahaha Russia thinks because its big it will yield more damage huh? haha hwhwhw silly Russians, bombs are Americans speciality!!!
sorry Russia the mother wears the pants in this family
Why have a FOBA when you can have a nuke instead?
Shitted a FOAB after taco night two days ago
GUY GUYS!! Check this before it ends!!!! https://vk.com/id427174619?w=wall427174619_2
Nurture his interest on firetrucks. Cutie little one.
This video has already gone viral. Next he's gonna be on like Ellen. And the guest surprise is gonna be a fire fighter and he's gonna get to see and ride in a fire truck. 😂
Who else thought the fire truck was gonna ramp through the window
This is so funny and cute, and I think this kid is pretty smart to know this much! I could so picture this kid being a lawyer when he grows up.
Am I the only one who was waiting for the fire truck to crash through the wall?
Why is this trending?
he's getting a life time supply of fire trucks from Ellen
As his neighbors house burns to ashes.
FIWER TWUCKKKK IS HEWER!!!
Yes yes, how adorable! Pay no attention to the burning building or engulfed pedestrians running in agony, because ladies and gentlemen...THE FIRETRUCK IS HERE and it is AWESOME.
I was waiting for the fire truck to break through the wall lol
*****GASP*****!!!!!
omg that was so cute..... <3
Watch out for the blinds. those cords get wrapped around necks.
Holla at the Magic of Rahat style captions
so cute haha
This is the most adorable video I've ever seen 🤣
Ahh that's cute
My heart and my soul
*Watches right after the Delta Airline video*
Me when I'm in public and see a dog
Not even funny. Kids do stuff like this all the time. I love kids and comedy but where am I suppose to be laughing at ?
YES A NON VERTICAL VIDEO!
The captions are on point lmao
I wanna see the firetruck 🙁
im assuming everyone here thought there was going to be a firetruck bursting through the window
Hmm, can this be autotuned into a song?
the fire truck is here  To be continued
How cute........ And then they grow up!!!!
It's all fun and games until he figures out how to start a fire just so the firetrucks come to the house!
FIIIIRRRREEEEETRUUUUUUUUCK!
This is gonna be great ytp material.
So cute how he runs off haha.
I loved fire trucks when I was a kid. So did my kids.
This baby sucks ass.
Delta Airlines would still kick him off.
This is me when I see the waiter coming with my food😁
*IT'S A FIIRRREE TRUUUUUUK*
are you fucking kidding me this is trending
Then a homing missiles targets the house and the whole house is destroyed
Lol were dumb negros burning themselves again?
This is so staged. I didn't even see any firetrucks.
@Anonymous ? Me too, lol! God bless that little creature...
Why is this #6 on trending
than child can speak english better than meh...
Anybody thought Babadook or something conjuring was gonna happen?
so this is what it's come to huh...youtube has fallen along with the rest of society. *is no one else wondering why this sht is trending??*
So freaking cute
I thought a fire truck was gonna crash the room. I don't know why
I expect that that fire truck had better been damn gorgeous!
Why do they have a camera in their sons room? That's weird, like paranormal activity, smh white people
Click bait, I see no firetruck
You know, it's nice have videos like this in between videos about bad air flights, Trump, and other stuff.
This is in no way funny or entertaining at all
https://teespring.com/itachi-may-2017#pid=211&cid=5288&sid=front
Meanwhile a house is burning down across the street
Thank you for this clip it put a smile on my face.
Aw, I was expecting it to crash through the wall.
this is what the YouTube trending page is for not commercials
whoever edited this did a good job I could hear the noises as I read the words
Fake Hype!! i thought it was going to crash through the room 😡😡😡😡😡😡
WHY DID I THINK THE FIRETRUCK WAS GOING TO SMASH INTO THE ROOM
Ah, to be a little kid again, when everyday objects caused excitement!
aw omg hes like "its so excitingggg" hahahahha melt my heart
Ellen give this kid a lifetime supply of firetrucks!🚒
I hope you took him outside to see it up close.
She;s so cute and so smart nice vedeo.
That was cute.
This is so cute
Adorable. I hope he's not kicked off a delta flight
fucking pointless
So cute! Little boys is me with trains.
who would dislike this vid u have no soul if u did
fuck that white trash kid
Hello. Great video! We'd love to use it on our social channels with a full credit to you of course. Would that be okay?
its a fiiiii-errrrrr-truuckkkkk!!!!
Why did I instantly think of paranormal activity?
I was expecting a Kool Aid moment here.
Anyone else think this room looks like the one in paranormal activity 2? 😂😂
Why is this trending? What a society we've become.
In about a week, this kid will be on the Ellen Show and win a lifetime supply of firetrucks
In Brazil your phone would've been stolen the first day you tried, maybe in just a couple hours
Sensacional!! But, what happens later when the phone is turned on again?
The film takes an abrupt shift in tone at the end. I almost feel as if something happened that wasn't shown like he finally confronted the thief, even as to have a conversation and it went horribly wrong.
Very cool. Thank you for making this film.
And the retarded mentality that this film maker has, is the reason why Europe is collapsing.
will there be a part 2?
What software was he using?
Awesome project!!
I know it's probably been years since you made this, but honestly this is fantastic. @"Anthony Van der Meer", thank you so much! This is incredible!
I WANT A PART 2!!
He took his religion seriously? Why the hell would he steal and take drugs then? Those are grievous sins you know.
Have you seen the film "The Lives of Others"?
This was great, keep up the good work!
What's sad is that the man reminds me of me, I'm alot like him, lonely , desperate, very religious. I don't steal though,
16:25, it's not "Do they have feelings for you?", he is his Moroccan friend, maybe the lawyer in the messages, and he says, "You fuck them all" in the sexual manner he means.
Well made documentary, and cool story
That after-credit scene...
How do you know he was the guy who stole it? It was offline for a few days, maybe he bought it from a dealer.
This was Interesting.
Incredible film! Bravo!
more helpful than uk police who don't care and don't even accept my report to them
17:29  for a look at how retarded this religion is and the people that follow it are. Just as dumb as anyother religion really.
You're a pussy. End of story.
I am both impressed and creeped out. Fantastic stalking there.
my s7 edge was also robbed, they took it out from my pocket while i was distracted
Such a fantastic idea.
Excellent film, if you'd live here in south america you don't would suffer to get your cell phone stolen hahah
second part please!!
Why you decided that this man stole your phone? He was able to buy it from thief...
Incredible. I was enthralled, this  video was riveting! the only problem I have is that you did not have him reported.
I would send him to a prison and make sure he was deported from the moment I got to saw his face.
Fantastic film. This is what real filmmaking is. I throughly enjoyed this and as someone who wants to pursue film, this inspires me a ton. Thank you so much for making this!
Excelent work, well done Anthony!
i need a part 2
Wanna make someone steal you fast? Come to brazil. I bet you can't keep your phone around for 5 minutes if you make it easy to steal :P
Why did you blur the thief's face? Why not show the world his fucking face?
Have you tried sending a "enabledata" command?
Wonderful job!
LOL so many tries to finally get your phone stolen in Germany. In Brazil it would take like 5 seconds or less...
4 days and the phone wasent been stolen damn the safety of this contry
Four days without a thief in Roterdan, 17 phones stolen everyday in Amsterdan.... man, you don't know what a problem is!
Great idea Anthony, congratulations! It's funny to think about the difficulty you had for someone stole your cel phone in Holland.
Still no part 2 :(
he must be arrested, this makes no sense, he will steal other things again
someone make it become a movie
I dont understand. If I stole a phone, id use ductape and cover up the front and back cams. Next Id be suspicious cause it doesnt have a passwork. Finally, Id straightup reset, downgrade, then update to current ios.
it 's a nice Video👍  like and Abbo you gott 👍
Excellent video. Really enjoyed that. Thanks!
I couldn't help but chuckle at "He seems to take his religion seriously"
Fascinating idea and execution of it!
all this for iphone 4 ? xD
Amazing short film. I hope there's a part 2
I eagerly await part 2
Video makes a solid point on Android vs iOS security.
aha great experience thx !!!
Those damned Easter European Egyptians... :-D
all phones should have this app
Anthony, where can I get the soundtrack of this film? Specific the last one as of 19:02  It is amazing!
when you are rooting for your phone to be stolen and no one steals it
observer.ooo more features than Cerebrus
whats the name of soundtrack? anyone?
very interesting and even more unsetteling
what is the app and how to do it?
he's fapping at 14:15 oh lord
Music at the end? Please!
WHATS MUSIC USING IN THIS DOCUMENTARY?? tell me plz
amazing man, well done!
like the way you say stuff.. love the crazy lighting setups and videography..
I have owned the iPad Pro and I will say the $329 is a much better buy because it's at least honest about what it is. iPads are media consumption devices. The regular iPad plays Netflix and YouTube videos just fine.
People in America are so lucky ... I'm from South Africa and I had to pay 700 dollars for my I pad mini 4 (64gb) .....  awesome videos though
Great comparison review!....As always crispy video and audio.
I'm just gonna wait for the iPad Pro 2 to come out and im going to get the 10.5 inch
Can you do a video on just desk accessories and trinkets. Like the plants, lights, figures, etc. I'm trying to go through all your videos to find some cool things to add to my new desk. Thanks!
How can I get a crispy T shirt  I live in Taiwan 😭I really want one
Why does u stopped dream desk episodes, is so so fucking good things to u channel and we.. thanks
I can build a custom water-cooled, overclocked, SLI, custom sleeved Gaming PC. RGB would look tight with a curved monitor.
Whats that song you used to test the speakers
The comparison was very helpful. You pointed out everything that's important. Watching your video helped me decide which one suits my needs. Thank you!
Lmao. The thumbnail of the video is gold. Austin's face doe
stupid avertisement so long!!
great crisp video again.good job on the intro as well.my eyes pop'd out witht he thumbnail
Wow. Awesome review. You did great on comparing the iPads. What camera are you using? Great vid. dude keep up the good work.👍
Great video! I really liked that you added personality to your video!
Great video! I really liked that you added personality to your video!
Awesome John.But I think the new and improved IPad is a freaking Steel.Keep up the good work man.
That terry crews cameo! Love your work on these videos John. I use an iPad daily and I've been thinking about updating to one of these. Probably going for the pro
Awesome video! Your reviews are always really in depth, and I loved the scene with the street😂also it's really cool that you got Terry Crews to be in your video!
Why is Apple putting pickles on their iPads?
Do a video on the best wireless earbuds
I could build a custom water-cooledcooled, overclocked, SLI-ed or potentially crossfire, red over green, custom sleeve, RGB-would-look-tight-with-a-curved-LED gaming PC
did You make the iPhone winner???
This guy needs a $1099 taste of music and not a $0.99 taste of music. What is with the terrible music. I like rock, and rap, and metal
The picture from the IPad Pro 12.9, at 9:05, shows a very clear picture of the cars license plate.......
Great video as always John! Keep up the great work 👍
Am I the only one hearing megaPickle?
nice cinematography, absolutely love watching your videos!!!
Some of the jokes are amazing! You do great! Thanks man.
Ahaha nice video. The 12.9 inch Ipad Pro costs too much. It might look like just a tablet, but any pro will know what you're packing.
good job man you are awesome
good job man nice video
Please ignore my comment!!
You look a lot like Thomas Ian Nicholas from Americaan Pie lol
Cool review and comparison! Sweet slo-mo move by Rick, LOL. Keep up the good work!
That guy better have damn well bin his boyfriend considering how much he cared about his hair.
Hey Jonathan, You are the best in terms of creativity. Oh that shot on 0:20 Awesome.
Awesome cinematography, video quality and, oh my god, the color palette. Literally the most fun tech reviews.. Keep up the good work, man. love your videos.
thank you for adding camera comparison there!, I'm considering to buy an iPad pro since it has better speaker and camera
I could build a Ryzen 7 1800x  overclocked GTX 1080 Gaming PC in that money.
Love your vids. They're so we'll presented and crispy!
Taking crispy to another level great content mate!
Amazing video like everytime and amazing content i like your jokes 😃.  Congratulations from France ! 😀
Bruh, I am watchin this on my ipad 2 from 2011. This shit is cray. 
Great to see you back in action, good job ;)
13'' iPad: wtf
I like your facial expressions and sense of humor!😂 Great comparison as always!
I could build a custom, watercooled, overclocked, SLI or potentially crossfired if yout you like red over green. Custom sleeved, RGB would look tight with a curved LED Gaming PC
Damn couldn't agree more, awesome video man!
Love how tld making vids. funny, refreshing high quality video and audio 🔥. Definitely want to see more collaboration​ between tech youtuber like what Lew, Jonathan, Marques, and Austin has been doing 😂😂
I really love the cinematography John. your work is excellent and the way you incorporate your thoughts on things as well as the editing makes for a great informative viewing experience.
Quality on another level #teamcrispy
Love your videos always a lot of humor great to watch !!!!!
Brother..... Seriously I love your videos, literally those setups were lit, I love the way u make fun in the middle of the video..... All the best for the future brother....
You can tell, how much effort Jonathan puts into his videos. Definitely one of the best YouTubers out there right now. P.S I'm not leaving this nice comment just to enter Mr. Mobile's  Giveaway :D
Lol.....he said mega-pickles
Awesome vid. It looks so ridiculous when you take photos with the iPad Pro 😂😂
hey cool video,love the cinematography!
very nice cinematography bro and i love the comparison regarding the ipads...........
Is it just me or the sound recorder wired being cropped ?
Your hairstyle looks cool! xD
What Gramatik song is played in the speaker comparison? Gramatik Rules!
Hey Jon! Love your vids! Your filming is really on another level. I laughed so hard at the mega pickles part :D Keep it up!
please i want to win
iPad Pro is only good for drawing.
lol lol review
I loved the video. I really like how you make the videos ;)
Wow! In my opinion, I think this is the way to go. I really enjoyed the whole video and I'd love to see more comparisons made on this pattern.  Keep up the good job, Jonathan! Oo, and your sound is just  awesome.
Hey Jon, just wanted to say your videos are great and if you keep working hard like this, then you'll get 10 million subscribers easily. Man you're​ killing it with your videos. 👍
Hey Jon! Loving the colour grading and transitions, thanks for the informative video 😄😄
I really enjoy watching your reviews, they have corny dad jokes which I find hilarious and they're always stylish and informative. I appreciate all your teams work!
Nice comparison video...Also your background is nice!
A salute for taking photo from Ipad 12.9" in the middle of the road. 🤘🏻
Man you're the best YouTuber for me 😊😘.i like every video, this is also ultra crispy 😎. I am waiting for your next video 😳
Great video! Good comparisons between the ipad and the Ipad pro!
hey , amazing video , really like the cinematography of the part where you shot the ipad on the road! really good work , keep it up!,😁😁
Thank you for reviewing the iPad and iPad pro I have had so many questions on which I should consider buying and you answered most of my questions.
Hey Jon. Awesome video as usual. Great to see more people do cameos in your videos, like Terry Crews in this one. Keep it up!
the iPad pro is oversized but still worth it in my opinion, it is a great comparison though!
CABEZA DE HELADO MANTECADO  xD

Hot Zumba Song Hit Right here!

HOLA GENTE!!! KI 100X100 CUBANO CON GENTE ZONA...
One of the songs my wife has on repeat.
"Undskyld" means I'm sorry in Danish! 😄
Being able to understand random parts of Danish is sooo strange 😂
The music seemed to be made for Anthony's style, amazing!
Title was changed ....huehuehue
umm that editing is amazing though
Anthony is Mordecai incarnate

Fart is Speed in danish :)
Hey, I'm 17 and I still don't know how to ride a bike.

Anthony needs to clean his room
Everyday I'm more and more thankful that Hillary Clinton will never be president
Who knew "Gosh" and "Lordy" would be in the news in 2017...
Donald trump said ridiculously over the top things that couldn't be proved just to get votes. And we elected him. Colbert says it for a giggle and some ratings and suddenly hes the villain to some people.
i like stephen better when he doesnt blatantly support hillary
Dam CANADIANS....she was on the way to LOOSING.....looser.....hurrrrraaaaa for all the basement dwelling baristas,.....expreso for everyone 
lol, the lefts homophobe spokesperson....how very.
Does anyone have a link to the insults that he made against trump?
Sore winners...
STILL THE HOST! Colbert is the only thing on late-night that I care about.
fk Liberfrauds and what they think!!
Aw, he forgot to mention how the GOP would be exempt from the bill.  How they wouldn't be charged extra for pre-existing medical conditions for them and their staffers.
Yaaaaassss Stephen!! Double down on that shit. The president is a vile and vulgar creature he doesn't deserve any better.
CLINTON WILL BE GOING FROM THE WOODS TO A JAIL CELL
fuck that libtard... i would stomp his ass, hope i bump it to you. that cant happen though, i hang with real people, not snowflakes/libtards/or sjw so FUCK YOU.
What is homophobic about sucking cock, or loving another man?
Fuck Colbert..use to be funny..stands for nothing....puppet
Call me is a moron and Hillary Clinton is a real Stum bag which
Colbert (Points Gun at John Baptiste): "Say 'Coldblooded' again. SAY 'COLDBLOODED' again! And I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker! Say 'COLDBLOODED' one more time."
Late night television had become a liberal  waste land.
I can't stand to even look at Colbert anymore. He makes me sick.
We have pain killers,  Wait are you a cop?
Anyone still butthurt about Stephen's "Homophobic" joke needs to face facts.  Donald Trump is cock slot.
Talk about 'over prepared'!!! LOL
CBS, don't you dare fire Stephen!
Is this supposed to be funny cos this is Crap.
Fire this prick. Boycott CBS
Colbert's the best pisstaker on the planet.
I'm from Florida and I can say that is accurate.
Ugh. Got a f*cking Trump re-election ad before the video.
He's officially ran out of things to say...
And Obama was the cock holster for Soros.... free speech is great!
*So nothing about wiener getting the emails??? WTF COLBERT*
When I was working vice, I locked this pervert up in the city park toilets. He was wearing  a bra and panties.
Too hard on Comey, Stephen.
Lets play a game.  Who said "We have to pass it to know whats in it."?
Stephen is trash! Can only talk political jokes. No talent!
Repeal and Replace Colbert,  bye bye  Stephen :)
2:36 "He should have stuck with dog catcher... uhhh... because we know they don't grab pussies" 3:00 "...but I sat there that *MOURNING* and I could *NAZI* a door *LIBELED* no action here."
SOMEBODY PLEASE KILL THIS PATHETIC PUSSY SJW & HIS ENTIRE BLOOD LINE!
You should be happy with Comey. He listed a whole document of crimes that Hillary Clinton and Huma Weiner commited, yet he didn't recommend charges because they didn't have "malicious intent".
Stephen colluded with the Clinton Campaign. Oh Lordy!
#FireColbert  Don't have another white male to replace him.
do people really find this guy funny?
Just another day of HATE by liberaturds! Wear your mask, riot and bully, burn our flag and you categorize people!!!!! Don't you folks see what they are? Liberaturds are the new KKK. Party of HATE!!!!
you did that Colbert...great job
I click on the videos icon and it says error, is he in trouble?
also, the piano guy sucks with his stupid shout/singing
How many more votes did Hillary need to win , another 3 million ,would 10 million over Trumpanzee have won it for her ???
I love your show! :)
really? this shit is relevant to some people?
Is it just me or is Colbert wayning in popularity?
"Press Secretary and dad barely holding it together in the Six Flags gift shop, Sean Spicer" LMAO
Russian Wikileaks. Hahahahahaaaaa fuck off.
As for the FBI investigation into Trump Comey opted for the door 'conceal'. If only he could take us back to that day how hard the dicision must have been for him...
Colbert , YOU the man
Proud to see you have not been fired! hahahah Fu... dump. We love you  Stephen. In a fraternal way beware!  Greetings from Portugal.
Can we talk about Colbert's trouble he has stirred by using inappropriate homophobic names? Liberals are loosing their minds!  #FireColbert
Wrong combination, Hillary. What swung it for Trump was a combination of Comey's letter and Obama's announcement of a 25% spike in ACA premiums - both unnecessary interventions.
I really want one of those Spicer posters.
What's going to be hilarious is when delusional hillary runs a 3rd time for presidency. I can't wait
Stay human was really rockin it at the end there
I can't stand Jon the piano retard, he's so annoying!!
I'm really more insulted by the idea that there is someone other than Hilary to blame for the fact she lost.
Someone got triggered by this election
We're with you Stephen; tell Putin's Bitch exactly what he is!
I'm a bi-sexual trans female and I FUCKING LOVED THAT JOKE!!!   I stood up in my fucking chair I was so excited to hear that shade.  People need to stop getting so butt hurt over damn good insults.
Great Man Colbert! Keep up the good work! :)
what friend did trump insult?
hey, leave us Norwegians out of your political mess! 😁
This fucking oven dodging Jew needs to be gassed! Along with many ( not all ) others.
this show need to be cancelled!!!
Hay Colbert you still the host? Good for you, you no gag cock swallowing faggot. Hahahehe
that joke made me uncomfortable and inappropriate show respect to gay community!!!
1 more 👎 for this liberal lunatic.
I love Donald Trump. Can I be his cock holster? Then I can bite it off by accident. Oh wait I can't because there is nothing there to start with.
Colbert in his natural habitat. He was born to do this.
https://www.facebook.com/capcitycomedyclub/videos/10154575245363683/?hc_location=ufi Yay Steven! Someday I want your Job!
You did asshole you ruined Clinton and the American people
Did Sean Spicer expect Kal Penn to jump in and take questions for him? If so, someone should tell him that Designated Survivor is a fictional TV series and Kal Penn was employed by Obama's White House - not Trump's.
COLBERT IS HILARIOUS!!! ALWAYS LOVED TO WATCH HIM!! From the Daily Show, Get To Know A District to the White House Correspondence Dinner with George Bush. WHAT A TALENT!
Is Comey a big fan of Lorde-- the NZ cool singer?  Perhaps he gets guidance from her..?

*Like & Subscribe for more NBA highlights all playoffs long*
Fake channel has more subs than you?
You think curry shoot 3's good. White people got 3's down to a science lol. No bs.
Lebron is a fucking train. Kyrie uniform to big. Korver will be a problem in the finals. He gon be the deciding factor when it come to them clutch 3's.
Say Heah, We got the Gold, Yeah, Golden LaBron James !!! Go Cav's !!!.,,.
Where's my super lebren James man
I haven't watched the nba in years and even I can tell you warriors and Cavs in the finals
Nba is rigged folks
Call the police--we just saw Barney being raped by a man with a sword!!!!!!!!!!!
The nba sucks the game play is so bad !!
CAVALIERS RULE TORONTO RAPTORS SUCK
Series over or naw
King James remembers almost losing to the raptors
Cavs got a valid bench
the cavs are playing much better basketball than golden state... they deserve to win
Might as well add Ibaka to the list of MVP potential players that the thunder had
8:28 this is just a thing of beauty
Defend the land....forever.... when Kyrie has more than 8 assists I feel good our biggest problem is center position who can stop the Cavs in playoff mode.....mmmmh....nobody
you know you doing good when they hate and make fake channels
is this the real ximo???
*lebron trying to be like kyrie with his handles* 😂
What about the one with 109K subscribers? It also says official.
Trash brothers, you want some more? the King will out you back in the dumpster where you belong 🚮
XIMO IS BACK! THANKS, SATAN!
The King has spoken & put his stamp on game one like Dat,like Dat.And Game two on it,on it... Perry Cain Dubdie Dat....KingUp
I love your Highlights Ximo Pierto!  great work.
I have a really strong feeling that the Cavs will be nba champions again and I am a Cavs fan as well.
Raptors might get a game if they lucky enough.
Lavar ball did your hair run away from your face?just wondering cos your head shiny asf lol
good stuff ximo!! i seen this channel go raptors!
Do the Raptors really believe they're gonna win any game against the Cavs???
my boy Dave East
It's game 1. So chill
If Kyrie keeps playing like this.. I mean is Earth round??
@0.55 was so sick. Nice to see the Cavs firing on all cylinders. This has been one of the better years for playoffs match ups in both conferences. Can't wait for this years finals!
Ain't nothing ..................this two teams have the same chance !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
that kyrie crossover made me cream my pants holy shit
It will be very difficult for the Raptors in my opinion Cavs in 5
Cleveland is my best team
ayeee dave east
am I the only one who piss on the side of the toilet to not be loud
wtf was kyrie doin in the beginning? wtf ?o.O
someone teach P.J Tucker how to not step 3 pt line, please...
Dumbass Casey, He should take out JV and put in NORM, Even i would coach better #FreePowellintoTheStartingLineUpAgain
Not as close as the final score indicated.  The Raptors have a game 1 problem.
wtf was wrong with Kyrie at 00:21 looking like Smokey on Friday when he hit that sherm
That was a regular dunk, not impressive at all.....smh
"as cool as the other side of the pillow"
dahntay jones is goat
TT is changed so fast without her...let alone James Hardon. who would be the next?
I think I'm the only one who cares that LeBron doesn't wear his headband anymore😐
Is Lavar Ball keeping Lonzo from getting endorsements?? https://soundcloud.com/sam-mushman/episode-57
My nigga Dave East was in the building Liiiiiiiiiitttt itttttttttttt lol
Kyrie di best!!! Dat move to the basket and one?!!!
Who wants a one on one with KING Lionbron?!!!
U know if lebron  lost he would be complaining right now talking bout he needs more stars on his team warriors do it without k d take lebron away from cavs there just a 8 th seed
#WETHECHOKE
LeBron Hahahaha Beautifull Moments
is this bball  game or three point contest!!
Toronto, we got a few worlds to describe you    We The S-A-W-F-T SAAAAAAAAUFT.
Dave East in the building
Peep the three raptors fans in the front row standin up every time they score😂
God I hate PJ Tucker Trash ass role player wearing Red Octobers on court foh
Casey still in charge... lol
Get the brooms out
oh no lebrohams doin the fresh prince @6:14, u kno its over at that point..... :
Cant wait for my GSW to whip LeBloop 4-0. Thats if they actually get to the finals
Lol cavs fans need to clam the fuck down after ONE win in a best of 7 series lol at least demar dosen't travel and flop like a pussy like your so called "king" gets away with all the time.
So Cavs just not gonna play Richard Jefferson or we just saving him for the Finals or ECF?
That block by Patterson followed by Korver 3 was when I turned the game off. It was over. It was so damn ridiculous. lol Raptors had no chance.
720P 60fps bitch!!!
8:29 some uncle drew level shit 🐐
Reading the comments Cavs fans are dicks... apart from the odd few
Kyrie at 8:30, LMFAO
alley oop off backboard you don't see that anymore
get the broom sticks out.
What happend to kyrie in 0:23?
Where was the "Lebron stopper" tho??
Meanwhile "the best player in the nba" scored 21 points on 35% shooting. SMH...
That alley opp to James off backboard was nasty . Idc who wins I just like these games
Raptors need to more defense then offense or out derozen at the 3 start Powell at the 2 Carroll can't lock lebron at all he is not athletic or have the speed
Nice highlights!  Glad Toronto lost.  They cannot seem to beat Cleveland when it matters anyway.
This is the real one?
Cavs are two Deep, As well as GSW... Losing to them isn't a Stain, but its a stain to the NBA.
You are the literal best.

Then do not say that terrorists are Muslims, make a conscientious examination, and you will see that you are not so different from those who lower your skyscrapers.
pretty much useless just shoot down the c-130
not impressed
Yeah Donald trump already used the Moab and he just started president
Who came here because of BTD series?
"its hard to be accurate with such a giant bomb" you have to just be within a mile lol sounds kinda easy
What do they do to keep it shiny?
The gloves have finally come off, faggots.
A pile of rubble now a pile of rubble before no change
Donald Chump likes to unwind watching this while a Russian whore pisses on his face.  He's one cool dude.
Let's drop this on Isis and North Korea and and are enemies lmao
Go trump!!!
no son ingenieros, son asesinos  y destructores !!! They are not engineers, they are murderers and destroyers !!!
In Soviet Russia, MOAB drops you!
Is this a WMD?
interesting :^D
AS LONG AS WE  DONT LISTEN TO MIND AND COMMON SENSE, WE KEEP BEING TOYS OF FED OWNERS, WE CARRY STONES TO THE NWO PYRAMID. CANT WE SEE? THEY WANT US TO KILL EACHOTHER. WHY BROS WHY?
So much better then those fucking nukes God I hate nukes
If I get drafted to war and kill 25 NK's, you best believe I'm calling this in
the mother of all bombs is the "Tsar"
It was a waste of a bomb to drop on a few militants.
drop that on kim  of north korea
how come a country like north korea threatened usa?
of course there's a douchy engineer
little did they know, a dumbass would become president and we would drop this within 100 days
idk,looks like a typical us stupid fag joke
Heave you seen the tsar bomba
thrump like that
corea x United States =MEMES
if it only blast a mile in each direction how would we take out north Korea it would take like 5000 we would be bankrupt as tax payers would see a rise in the already tax amount set
Men and their destruction!
If you like this, you'll live the "daisy cutter"
TSAR BOMBA IS THE MOTHER OF ALL BOMBS!
That has nothing on a nuke! Looks like a firecracker!
My only wish is that humanity doesn't bomb itself to oblivion.
Correction it has now been used on ISIS
I hate humans
they used this on syria
America is great at killing ppl and stealing their resources
Can I get one of these at an Indian reservation ?
come on not a the war please
The expiration date for them is 2018.  So we have to use them up.  Any excuse will do.
drop 100 more!!!! way to go trump!!!! awesome!
drop food insted look what happens
And then fucking Russia comes out with the father of all bombs lol
If humanity put the same effort into fixing the planet vs destroying it maybe we wouldn't have so many problems.
I hate that the boom isnt delayed :(
America - The real terrorist !
this bloke so proud of what hes invented , hes well proud of himself hope he realises what hes done when he wakes in hell
These engineers should all be screened for aspergers!
1:32 thats where space x got that from
designed by taco bell
I thought it was a big bomb! Looks average.
LoL.  operation iraqi freedom? what's next? operation Syria Disney world? operation ISIS coffee shop?
lol I like how this thing is made to kill people but they are cleaning it like it is a trophy
Drop it on the pakis
they should have dropped one on iwo jima
Yes cause tsar bomba was smaller
then they ask why are people starving all over the world when they waste so much trillions in weapons to kill,I hope you all go in  hell
This "engineer" in yellow shirt is missing the nazi swastika on his forehead.
2:09 That sounded like certain explosions in DooM (not the 2016 reboot AFAIK)!
DAMN SON TOO BIG TOOOO BIG
2 Kings 3:4  Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and used to pay the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams.
*awesome* want one!
@0.50 That right there is American pride. We polish our weapons of mass destruction for our enemies.
I just watched Russian Tsar bomb real footage and with comparing this MOAB is a firecracker
yea you white people.  u take pride in how u destroy shit.  this is why your race is dying out.  there is no stopping with u people. since the caucasian race been in power there has been non stop wars around the earth
Um, the grand slam bombs the brits uesd during ww2 were 22,000 lbs....
How was the Moab Syria?
We dropped this in Syria😂😂
Oh yeah i tried this in Garry's Mod
Got there late again you Americans Britain was dropping 22,000 lb bombs in ww2 called the grand slam so how is the Moab the biggest non nuclear devise ?????
BIG DOES NOT MATTER ITS THE weapons system that makes the missile accurate and we can put a missile right and PUTINS. LAP from America
It has to be pointy!
SAVITAR IS BARRY FROM THE FUTURE THATS WHY HE NOWS  EVERYTHING FROM BARRY AND WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN

Savitar is the Barry in the future I saw the ending on ep 20
When dose it take play?
Can Someonw tell me ..... who is Savitar ???
Saaaaaviiiitar is Grodd  100%😂😂
All you youtubers.. pledge not to tell who savitar really is (if revealed in the next episode) for atleast 2 days... Give people time to watch and enjoy it
Does anyone know exactly what time it comes out? I know the date but not the actual time. PLEASE REPLY!!!
and savitar IS JOHN CENAAAAAA
who fucking is he?!!!
I think Savitar is Flash. Why? In one Episode Savitar says "I am the Future, Flash" but what if he mean hes the Future Flash? "I am the Future Flash" That would be an nice Theorie :D
- You are Optimus Prime!  Say Barry..
'It's about time' - Savitar Damn
when does it come out
Notice that savitar voise is different
I hope barry is savitar..
Ronnie doesn't make any sense he has never had speed
My Name is Jeff
who here thinks Ronnie Raymond could be Savitar or maybe Eddie
Savitar is Dr. Martin Stein
old jay garrick is savitar
Its iris guys.
Easiest solution ever, Cisco vibes to a future where iris didn't die and finds out how they saved her... and boom
OMG!! I think savitar is julien
Siri is iris backwards , that must mean... nothing (mind blown 💥)
my guess  1. barry  2 .cisco 3.wally
Cisco is savitar
no one thinking savitar is VANDAL SAVAGE???? just find out about him, and you'll know why.
Part of me is saying that's eobard thawen and the other barry, both makes sense in a way
Why didn't he show his face. Ahhhhh. Shit men!!!. 
it's ronnie
What is a good website to watch this on in Australia
I believe Savitar is the Time Remainiant of Barry that "died" in the season 2 finale.
"I now who are you" .. but we don't now,who is the savitar ?!?!!?!?!
I think Savitar is Ronny
i think its harrison wells...
If Savitar is The future future flash I'll be pissed if Future flash didn't tell Barry. Like you can stop it JESUS because if Iris dies I'm so done like this kid has lost everybody!!!!!
I wanna see who is Savitar!!! damn, I don't wanna wait!!
How would it be Barry, Savitar was the first speedster
SPOILER ALERT!!!!      Flash Kills Savitar :O One of the only people he kills :O
Since we can't see Savitar, so its definitely  JOHHH NNNNN CENNNNAAAAAAA
like it's an old enemy
The first Wells. Well, my guess :).
It's either Ronald or the future flash
"Well, We Know He Has Legs" ~Eric from Blind Wave
Who is Savitar? Is it Officer Barbrady? Chef? The 1991 Denver Broncos?
I think hes the boogie man!
I CAN'T WAIT JHEEZ
AGGHHH! FUCKING.CLIFFHANGERS.
I'm just happy to see a semblance of the old Cisco back
i think the episode 20 will end like epiaode 19 when killer frost find out how is savitar but now barry will knew
Omg this is soooo col
I swear if Savitar is Joe from the Future or whatever, I will die during the episode. (which would make sense, because Wally's traumatized face, I mean getting a belt spanking from your own dad isn't pleasant at all).
The Flash: I Know Who You Are  Savitar: Finall The Flash: Just Kidding I don't Know Savitar: Damn It
maybe savitar is iris? it could be
I just realized that savitar has the same voice as jigsaw.
the original nut kicker and the guy who tried to end kobe career
I know Dahntay Jones is a scumbag, but ejected because of that? Too soft.
loses 2/3 of his salary. wow such a fine. talking trash on a garbage time. what a fuck up dude. he is not grateful of being a NBA player instead he show off how shit he was after Cavs gives him a 2nd chance.
ABOVE WHAT HE DID IN THE PAST, CAVS FIND THIS DIRTY JONES VERY VALUABLE IN THE FINALS
CAVS smell like ass
the next scalabrine
KEKEKEKEKEKEKEKKEKE Cool Ass
This Nigga Look Ass And Probably Smells Like Ass 
lol he scored -99 points and talks trash? lmao
Hate that this bum player has a ring. I don't understand how this guy is still in the league.
Set up!  He will get a games suspension when Cavs use him as an enforcer in further games.  Its a set up by the system against this fearless man.  He have to be cunning the rest of his career.  The NBA don't like him.
man i swear i hate the cavs  tjey all some BITCHs led by a queen bitch
douchebag cavs
LeBron watching the game on the sideline like; ¡DAMN, THERE GOES MY MONEY AGAIN! ...  hahahaha
Now Lebron has to pay his fine of about $6000. What an Idiot
How sad for Dahntay Jones where your NBA career is to come off the bench solely to be an irritant pussy boy for Lebron, then he pays your fine.
I'm rooting for lebron and the cavs and even I would say that's not cool. c'mon you Jones I aint gotta act like that..
Must have heard his team's fanbase too much lol
Why talk at that point of the game ?? It's over lol
Tf was that 😆😂😂nba got way too soft now
NBA became soft af
Lol wtf did he say?
Jones always been a bitch
Cavs fans... Get your Excuses ready for the game 2 loss
Love it My man Extra AF , LET THEN KNOW WHO THE CHAMPS ARE
They hired him to fuck with people & if it came to it get kicked out fucking with the other players lol they can afford to lose him😂. Every team got that one dickhead
SOFT LEAGUE
This nigga's contract literally cost the entire fine Lmfao that sucks and only 3 minutes but I heard Lebron is paying for it so it's all good.
haha...gets pumped after he makes a wide open dunk. Nothing to be excited about. Muggsy Bogues can still make that dunk today too😂
This entire situation makes no sense
barney the dinosaur sucks
The NBA gets softer every year its pathetic
who the hell is danhtay jones lmao
Literally did nothing they should take the call back
Can we boycott the NBA after this year? I'm tired of punishing players for talking and looking at each other. They want players to be angel robots 24/7.
Did they really eject somebody with 30 seconds left in the game, really?  LOL
how many years till the NBA bans eye contact lol
Jones is a badass lol.
what's with all the Ts last night?!
oh cmon this league got so soft...since when is trash talking not allowed...pussy ass bitchy league .... and also: I never got the rule why hanging on the rim is not allowed :D such a pussy league
That was stupid. And I don't mean the half a second of trash talk. My god refs, let petty shit like that ride. Players are constantly saying shit ALL THE TIME! This is THE PLAY-OFFS!
why would we resign bro tf do he do besides sit on the bench
This is why the NBA can really suck sometimes and will never keep up with the NFL. Soft bs like this. Refs making up rules as they go along
This dumbass. lol  It's dope that you still got that kind of hops at the age of 36 but why yap at a rookie who basically just stood there and let you dunk? lol Waste of $6k
And Edy doesn't get playing time
when will dahntay jones figure out no one cares.
I would like to see LeBron James have career ended for good. what a piece of shit he is.
This is soft. He would never have gotten this technical in the middle or beginning of the game, so It shouldn't be one just because the Raps got slapped
Idgaf what he said no action was taken so why tf is he being ejected man smh NBA is fucking soft nowadays is just pisses me off. Whats the NBA without a Lil title trash talk
NBA should let the players wear diapers too.   League has become so soft😧
I thought Nene from the Rockets getting ejected was bad.  There wasn't anything here to even claim worth an ejection or barely worth a technical foul.  NBA is soft.
if the nba could,  it would castrate its players, theyre getting as close to it as possible nowadays
refs hand out techs like candy now and days
Jones is a dirty old bastard.. that guy white guy was been nice.. Ibaka would of blocked that shit.
He will never see the court again 😂
Tristan Khardashian be like "Smdh"
18 seconds left in the game and he gets ejected?!!? seriously??? He should have got the technical and that's it the ejection was completely not necessary
what's the point for the technical at the of a blowout game in the playoffs would had like to see if lebron would had got ejected from doing the same thing
what the world !!!
Game has really tuned soft.....trash talking would bring a whole new agenda to the playoffs like the 90s smh
Meanwhile draymond can pop all the shit he wants at Paul pierce
The ole man dunk that ball tho u young bucks can't do it at 21
When you get a D- Teammate Grade after playing 3 minutes in pro am.
DIRTY PLAYER IN A DIRTY TEAM
haha stupid old Duke player
Who Cares That He Dunked It . I Feel Bad For This Man Getting Payed 9000$ . Lebron Should Talk To The Manager And Give This Guy A 3 Million Contract
This type of shit makes basketball more pussy than fucking soccer smh
i watched this and this was funny... the guy didnt even try to block him, after the dunk he look the guys straight in the eye and trashtalk him... hahahaha...
Played two minutes, totally worth it...
well if a non cavs player would be ejected for that everybody would be like 'damn the league is too soft man' but in this case being ejected is acceptable smh...
Refs must have had a 15+ handicap on the raptors. Bent fuckers.
politicaly correct wussy usa.. jesus
Norman Powell gonna go off next game.  He must be PISSSSED.  😂
this scrub gets a dunk n thinks he's the shit, lol foh
I HOPE THE CAVS SWEEP THE FUCK OUT OF THESE TORONTO BARNEYS PUSSIES
This is what happens when you're cooped up on the bench too long
My nigga'.  I wish the Pacers never would've let him go.....
this dude is pathetic. Hurt Kobe on purpose. then talking trash when you win in a blowout playing in garbage time. like who does that? what a low-life
Does anyone remember when Cp3 and D Will were competing for best point guard? Now Cp3 is unanimously the better player, but D Will might get a ring and Cp3 will probably never play in the NBA finals.
Forget that he got ejected for talking smack as a verteran, but really remember the fact that he got ejected for talking smack. Lmao. NBA is mega soft.
trash ass nigga tried to injure kobe.....
bum ass he was always trash
Nigga thought he was MJ after that weak ass uncontested dunk.
Dahntay jones is a POS thug and a cocky bitch. No wonder the Cavs brought him back.
The real question is why the fuck did Ty Lue play this washed up retard instead of Derrick Williams and Edy Tavares?
He's not a good player and got signed on the last possible day of the season. He should be the last guy talking shit. He made an uncontested dunk, wow.
SCREWATTACK! U SPOILED ONE PIECE FOR ME, U BASTARDS!!
I seriously though h was gonna get eaten!!!
ace should have won he can that wouldn't work fire a conductor of electricity he wouldn't be hurt by it like how luffy is rubber a perfect insulator of electricy
Whoever wins the next one should go against Killer Frost. Like how they did with Leonardo from the TMNT.
couldn't natsu also have eaten ace when he is in fire mode?
can we appreciate that it started with a chicken bone
Saw that coming
Honestly I'm disliking this because of how obvious this outcome was of course Natsu was going to win why even make this death battle
samurai jack vs Zoro
this shouldn't even be a battle, by the time natsu realizes his powers he'll just eat him
Can you do a fairy tale dragon slayer battle royal
Listen UP DEATH BATTLE U R going to make natsu go up against luffy so he,ll advenge ace
Perry the Platypus vs Jake the dog
Have they forget that ace can use conquerer haki that can cancel all of natsu, dragon forms & ace could give natsu so much fire that he,ll exploded like in 1 minute melee?
This battle heated things up. Next will chill it back down.
Let me guess: Natsu wins because anything Ace would throw at him would just be eaten by Natsu       I knew it.
Archer (from the show Archer) versus MacGyver (from the show MacGyver)
Vergil vs raiden
Jinmay from srmthfg vs Jenny from my life as a. Teenage robot super
I'm getting sick of these anime fights
please go easy on me Ace is a soft spot like Arieth.
Yoshikage Kira vs any one  Or just any Jojo character 
but wait... even if ace assumed his physical form, then natsu still wouldn't be able to..... OH wait, this is Death Battle I'm watching...
naruto vs luffy
YESSS!!!!! XD ITS GONNA HAPPEN!!!
Not that it wasn't a good fight, but anyone who agrees that it should've been natsu vs naruto, reply
This battle would've been more fair if Natsu was matched with Sabo.
But, Natsu didn't even eat any lightning
I was expecting it I mean fairy tail has some op wizards
Wait. This fight was over a chicken leg?!
whoever thought of mogg deserves a raise
Legion from Legion tv series vs. Legion from Ghost Rider movie.
Dragon born vs black bolt both masters of using there voice as a weapon
Natsu!!! Had faith in ya good buddy!
I'm not arguing the results, but did you have to show Ace's death in that much detail? Twice? Not cool
When will taskmaster make an appearance?
It seemed one-sided from the beginning, but what would haki do to the outcome? Ace never really showed any haki, but with the way Oda's been writing it could be assumed that Ace had Haki.
Dr. Manhattan vs. Dr. strange
Oh look, Natsu beat Ace. I *totally* didn't see that coming.
You forgot Aces Haki but battle was bad and screwattack has not done a good fight ever since they always do piss research.
so hows do natsu retain the ability to use lightning without being a lightning user?
Ace had No Chance from the beginning...sad matchup
So they Spoiler Warning Ace being dead but all that stuff of Natsu's past is fair game? What?
I just want to see someone from bleach not super picky who either just can't think of a good match up atm
couldn't he have just eaten him
Prediction, at 4:10 just found out Natsu Eats Fire... Ace is Fire... I guess Natsu's gonna win this one.
My question is, can Natsu eat a flame war? Early results show negative, but I'm cautiously optimistic.
Oh noooo not again... Natsu I love you but ....ACE please don't die again 😢😭😭
I decided that I would pick up the character who won's anime again. Let's find out
Knew it. Called it. Go check the Natsu summary video if you don't believe me.
If this was Sabo it would be a different story
This is honestly SSOOO FREAKKING COOLLL!!!
Omg this is the first time i wanted a character i was rooting for actually win
frieza vs madaa uhina. if i spell his name right? who thinks is cool match or not?
the mask vs joker?!?!?!
calling this at minute 1 natsu wins
Fire Element VS Fire Element Next it's a Ice Element VS Ice Element? That's convenient.
Sub Zero vs Glacius? Comment me these 2 things 1. Who is Glacius 2. Who do u think will win the next Death Battle?
what about on ships?
he needs to eat lighting in order to use it for a short matter of time
Can guess how many times they said "Fire" in this episode?
Samurai Jack should totally show up around here!
So first it was a battle of fire elementals, now a battle of Blizzard Elementals following after it. guess they needed it if that match was too fired up for Death Battle.
Dcs strongest vs marvels strongest
SPOILER: the guy who uses fire wins
His speed... It's OVER 9,000!!!!!!!!! (5:43)
Luffy vs The hulk
How about a little grudge match with Sabo vs Natsu
how the heck did natsu have lightning when he didnt even eat one???
Do spider man vs scorpion next
how about you make a death battle about sawada tsunayoshi from katekyo hitman reborn and oga from Beelzebub
Wow what a big surprise......
I feel like this was make the fans of Fairy Tail happy after the Zoro and Erza fight
This was predictable , BUT !! srsly? lightning couldnt have beaten him --'
Guts vs Kratos? Dexter vs Jimmy Neutron? Ed, Edd, and Eddy vs The 3 Idiots? 😂 share your suggestions guyssss
This soooo one sided, its not even funny. Like Nastu literally eats fire I wonder who's going to win lol
Probably the stupidest DB yet.Luffy vs Natsu would be alot more interasting
Huh so a fire eating dragon trained demon boy vs one of the nastiest fire elemental pirates ever, this should be intetesting
The fights are getting shorter while the ads get longer. I dunno guys, if you're low on cash, maybe cut some shows instead of clogging them with ads.
Ramza  (final fantasy tactics) vs Corrin  (fire emblem fate)
They forgot to mention that Natsu beat a fire god slayer and his dragon god brilliant flame spell
Sweet video. Really like this kind of thing. Would like to see more. Keep it up.
Thank you to Saydi Driggers and John Herrera from Clamsville Productions for producing this video.

I'm sry niki that ppl did that to u Love u so much ur awesome
love you!!😘
I LOVE how much more you are vlogging!! (:
you can still use a physical key to get in though...
Lol he bought a new car for an experiment XD
put it next to ur phone
Most of these cars still have a keyslot somewhere. I would get a key cut and hide it.  It can open doors, but cant start the car due to no transponder for the immobilizer
The doors will unlock though.
U just bought a car and saving just $4
nice way to SPICE up your car
I wonder what happens when you are driving and you throw the key out the window?
What if u put aluminum foil or something on the bottle so it doesnt turn the car on
All you need to do is wrap foil around the container, that will reflect waves - thus stopping the transponder from doing it's. Not really needed as it works without, but it does add extra security.
Kia has internal and external antennas to receive the transponder.  This is used to prevent  you from locking the key in the car.
simple reason is the steel acts as a Faraday cage, the car can't find the answerback signal from the transponder so it says it is not on the car
The metal blocks the signal I should think...
Happy to see Grant shopping at Kroger
Yeah but someone can still get into the car
Tip cover THE intire inside of THE botel with aluminium foil
they have hide-a-key boxes exactly for this already. i use one on my jeep, i keep a non-chipped key in it so if i lock my keys in i can unlock my jeep but a stanger couldnt start my car with it
he seems like such a nice guy i want him to be my friend
sis you check that it doesn't still offer ENTRY either by being near a door or trunk / liftgate sensor for cars you just grab the handle and unlock passively?  would be interesting ....
Would the magnet affect the transponder's effectiveness with time?
well now we know where your keys are. ;)
PIMP  MY RIIIIDE
Just stick aluminum foil around the bottle to prevent signal from getting out?
sir, will you make a video about how to make a alumina silicate brick
He shops at kroger
wouldn't the magnets and metal interfere with the controller under the car
That still doesn't mean the doors won't unlock.
What about someone unlocking your car door? Does the car door detect the key when it's hidden under the car?
You need to fix the symbol on your dash so it is TKOR logo.
you can use metal sheet like kitchen foil and cover it so it will gonna act like farrady's cage and privent the signal from passing it
Now theifs are gonna be looking under cars
If your car starts when you hide it somewhere, and really like that spot, you can probably put aluminum around the inside of the container and block the signal.
I wish I had a video budget of a car
But why? Why should people hide the car key under the car? O.o
But some cars, such as mine. Has a button on the front doors that opens the door if the key is nearby
Finally someone that knows and explains what  transponders are.  Ohh by the way if you think transponders are something new, they exist since the mid 90s
To be sure that the transponder will not be detected, try to cover the whole container with aluminum foil.
Hey Grant, are you going to put some modifications on that Lexus RX of yours?
If u wrap the remote key in aluminum the sensor will not pick up signal and the door will not open.
what happens if you throw the transponder out the window while driving
what if a thief living near your house watched this and takes your car away
what if different transponders have different ranges or amounts of power so take that into consideration and try it on a newer vehicle Grant.
anyone catch his numberplate? ;)
Make gun powder from scratch
I see that you use a lot of chocolate in your projects, so can you make chocolate with coco beans/powder?
what's the point of having a hide away key? Most cars won't lock its self anyways if the keys are in the vehicle.
In any case you could line the inside of your case with aluminum foil to block the signal all together
No fist bump for you Mr clean
it won't lock with the keys in the car. Because I have the same car
first world problem:  when you have buy a new car for a video.
I drive a Renault and it uses a key card, (the size of a bank card but thicker). Any car hacks for that type of key?
Cant you unlock the car without a key if the transponder is near it
What happens when you hit a pot hole at a high speed will the magnet fall off?
What would happen if you have ferrofluid and a magnet, vs liquid nitrogen?
Plz do more life hacks of cars
Wash that Lexus!
Now the only problem is if you get pulled over in one of the states that will arrest you for having and empty hiding place in your car :/
Line the Case with aluminum foil.  It will block the signal.  Problem solved for 25cents.
If it does still turn on, could you somehow wrap sheets of or copper wires around the bottle with the key inside? Would that at all damage or ruin my key electronic wise like a magnet next to a computer?
Just watched your video on hiding the car fob underneath the car, can you do a video on the different strengths​ of various magnets. thanks.
hey Grant u should put gel ice packs in liquid nitrogen
wont the spare melt from heat when the car is running
what about the car bag
Your T-shirts are awesome
hey grant.  you !at consider making a Faraday cage using some copper mesh inside the container.  that should totally block the signal while the key is in the container
some cars have remote start
it goes by range different cars very on the range keep up the cool work :D
Its a really nice car, what is it?
U have the same car as my mum
you should do a fidget spinner video experiments
Another thing you should be careful about is not to stick the magnet on something on the bottom of the car that gets hot. Because magnets lose their magnetic properties when they heat up.
you can still unlock it though with the button on the door even though its outside the car.
I think that it is a car dependant IF it starts or not
lol that guy at the end was pretty random. I guess you are the king of random though.
But what about being close enough to still unlock the doors for cars that use the little buttons on the handles?
just hope you don't have a f150
There are some concerns about unlocking the cars. Hope Grant checks them out
Grant what if you have a newer/more hi tech car and if the key is with like 10 feet the door will unlock.
But u r pretty famous for the thief to know where the extra keys would be placed
I tried this with my car but it has keyless entry so I need to find a way to put it some where on the car and not get detected. Even under neath the trunk it still recognizes the key?
why not wrap the container in aluminum foil to block the signal from the transponder?
i wish no car thief will watch this XD
I dont understand sound
im new to osn but i like this guy he real and super funny i enjoyed watching his videos when I get a chance because always know how to smile and laugh just because he's a good guy

Trying to watch this at work...   have you ever laughed so hard, but couldn't make a sound, so you just sorta... convulse your way out of your chair?
I can't thank you enough for reposting this, Pete. If you could do the same for all of the ex men, that would be amazing.
Finally an upload! I thought you died Pete
Finally it's back!
Why has this been republished today?  It's old.  I do love all of them though.
YES!!! its been soo long
oh fuck yea,i love your videos
That was a bit harsh, even for a Gambit.
SOOOOO happy to see this back on Youtube! I was really sad when I saw they had been taken down. I hope the rest are coming back too! Will there be new stuff as well?
Unite the Ex Men
Is that Thomas Middleditch?
Why did this get reuploaded?
And thats the final straw there. Unsubbed
man i miss these xD
Is that Richard from Silicon Valley?
well, this ones old.
Pete!! Your back! You have been missed. make more of these, you're awesome!
YEEEEEEESSSSDS
fucking love these
How about you DON'T mass upload stuff?
Need the xman video with that sexy girl tho !The one that read your fucked up mind !
Funny, cats did come back to broadway.
The chemistry between you and Tom is magic.
please keep doing sketches those where fucking amazing.
Love you Pete, but you might wanna get a new social media assistant. These uploads are a little spammy.
I'm really happy to see these all up again! But, damn Pete, you've destroyed my subscription feed for the day. XD
oh I missed that
Oh man I am so happy these are back. I miss this show.
god damn how many fuckin OLD videos u gonna re upload?
Pro tip: don't upload all at once, you'll get fewer views, and people might unsub.
Miss you Petey! The occasional spot on Conan no or @Midnight is not enough.
Hey pete why dont you upload twenty different 3 minute clips instead of three 20 minute clips....oh wait
Finally this is back, my favorite ex-men by far.
Without stuff you are worthless
Hahaha this show was the best. I loved how the monologues weren't on current events, so really it's timeless. You could watch is like Key & Peele with fewer sketches and more on stage content.. #WashMyDamnTowels
You didn't even do the Cajun accent right.... WTF!
Repost but this is one of my favorite sketches EVERRRR
big fan Pete! love this piece.
Subscription feed full of Pete Holmes videos...!!!!
are they back!?
Does this mean they finally cancelled Samantha Bee?
What's happening
Is this foreshadowing your return Pete?
THEY'RE BACK
It took longer to walk through the queue...then you were on the ride itself.
I can't believe all of the detail that went into this!!! If this is anything like what Star Wars Land is going to be, I can't wait!!!
I wonder who wrote the catchy little song?
Is that it?  Just one really amazing animatronic and some black light mushrooms?  What about a story?
How far have the Animatronics come along from Pirates of the Caribbean
never even seen the movie but i wanna see this! that animatronic is gorgeous
Ride in the dark and look at glowing plants and ONE Navi animatronic... Alrighty then.
Can we just talk about that animatronic damn.
This is exactly what I was expecting when I heard river ride... not sure what the hell anybody ride was expecting. This is the family ride. the other Avatar ride is for thrills.
It reminds me of Mission to Mars at Epcot just heavy on the Avatar aspect. Its kind if sad Disney cannot come up with something better than this.
I don't even like avatar and I'm dying for that animatronic <3
WTF this is a cultural appropriation !!
That animatronic though
ok...that last puppet or whatever u call it looked to fucking real.....
3:09 she was deadass straight staring into the camera guys soul
we don't have it in french disney parks :( Mo'at is really beautiful like in the movie,  she inspires me for a next cosplay-dance dress with led wings
Oh wow! This ride looks astounding! And that animatronic is hands down the BEST animatronic I've seen. I so cannot wait for the land of Pandora to be open! Only less than a month away!
What hell, the avatar, was that a robot?  :O
kinda upset, he/she/they cut off  video for full ride :/ And i like the animatronic looks real
That animatronic is revolutionary.
looks boring... :(
And people say Skynet will never happen...
Tried to get my fast pass for opening day and took a big fat L! It looks incredible. Looking forward to going on this even if I do have to wait in the standby line 😂
I'm I the only one who find the animatronic at the end singing creepy
3:02 MA A WAH
That animatronic is simply astounding, I'm truly amazed at its fluidity
Can somone translate Na'vi for me? I'm curious about what she's singing
Are there any drops on this ride??
I want Avatar 2 😢😙 It's very beautiful!!! ❤
The movie sucked, but it may be perfect for a theme park.
They just need to have the animatronic interact with the guests as they go by, why not? They can make the thing look pretty real anyway, not that much more to do (I'm a programmer and work on AI)
Wow everything looks amazing and I love the colors too!
That may be the best animatronic they have ever created.
OMG!! She is amazing!!!
Besides the really good animatronic, I don't see really anything new here. These types of rides have been around for decades lmao
Is there a drop in this?
Wow! this ride looks amazing!!
I know the whole ride can't be uploaded but is there more than the one animatronic? (I hope!! ;)
Hopefully that AA won't break down constantly like Elsa or end up like the Yeti.
I wonder if we're going to get this level of animatronics for the Star Wars park?
is there a full version of the song at the end?
I thought it was a person until it blinked...that wasnt a normal blink...AMAZING!
We asked for 2 and you have us a theme park, beggars can't be choosers I guess, I'm still goooiiinnggg. 😂🤘🏾
it's like a mix of the Pirate's ride and Indiana Jones ride at DisneyLand. o.o
eh, tbh i was expecting it to be more. i'm not blown away
Try not to get jealous challenge!
Wow! What a nice Rainforrest Café! I hope they serve chicken fingers.
And the person filmed horizontally this person is truly a celestial.
Wow that animatronic was incredible.... i hope they have some sort of danger in the ride. the affects are all very good and nice to look at but i a little thrill would be nice.
In California or Florida because im now soon confused
That animatronic is so realistic! I just can't stop watching it..
Whoa.I thought it was only a walkway interactive experience.
In the near future Disney is going to have realism like this in almost all their attractions and I can't wait
Every day we get closer to five nights at freddy's
Getting stoned to the movie is magical... but I bet getting stoned and riding this would be... magical, essentially yes.
better animontronics than frozen fever!
Nice animatronic  but  Avatar is still overrated
I can't wait till may 26 to travel to "Pandora the world of avatar"
I can only imagine what this ride must be like while on acid...
WOW!!!! The animatronic looks amazing.I can't wait to the opening of Avatar land..
I can only imagine where Star Wars will take this technology, talking droids, maybe even walking sebulbas? Or how about an animatronic Grevious?!?! One can dream can't they?
Why avatar?? A little too late there disney. Plus the movie wasnt even that good. Id rather see Aliens or T2 from cameron
am i the only one who thinks that incredibly lifelike anamatronic avatar is going to scare little kids? who by the way would also be too young to watch the movie or know the story...
Its scary because I know the elite will use other realistic robots during the great deception. They are showing us in plane sight that they can fool our eyes easily
A: I can't wait to too ride it! B:That Animatronic is the most realistic tho...
That's got to be the most generic safety announcement I've heard from a Disneyland/World attraction.
I am obsessed with this animatronic. Literally, if I had the money, I would get one installed next to my front door so it could greet people as they walk in.
Doesnt look very good seems short
I actually wonder how many people noticed the inner of the animatronic. At one point 3:25 is when the animatronic lifts her arms revealing a bit of inside of her....
Most overrated movie ever!!!!!!!
How did they get video if it's not open to the public yet
Please get rid of Bugs Land in California Adventure and bring this 😭
Looks lame. Pretty. But, lame. Less than no interest in seeing it.
Ma ewa ma ewa ma ewa, mana wingalo, mingna ving lots lavie. That's my new jam! Been singing it since yesterday.
Cool animatronic. But what's the point to this ride?
That's it I'm not that impressed.....I guess I never really liked this movie ....oh well👎👎👎👎
Wow! I may be going there in October for my anniversary. Really hope I get a chance to see this. Thanks for sharing!!!
I bet this is really fun high.
Why can't Universal Orlando make attractions this good anymore?
Literally my favorite movie ever. I can't get over how much I love this.
I'm suddenly more scared for our future
Incredible animatronic. Very fluid motion. Would love to see the engineering that went into that one.
Looks like the natives could use some Intergalactic Freedom with all that Unobtanium around.
Are there any drops in this ride? For example could my grandma go on this ride? Trying to determine if I should book fast passes for it but want to make sure she can ride .
Karma is coming to United Airlines and Oscar Nunez
"You gonna have to see me when I come to the TICKET COUNTER so you better have the same energy!"
You know the CEO is gonna step-down.
The next time you chumps are sitting on a runway for 4 hours because some loud mouth won't depart the plane remember how you supported this fool.
uncle charla right with this one
when they over book they should refund the ticket price and send them on the next flight free,
This man is rich forever
I always hated united. Their customer service is TERRIBLE
charlamagne shout me out on that troy  tupac ish bro i fucks with you!
There is only one race. The Human Race!
for the price he bout to win on the lawsuit they coulda booked each person on the flight a private jet
lmao how did i miss this one
HOLD YOUR OWN NUTS.!!!
This country is full of so much shit these days smh
Pespi: Our new commercial is one of the biggest PR nightmares this year. Maybe this decade.  United Airlines: Hold my beer!
Charlemagne is funny.
Good for United
Jessie, Al, and the NAACP must be pissed the dude isn't black. It would have been a nice earner for them.
Let the market shares crash.
yes. sounds like tickets about to be cheap. i need a vacay. 
Envy doesn't get it....again.
the customers always right until management is wrong
Money in the bank for that guy! Because this here is a major settlement for the airliner.
how do you force someone off a plane that paid their ticket and then all of a sudden they posted he was a crooked doctor 10 years ago all over the place smfh one thing has nothing to do with the other
uncle tom the one pulled and slam 69 year old Vietnamese dude  to floor his face hit  arm rest uncle tom is big dude he might goes to jail.
I don't think the Doctor would sue because United will cut the check  with the quickness. It better be over $30 million.
damn thts fuked up smh
Either this Asian guy is mentally retarded or he's a crisis actor take your pick!
They could of at least picked a white man. They wouldn't have all this backlash if they just pick their own
I wonder if there would be this level of outrage if this man was black.
it wasn't even overbooked. they just wanted those seats for crew members. they should of held those seats open before the people boarded. who lets someone sit down and then kick them off.
I know they aint use the wendys newyork video 😂😂😂 Breakfast club just to perfect for the culture
Here because of   " D'Armani - Run Across My Mind "
at least they are not getting thrown off while the plane is in the air. that may be next.
UNITED SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES!!!!!!!
Money is power
There's going to be a day that we're going to have to do a national boycott
That was one of the most lowest moments of humanity I've ever seen
Is this how young people get their news? God help us. Ever hear of legit media sources? BBC, NPR anybody?
He got "re-accomodated" lol, terrible lie from a horrible CEO
They treated that po' man like a redhead stepchild. I guess the supposed "majority" ended up being the minority in the long run..... Just sayin'. Po' thang.
Asians are known for being white lovers. I feel kinda bad for the guy but us blacks gotta hold our own nuts. #StayBlack ✊
i would of gotten shot on tht plane bc they aint forcin me out of my seat tht i paid for especially like tht hell no i would of try to fight all them renta cops
how fucked up is it that when I hear about police brutality, I am RELIEVED that at least it wasn't a black man this time
I was just about to suggest this Charlamaighn and I am so glad you put this as donkey of the day. Every time I watched this video it makes me sick to my stomach that poor Asian man really do hope he's okay
SOOOO The Breakfast COONS talked about the Asian dude getting dragged off the plane but didn't say shit when them Asian men was beating the shit outta black women.
dang... what a drag...
Snatched and Dragged off a plane! #BoycottUnited
They had to deadhead the crew in.
three voluntary left one refused.
I hope Dr. Dao sues United Airlines for EVERYTHING!!! FINISH THEM.
this situation is fucked up.... but was I the only 1 whole laughed when he started screaming😂😂
Trust I would be fighting those mfs who would try to attempt to get me off the plane
I just unsubscribed from these fake ass people man .
this shit wild... I was about to get plane ticket with them too. better off taking the greyhounds fucking with these damn planes
Friendly skies ain't so friendly see this why I Luv Amtrack I'm wit u Charlemagne
I would sue tf out of them
Notice it wasn't a white person being kicked off Lol. It's a prejudice situation, and I hope he sues them until he owns that motherfucker.
they did it to the person who they knew wouldnt be of sound mind to know its not right
What's that got to do with me..United Airlines.. If I pay with real money I want real money back!  Not  United flight dollars. I would not have gotten up either unless I was getting my money back.
this what happens when the world is ran off a gangbanger philosophy
What happened to the customer is always right ?
this is racist we need to boycott this Airline
UA Did That Man Wrong Period .
aint gunna lie... I died laughing from hearing him scream.... I feel bad
i thought it was Delta Airlines
the most well deserved donkey of the day ever!!
I hate that overbooking shitt!!! This why ppl be bombing airports!! Shit I've been done dirty by airlines and I'm one more scam away from doing some shit like that too 😂 (jk FEDS)
day #2 where my home state of Florida isn't on the fuckery! the streak continues...
Never flying United again. How in the heck airlines overbook flights in 2017?!?!?
Sue tf outta them
CHECKOUT MY CHANNEL FOR THE REAL TRUTH ABOUT THIS STORY
I would sue them for all the nuts they don't give out like southwest
U can bet cha ass I'll never fly UAL..NEVER!!
United has already invesigated this guy lol. appearantly a felon who traded drugs for a gay sex smh
The airlines would jack the prices up if they could not overbook flights.
He about 2 get fuckin' PAID!!!
The feedback and support has been fantastic, please keep it up and get this video to 200 LIKES!
Sorry but disliking for telling us to like and subscribe to a video we havent even seen yet. After the video I dont mind. but before, yeah no.
what a bunch of idiots. and I'm born and bread here.......joke
Queen's guard should fire at bastards.
the only thing I  think in these videos is assassin's creed. I don't know why.
#queenguards I love these vids and love all ur vids
lot of debils are joking from guards :) idiot age.
Simple solution, to simple-minded civilians .. Stop letting civilians on the grounds.
not violent at all, disliked
This is what happens when you got nothing to do day after day....
where exactly was there any violence ??????? fucking click bait
Disliked for the crap at the beginning
Those dead animal afro wigs they wear on their heads are absolutely ridiculous, I hate to think what would happen to the guard if a heavy rain weighed that beehive down over their faces.
They have to deal with such assholes.
I'm afraid I was rather disappointed with this vid.  Clear case of misleading advertising.
They are all little people its funny bullying them
Nationalism is an infantile disease.
dont waste your time guys on this video, literally no footage on here of them turning violent, just a bit annoyed.
bloody Monty python
nice video, but that's not really 'violent'
The Queen LOL
whatvpeople dont know is that they are real soljers and could be call forward to the front line if needed
1:04 Look! Its a gnome
People suck way to much for me to ever even thinking of having this job xD    I'd know I was a security guard.
I would love to see libs of America mess with these guys.
Morons or what?
not one moment of the guards "turning violent"
With that clothing and formalities, they're making a show out of it... no wonder people see them as entertainment
Only now do i begin to understand how funny Ace-rimmer really is!
What people don't understand is these are combat trained military. Decent amount of them have been deployed in Afghanistan and this is how they treat them sad.
wonder whats going on at 6:00 with the beafeater .... also  its really easy to forget the guards with their ridiculous(subjective i know) bearskins and suc, and really high steps are still actual military
Well, that was 10 minutes of wasted time.
Those rifles are loaded guys.
Someone needs to talk to the UK about these hats.
They look so ridiculous it is hard to take them seriously.
Where was the violence?
What a waste of my time !!!!!!!!!
what did the first guard say after "halt"?
Don't you just want to punch the smirks and smiles off these civilians?
I really don't get all this macho-marching when they could save the calories and simply focus on the main task; guarding. 🌚
Traditions are okay, but I don't like to see real soldiers that fought all over the world to be dressed like toysoldiers and to be treathed by so many numnuts civilians. I'ts a bloody disgrace. Are those tourist aware?
Nice misleading title you knob jockey.
What is it good for?
Holy shit they look ridiculous! like wtf are they wearing? Looks like a big circle jerk of colonial third world rape
what violence? total bs!
So what is the moral of the story here everyone?
such a load of bollocks.. the royal family is an utter joke
I'd like to challenge them at a game of "Simon Sez".
How can people be so discourteous and disrespectful to centuries of their own history?
5 years ago I was witness to some guards Wearing Grey Winter Uniform Marching Near Down St,  knocked down a deaf person who did not hear them coming from behind. They didn´t stop nor cared. Ridiculous.
Is it BS? But, I heard these gaurds are typically ex, SAS and other elite forces.
that's not fashion .
violent!?! lol maybe by english standards.
dude her guards are shit if terrorist comes to london whit AK47 who will guard her then
what are you gonna do call the police lol they work for the Queen
THEY LOOK SO STUPID AHAHAHAH
royal guards are there to do their JOB let them do it
This is bullshit fake news!!  no guards got out of hand!!
so the guards aren't all muslim yet? wow.
oh, the little girl and the Guard, so precious, she feels so safe....thank you for that amazing clip..def. my favorite...she meet her prince.....sweet
why don't these guys get tough on the muslimes ruining their country instead of chasing away little girls?
fucking lobster backs. 300 years and they still march in a straight line. they would die so fast on the battlefield vs any reasonably trained army. shit israel could be these lobsters.
So, I can mess with them as long as I don't touch them or be in their way?
I hate seeing these guys disrespected while on guard. To come back from a tour of duty to then be treated like a joke by some tourist cock womble is disgusting.
Brits are weird motherfuckers.
tf where was the violence
It's sad how little respect people have nowadays.  What do they teach their kids?
What you really need is a Kings Guard, Let the Old Lady retire for Christ sake.
Scary just like an old guard
These young men devote their very lives to a cause bigger than themselves. To have these twats harass them while legal is downright shameful. I hope Americans show more respect.
video title is clickbait. The most the guards did was scream for people to "make way for the queen's guard".
That's probably the worst marching I've seen outside of high school halftime show. Go watch the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and notice the difference. Night and day.
5:37 what the fuck kind of uniform is that xDDD
If they stopped wearing such stupid helmets a lot of people would quit bothering and making fun of them. I mean, how many times have you seen a soldier in uniform with a realistic modern hat being picked on by a crowd??
When ever I see this I think it's rude, I find the way they move and dress is a unique way of culture and love watching this because of that reason. I also love watching Tourists being put in their place
I love the old gear with the future guns!
omg is that a beaver on his head
2:06 You don't touch another man's sword, unless he asks you to...  out with a Yang ;)
I enjoyed the popping WAY more than I should of.
I want to be the voss
DIS IS A SHIT

number 7 should have been Deathstroke crab
I believe in the pipevine Caterpillar because there was a beautiful butterfly by Annapolis on the apartment of quit water apartments
Why isnt anybody fckin talking that roger the roo is real!! Like come on people he is like the biggest evidance that animals are equally adptaple as humans
I already knew about the narwhal, star-nosed mole, and the platipus being real...its just hard to find them in their natural habitat since humans keep building or fishing (or hunting) on their territory. 😓
great video epic wildlife and list twenty five you two are two of my favorite youtubers of all time!!!
the weird shape on the cricket is actually a zombie fungi.
I've watched 2 videos, and I already love this channel
I watched the two headed shark movie and now to find out it's real... I'm never stepping foot even in a child's pool
number seven might be a chimera
What the fuck
whats wrong with the guy speaking first? down syndrome?
first time watching this channel. what the fuck is up with his accent? It's like some sort of retarded amalgamation of kiwi-aussie-maltese. I can't stand it - blurgh!
people didnt believe these exhisted  I cant believe people didnt believe these exhisted
#7 is a Maine Lobster not a crab.
musk deer's are really called Chinese water deer's tho -∆-
"amazing spider crab"... i c wat u did there....

LSP spilled her serum on the red lipped bat fish.
I have a narwhal tusk or horn at home
Nice fake accent
I actually researched and found interesting facts about the pink fairy armadillo ! but a poodle moth ? - i would love to touch one ahhh
I've never met anyone who thought that a platypus was fake.
WHAAAAAT?! NO OUTSIDER EVER HEARD OF A COCONUT CRAB?! bruh, where I live, those are one of the most delicious food. (I live in saipan north of guam)
I feel like grumpy is the wrong term for blobfish. They look more depressed rather then grumpy. That is just my opinion though.
That pig mutation...just wanna say the farmer should go on the Maury show.... you are the father!!😂😂😂
That poor albino shark it didn't stand a chance once we humans saw it. I wonder how big it would have gotten if left alone to grow.
the Halloween crab is a damn lobster you dumbasses
i saw this guy playing mtg months ago... ;)
Thought this was stolen from danger Dolan as soon as I heard the voice in the beginning
Wait. Did you say one of 50? So there have been 49 other animals that looked like a cyclops?
IM HAVING A HEART ATTACK
i will crush that number 2 grass hooper in a split second eew
Roger the roo looks like a man in a suit
for once they didnt have clickbait, no clickbait=less hate, keep doing this and youre bound to be a better channel
narwhal whales more like narWHALES
People still think narwhals are fake!!!!!!!!!!!????????
1:08 it's that owl from ocarina of time.
Does anyone else think that the spider crab looks like something from the dark crystal movie?
great list! no goblin shark though.
2 I knew that was real
It looks like a deflated turtle
BIG MEMTY claws!
1:04 he says "arnimal" instead of "animal" ...(-_-)...
Should-a added this one to the list: https://www.pinterest.com/explore/belgian-blue/
fmoi:im.thereal.mvp
blobfish are ugly as #&*% but they look somewhat normal when they're in the water
Doesn't that kangaroo just have that muscle disorder that causes them to become unnaturally muscular? I've seen cows and dogs with the same appearance.
The Halloween crab is a lobster
I love crabs, and Coconut crabs are my favorite! I want to see one in person :>
The Japanese spider crab is the reason why I will never ever go near to the beach ever again.
I'm surprised the giant isopod wasn't on there. First time I saw that I didn't even believe it was real
I gotta work out more. Fucking kangaroo ain't gonna make me look bad.
The moth looked like a Mini Albino Mothron/Mothra Like if you agree And also i think narwhals were Obvious already.
thank you fake kevin smith
just saying the blob fish looks like squid ward.....a little
that's not a moth that's Eevee's bug evolution
wait why is this guy trying to sound Aussie
No. 3 looks like the creature marlboro from final fantasy XD.
So dogs at least born without hind legs can adapt without artificial assistance? Cool! Didn't think their spines would let them.
one word: neopalpa donaldtrumpi
these creatures look real and maybe we never seen these creatures
What the fuck is the use of a soft shell on a turtle?!?!!
1:48 - The purpose isn't clear. Think you'll find that's actually a picture of the $30 hooker fish.
#5.....THAT'S CYCLOPIA. THAT MUTATION IS USUALLY CAUSED  BY INGESTION OF A CERTAIN WEED
Imagine stepping on number 17 holy shit
the halloween crab that you showed is a lobster.
Jerboas: or shaved a chinchilla
#6 can't be legit
I thought donald trump was fake but guess not....😰
narwhals narwhal swimin in the ocean causing a commotion...
No 7. called a crab, looks like a lobster
Pink fairy armadillo. Literally Sandshrew.
please for the love of good its AN-I-MALS not AH-ni-mals. shitted me for ages
I love how God designed a fish with legs that still lives in water and a turtle that has no shell but still exists :D Jesus is so amazing I love seeing the humor in his creations
I didn't think the aye aye didn't exist in seen one in real life
#7 genetic condition called Chimerism, it has 2 sets of dna from fully absorbed twin
the Cyclops shark is amazing
I knew 2/3 of this list were real
7 is a lobster not a crab
Who actually thought narwhals were fake? Is the thought of a unicorn existing so fantastic? pssh. please
half of these animals I never heard of
someone needs to donate chapstick to the squid
the guy is on channel frederator
Dogoroo in the Philippines????!!!So that's why I've seen a couple of those wandering around somewhere...

"Im just mostly eating or reading"...my life :-(
Guy in the thumbnail looks like Timberlake.
He got roasted by the kids in the end .
My Man in the Moon 🌙 😻
oh wow I thought that was JT in the thumbnail
"I'm mostly reading and eating" same. Same
This was awesome. Please keep doing these!
I'm starting to think that's actually his real laugh.. ya know when you hear a lie enough times? That
The kids are right you're not as funny since you've been picking on President Trump. You forget you have Trump supporters that used to like you.
Anyone else think the thumbnail was Justin Timberlake?
Kimmel 2015?
So happy those two little girls wanna be vets!!!
the sims music is the best
I honestly thought that guy was Justin Timberlake
i was waiting for a kid to tell him he's a joke😂
What's on the shelf? uhhhh... yes
One of the kids has a really low voice
02:03 More of those kids and the world is a better place
Jimmy has the best fake laugh
I thought it was Justin in the thumbnail with Jimmy so I clicked lol but I'm glad I stayed because those kids are adorable! <3
anyone else hear emperor palpatine when the girl said do it
I wouldn't call Jimmy Fallon a comedian.
He's great with kids!
I thought that was Justin Timberlake in the thumbnail.
may that one girl be the Wonder woman of all the hokages
The gymnastic girl!
Bad Kitty?...I've read that one before.  Gold.
I'm convinced 115 people have no soul or you thumbs down Jimmy? This is worse then when people thumbs down Sesame Street thumbs up 👍 for the kids
I would take my some to work with me... but he doesn't like golfing!
Kimmel is way funnier with kids
The man with the 2 daughters looks like Chef Atala.
Jimmy's really nice with kids:-)
'My dad's a gynecologist. He looks at vaginas all day long.'
Why does this video have mysims music
please tell me I'm not the only one who thought it was timberlake in the thumbnail!
1:25 is that Matteo from the tv show Jane the Virgin?
that was precious
Guys, @1:08 is not Justin Timberlake!!! He's definitely Luke Bryan the Country singer??? Has anybody ever thought the same way as I have?
these kids are so honest
"I'm just mostly eating or reading." SAME
2:13 jonah is me!
Even with children he fake laughs.
I legit thought he was Justin Timberlake

Me when someone calls me: "Aw not again!!!!" Or  I just ignore it and pretend like it never happened and text them instead
the sophistication when he said the name of author

Plz sub to me

I thought he was going to ask his kids
I want to adopt the little girl at 2:00. She's awesome!!
is it only me who thought that that was Justin Timberlake in the thumbnail
you should have brought your kids to work with you
Kids are so brutally honest. Poor Jimmy xD
Lol my sims video game soundtrack in the background 😄
"i'm just mostly eating and reading"
lmao is this the mysims theme in the background
lmao is this the mysims theme in the background
lmao kids are so precious
Jimmy Kimmel would have done a way better job.
1:53 When she's asked to do a cartwheel and before she can answer her sister commands: "DO IT!" :D best part
I thought it was going to be jt
wait.... is that a laugh track in the background???  what is this a 90's sitcom?
"i have nooo idea"
*Be honest, you thought that was Justin Timberlake in the thumbnail...*
Superhero, Mermaid, Rockstar, Ninja, Zoo Keeper, Doctor, and a Mommy.
i got timberlake clickbaited
"I am mostly eating or reading"... Dont worry kid...thats what I do too
I hope to raise my kids to think and feel like she does. ---> "A super hero, a mermaid, a rockstar, a ninja, a zookeeper, a doctor and a mommy" <3 They can be anything they want.
When that little girl said "uhhh I think a little tiny bit" it was too cute and so funny!! 🤣🤣🤣

"... and a monmy." AAW :D
"2 packs of gum" lol
Jimmy:Do you think i'm funny? Child: ummm.. i think a little tiny bit. Jimmy: Pleasure meeting you Me:hahahahaha
jimmy has a naturally funny relationship with kids  probably coz he's a big kid anyway 😂
Nice work! Thank you for putting this together.
I wanna make a movie where two people meet and they both think the other is all naive but it turns out they just don't have overlapping areas of expertise.
I've never even realized this dynamic between characters and the tropes... The childification of grown women to satisfy the male ego is so gross...
Sooo true, dammit!!
Please, someone add this to TV Tropes. It should be a thing, with how massively common it is.
This is so excellent
How the HELL is this not in tvtropes.org yet?
Holy shit this is disturbing
Outstanding video! I'm totally creeped out, but this is very interesting.
Briliant video! Thank you
Thank you sooooo much for this, this is exactly what bothers me about so much media!!!
this was fantastic
There's an actual name for this this now! So thanks for that.
I'm just waiting for those to bash this video like they would on the Feminist Frequency videos.
Great video man! I think an example of the genders being reversed is the live-action Peter Pan film from a decade ago, though it's not at all common.
I'm honestly shocked how this video never even uttered the phrase "infantilization of women" in which this trope is clearly a part of. Amnesia also commonly pops up in this trope.
Great point. This whole trope is super creepy. Loved your video!
This is very good, it's a concept that's always kinda bugged me but I never had a name for it until now.
thank you for making this
Anyone else find that sandwich scene kind of terrifying?  He literally intimidates her into eating food, which apparently is not natural for her species, and he looks and sounds ready to beat her up if she doesn't obey.
made me also think of the new TV show "Making History"
This was wonderfully and well said. Thank you.
someone needs to create a TV Tropes page about it :D
female characters are written so terribly in most movies/tv shows. they always have to be sexy, and they alwaaaaays have to fall in love with the main character.
Congrats on being mentioned in an AV Club article! I'm glad to see them recognizing your hard work :)
They wrote Leelu (idk if that's how you spell her name) beyond childish, they wrote her acting like a baby. It's so creepy
mind = blown
Mike and Eleven's relationship in Stranger Things. They even do the disrobing thing.
yeah! This is an incredible deconstruction and I really enjoyed the video
Super interesting, loved this content. I subscribed!
this trope is basically what drove me away from binging random anime because it's literally all over the place there but shit there are so many characters that fit i hate it
I wonder if there are any examples of this where the guy ultimately rejects the "woman" because of the traits that originally attracted him.
THANK YOU FOR THIS. this trope is so disgusting and terrifying.
Love this video! It's so good
In the age of the 3 min superficially-in-depth video covering deeply intellectual topics, this was a rare find. Thanks for this video and I look forward to viewing more.
This was hella good👌🏼 sort of eye opening in a way?
new to the channel, excellent video
George of the Jungle was the first thing that popped into my mind as an example of the reversal
Fantastic video essay! I'm now trying to see how old of examples I can identify of this trope. Miranda is The Tempest is the earliest I can think of off hand.
Teen Wolf's  Malia with Stiles ! Just outside the woods, shift human with a 8 year old mentality and bang pairing with Stiles in a asylum and making out and stuff, gross
this video is important and everyone should watch it.
Great video. Fifth Element is one of my favorite movies but this allows me to evaluate it from a different angle. I saw it very young and it will be interesting to see this trope now that I'm older.
As an analysis of film, this video was terrific. In my personal opinion though, it would have been much better without the opinion piece and political statement.
You sir, got yourself a new sub! Well done!
See that's why I can't stomach these kinds of movies, but wow seeing them all put together legit makes me sick.
I absolutely adored this.
Clever video dude, you nailed this trope. Liked and subbed. So much of society is ruled by male fantasy.
Very good observation..
Very fine work.
Pure brilliance!
Wow this was so good.
Man, this was a really insightful video! More like this please!
this is so important
I think this might be happening with Samurai Jack right now. It's similar, at least.
Fantastic video!
I haven't read all the comments but it seems like Wonder Woman's origin story can fit into this categorization.
This is so fucking important! Thank you for making this, now I have a name for that terrible trope.
I was so afraid this was going to be a 'men are bad' video. But it was actually informative and not shitty.  Thanks.
Her voice :)  she  deserves better  than this
It's one of the few catchy songs that has an import message that you won't get tired off
big ups for conscious lyrics,it's about time we take stock as a people
sounds like something in a Leon Schuster movie .....correct message but low low grade production
...that base-line.!!
Don't know what she is singing, but sounds good.
Thank you, FG beautiful well-balanced song and that voice Zolani MMMMM
It is a Banana World, folks! World is going bananas!
Thank you Freshlyground for protesting! Our country is worth so much and the present Zuma regime is poisoning the chalice and the well. Forward to a strong, ethical leadership. Rise South Africa,  amandla ngawethu!
Big up Freshly Ground! Keep the fire burning!!
This right here, is how many SAns feels, We are all affected and we have a role to play to change the situation
As good if not better than anything in the charts over here (UK) very important political message put across extremely well.. Great song! ✌️
THIS IS EVERYTHING!!!  Love you, Zolani!
this has serious No Doubt vibes!
Brilliant. Saddest South African song since 'Weeping.'
Awesome vid and brilliant tune!!! 😀👍 Never be afraid to say what needs saying!!
The Freshly Ground that I know is back, with a bang!Glad that Mr Zuma got your grove back guys.You were beginning to miss the plot!Can't wait for your live performances!
About time artists step out of the shadows and speak against the current state of our beloved country. Now AKA can shut up and stop kissing ass by defending the ruling party hoping to score all the gigs the party holds.
What an incredible an iconic voice this woman has. Unbelievable beauty
Welcome to Trump's 'Murica. We've reaped what we've sown. Sorry world. Payback will be a bitch to us.
Nicolas Maduro is a monkey president and his goverment is a Banana Republic
Great tune and video and so accurate too. Just another day in the Banana Republic.
If I was Candice Hazel Would be in hospital
eish poor candice
Mogadi was 14 when she got pregnant.. and her son is 14...so she's  28..yipee I worked out Mogadi's age..I'm a genius
what a good question john maputla asked to this nuisance they call meiki
Hazelnut plays it dirty again
this a total waste of 25 minutes
I want a lecturer as enthusiastic like Chef Marlene. One that gives you goosebumps about the upcoming work,the work you've done and make you anxious about the next work...making you disciplined and all
HEYYY!!!! Kat wa bana. mmhm
nare Mary wa tsenwa.
who is here for the comments..........? lol
In my culture what Mokgadi is trying to do is wrong.You can't take the child that you got before marriage to your new family
meikie's attitude is getting to my nerves nxaaaa
yes john its about time meiki looked in the mirror
Glenda is related to Ayanda
The bro-mence going on between Sakhile and Kwaito is too much
John finally put his wife in her place
I swear sakhile is the next lelo in kwaito's life.
Meikie Maputla should just grow up man!!!!
Yes Maputla...its simply the right thing to do.
i miss babymaker and lelo
dankie john.  today o bile monna.
and then why is Sakhile trying to steal Kwaito"s work? uyaze in SKeem saam no young person makes it without someone squashing their dreams.
makgadi's mother is hiding something
Sakhile is about to pull a Lehasa on Kwaito, watch and learn.
The Man of the house has spoken, meiki was fed the humble pie by her husband
So Mogkadi is 28 years old, his child is now 14.
Can someone please murder sis Ouma on her way to the taxi rank....this woman has a very big mouth
shudn mokgadi discuss al ths wth hubby first bathon..
Mokgadi is been unfair ka this whole thing, no maan she is too much now. Leeto must just leave her too much stress.
John Mapula is a real father I like it cheers
Mary is a weird mother,she's heartless
but Rachel gives me life tle....savage
but Rachel gives me life tle....savage
Maputla thank you for putting your wife at her place.
One thing I've noticed on skeem Sam is they always use one table at the restaurant that's in limpopo.
sis Ouma doesn't waste time, really good at what she does!
sisi ouma and thats what made this chick want emkay even more tell me how it burns and i'll stick my hand in just 2 c how hot it is
why does Mokgadi not discuss these major decisions with Leeto first before telling the family, it makes Leeto look weak
Rachel shouldnt be acting this way considering that she landed in that room because of Enhle
am i the  only one who skips kwaito and his friend talking  or sakhile and kwaito talking about the assignment?.
Do agree with Mokgadi's decision. of finging her child?
Going to lunch with mary matloga is always a bad idea😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
omg somebody please shoot hazel
Who goes to the bathroom without their phone?😁
yes john put meike in her place she to judgemental  as a parent.  no man i would have ho over to hazel nut an slap her for touching up my man like that
whose the girl at 11:00
I wish Candice was a black girl, Hazel wouldn't be playing these games with her man...
Emkay though, that nigga ain't got no type. Lol
emkay you are screwed up by sis ouma. candice consider your bf snatched
lol Mokgadi is also fueling the whole situation aowa
joyce maputla fake eyelashes so big you can't tell if she is opening her eyes or not
The way John likes Mokgadi you would swear it's his own daughter.. poor Leeto you deserve a better treatment from the woman you love this much..
but Mokgadi is wrong. she must first discuss all her issues with her husband
disappointing how skeem saam doesn't have Tswana speaking characters. Our people aren't represented enough on TV
sister ouma is too forward damn. mxm
maybe  I should  send u my CV😂😂😂
nice one JOHN MAPUTLA
Any girl whom her boyfriend... or any women whom her husband is like John Maputls please raise your hand. I wanna tell u something
why don't they finish the house and move out, deciding to look for her son and take him to meike's  house is a little too much!!!!
enough of the magkodi story!!!
No, Mokgadi this is too much now
But how did a man like John Maputla end up with Meiki???🤔
I have a feeling Mary will be in trouble if mokgadi's child is found
Mokgadi is such a bore
Can we talk about Mary's hair line please
Rachels room mate's voice is annoying
where's  Leshole and sir big boy?
joooh the way I'm hungry though! lemme go make food.
I think Moghadi has suffered a Mental Breakdown 😢
lol Rachel is me
Papa wa Leeto is the definition of a real man
Mokgadi's mom is really getting good at leaving restaurant tables lol
I'm curious  to see what kind of boy is he gonna be... I hope he is as naughty as clement #mokgadisSoN
So vele vele in Skeem Saam, everyone meets up at the same table?   Have you noticed?

The 84 people that went out of their way to dislike the video must all have smelly cooters. Why else would you click dislike unless you were butthurt about that.
Anyone of you guys still remember the old game "Bad Mojo"? ;)  That game did it first. In 2D and pre-rendered 3D though. It's on GOG.
How do they know Anthony and what does he do?

Hi everyone I just started a Battlefield Channel anyone got any suggestions for a Battlefield 1 video? who ever replies gets a shoutout on the video! (Dont take this a advertisment only need ideas!)
Roblox quality game
Cool game, i always liked the concept of playing a very small creature/human inside a house  where everything is gigantic relative to me. I wonder if there's more games like this, if anyone knows feel free to tell me.
Love the "sigh" at the end. Speaks a thousand words lol. Love you guys, keep up the great work.
If only they found out they could turn on the tap water in the sink and flood it to drown them
Glad that you try new stuff, but this wasnt your finest work. GTA Online series is gold though.
kids do not wach this 7:10
click on the video and looked up and there was a bigger roach two feet from me seriously I lost it and now I'm freaking out.  HELP!!!!!lol
oh cool turkish simulator

YUCK YUCK YUCK!!!  Hilarious tho!
How is that kitchen still around? It got blasted by a shotgun and should have burned to a crisp with your improvised flamethrower.   That guy looks like the mobile home guy in Harold & Kumar that drove the wrecker.
ypu guys lost a life in the beginning what happened
I'm sure if everyone just watched neebs gaming we would achieve world peace
0:03 NEEBS FACE REVEAL!!! Just kidding, but you guys always find some weird games to check out!
wish u could trap someone in microwave n turn on n watch em go crispy kritters lol    good laugh guys :)
At the end. Last few minutes. What is that song on the old timey piano?  I swear I know it.
This game should have been named Turkey simulator.

loved the video and love the game I have it for PS4 so was wondering if I could add you twiste
marking is bad they need fix it its just the timing to mark it
Can't believe we've got graphics like this in 2017
looks like a spectrum game
At the 6.11 mark, is that three or four sets of twins I can see in the crowd? For real!
fuck i wish ea made this instead
this game needs an update, AI are missing from 5 metres out! it is quite frustrating
i played you today and you rekt me using china lol any tips for marking? i seem to lose most marking contests even though i time it
What is the best camera angle??
Can you edit the appearance of your career mode player through your career
I get it next week Friday I'm in Adeline bullcrap
been playing all afternoon yeah the marks are really difficult to time, struggling to time them
Not coming to PC for a while yet.
I might get it tonight I can't wait
Carn the tiges
Do a player career
do you know how to mark on afl evolution
I can't wait to get it.  I'm so eager for this game.
i just got it
Going to the footy saturday Dean? GO THE TIGES!!!!
Keep playing the game
What do you give it out of /10?
Trash ass graphics especially for 2017
Hahaha this is about as good as an AFL game I played as a kid in the 90's. Don't waste your money.  Never going to have the development for a sport that's only nationally popular in one country.
Off the ball play looks like it needs a ton of work. Players not running through the lines and running to strange positions ie. to the boundary when cutting to the centre is the obvious move..
Post some Career
Is it better than AFL Live?
What's the difference between evolution and the other one (controls)
can't wait to pick the game up from EB Games in Wangaratta tomorrow
Why's Daniel Rioli so tall
I am busting to get all evolution
this looks shit
The marking and spoiling is so hard!!
Is the interchange system the same as AFL Live 2
Why tf is Toby Nankervis still not the starting ruckman!? Ivan Maric hasn't played in 2 years!
Can you switch the ball by kicking backwards
hey guys do you know if the controls are the same as live
Go Carlton blues they are awesome
The siren sounds crap, they should make it realistic.
Looks mad!!!!!
How did you get it early?
fuck, who would have though twistie did methods...
It comes out tomorrow in Queensland can't wait to get it 😀😀😀😀 looks so amazing
THIS LOOKS AWESOME
can you play online?
How r u playing it ?
we want career mode
Shut the fuck up and let us listen to the commentators and the song so fucking frustrating
Lucky man, I'm getting it tomorrow!
This actually looks like a significant improvement. I just brought it from eb installing now!
Play at westpac stadium in new zealand
hi mate what camera options are there
Hey dean ur you're awesome you're my favourite YouTube keep on doing it u legend
What is your favorite Real Madrid moment from this year?
Tapinaldo at it again
I would expect 1080p or higher in this era
Real Madrid vs Monaco....i know Monaco is down 2-0 but they'll come back home
Haha you can taste the salty-ness this channel hates Ronaldo and Real Madrid hala Madrid !! BeinSportsftw
Navas is too predictable how cant they score on him?
SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUO:
Boggle my mind why these same players get lazy when it comes to league games.
Real Madrid are good but can't beat Barcelona 😂😂 what a joke
Benzema suck they should put morata instead
I think both Barcelona and Real Madrid fans can agree that Atletico is a good to embarrass.
Come on Real Madrid lets win the laliga and the champions league dobbles
Come check out these soccer jerseys for sale! Chelsea, Roma, NY Red Bulls, LA Galaxy!  http://www.ebay.com/cln/garagesalehero12/soccer-jerseys/401235130016
TO:BARCELONA AND BARCA FANS:PLZ DON'T COME HERE AND HATE ON US (again)
Without a doubt, Cristiano is the best player today. What a performance.
Ronaldo just killed Someone's ucl dream again
Hala Madrid!!!
Real for the 12th!!! #HalaMadrid
This is what happens when they play 4-4-2 not 4-3-3
messi watching this game tv.
# 1 world class team real Madrid. No Barcelona or others.this is reallity.
real always real.
why do they call Ronaldo the GOAT?
I turned the game to Fox Deportes when I heard that stupid commentator again.
Shoutout to Bayern, who should have been here instead.
MSN couldn't get passed Juve's defense so I'm 100% sure Real won't be able to either since MSN is better Juve has amazing defense and amazing attack don't underestimate Juve
"Real Madridmuh, and even if you're not a Real Madridmuh fan". 4:24
Cristiano​ Ronaldo is the best player in the world.
can y'all bring bag the English speakers back :'(
You Real Madrid fans are plastic.
simply the best ....... ever
I'm a Barcelona fan but I have to say Ronaldo is a beast at finishing and goal-scorer machine. Congrats and I'm glad I'm living in the Messi-Ronaldo era. Amazing players to watch.
my favorite player is Ronaldo and u ??😃
100 champions league goals without the two offside goals but he is the G.O.A.T.
Wait these goals were not offside again were they?...
Congrats to the 2nd best player in the world doing what he does best. Scoring. (practically all he does tbh) No shade, no hate, just facts :)
I'm a Real fan but what does Messi have to do with this some of you guys are obsessed with him
anyone can score a penalty. ronaldo is in same level as peter crouch
I love you Real! You win, lose, tie, I will be a Madridista till I die! Well played!
Ronaldo is amazing
Ronaldo going to win ballon d'Or this year
I was waiting for a penalty .....
HALAMADRID TILL I DIE!!!
And people say messi is better haha that's the joke of the year!
Ronaldo is going retire after the World Cup 2018. One of the best I ever seen...
Champions league final. Real Madrid vs Juventus and Real wins 2-0
Top class from Ronaldo, Barcelona follower. All I can say is that I'm glad to be alive during this time to see both Messi and Ronaldo. Visca el Barca.
cant wait till ronaldo has his last few years playing as a st
If Real Madrid wins the champions league, fans will forgive the defeat against Barcelona
real madrid will win the champion league
Cristiano who? Never heard of him
QUE CHINGUE SU MADRE LAS CHIVAS!
best Madrid game!
Where the Barcelona fans crying about refs , offsides and Yellow cards at hahaha
it will be funny that monacos won the final vs real Madrid
If Ronaldo would have been in la liga since a kid like Messi it would Be over for Messi's stats Barca is lucky Ronaldo wasn't a youth product from Madrid 😜
Ronaldo FIFA 18 card shooting stats: Shot power: 96 Long shots: 90 Volleys: 89 Jumping: 95 Heading Acc.: 91
Ronaldo is the best all around player ever period end of story. He can do it all not many players have done that. If you know anything about football you know what I'm talking about.
where is pepe?
Ronaldo is amazing but why did he not do that against Barcelona
barca is better
Haha funny no offsides on the first goal. Totally rigged game
Fox Crew > ESPN
Colombian national team is by far the most overrated one of all time
Is there a way to turn off comments because its all about real madrid and barcelona and not about the beauty of the game ._.
impressive , props to cr7 from a Barcelona fan
The 73rd minute goal by Ronaldo was fucken beautiful
TSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Messi was watching the game on tv 😂👎
Didn't do that to Barca he was no where to be seen. Juventus gonna smash them
savitar is barry
I didn't know 32 was the new 40 smh.
La liga to brace champions league to juve Bpl Chelsea series a juve Ligue 1 Monaco Europa to man united
Hala madrid#
STOP COMPARING RONALDO AND MESSI AND ENJOY  
these Fox sports dudes are stupid
hopefully juventus wins CL i want to see buffon happy, im a madrista but i rather see another team win CL
im never gonna be able to see atletico lift this fucken 🏆! !😭😭😭💔💔💔
Real Madrid is currently the best team and Messi the best player.
Ronaldo: scored 2 hat tricks in 2 games vs big clubs. No big deal.  Messi: scores 2 goals in a meaningless game, takes his shirt off and flashes it at madrid fans.  Who said ronaldo was the cocky one???
Nothing beats a thick French copper pan with stainless lining.....if All Clad and Demeyere are the Ferrari's of pots then a Matfer Bourgeat is a Bugatti
How can I cook rice in the all clad sauce without the rice sticking or burning on the bottom of the pan. What temperate should I use because even on medium I get burnt rice
Mauviel copper pans come with a stainless steel handle too. And besides, if they wanted to see if they could find a cheaper alternative to all-clad why would they even consider a copper pan?
I love ATK because they're fun to watch and because they are from Bernie Sanders country!
Why do we want heat dispersed up the sides of a sauce pan?
why not using the Cuisinart MCP194-20N MultiClad Pro Stainless Steel 4-Quart Saucepan? which is the same price as the Cuisinart MCU194-20N MultiClad Unlimited and is the most similar to the all clad saucepan.
Bathong this not fair tota.Puleng's belly bouta pop now....Themba gotta go  pursue his evil tricks and obsessions elsewhere

Come on... there is not a sign of dust... the colors are still bright...there is sound and image... this is not a derelict theme park.
Derelict : in a very poor condition as a result of disuse and neglect.  , this park is far from being Derelict in this video.
I thought this was dumb and dumber visit Bedrock City! Nice bowl cut bud! Haha ...
Does he know that he's just filming himself most of the time? We don't want to look at him. He needs to turn the camera in the other direction. Please!
It's not "an abandoned theme park " if it is still open and maintained.
These are the Whitest people I've ever seen.
The fact that this place not only exists but is open to the public, albeit with just the statues and structures, is amazing. I wonder what other attractions Hanna-Barbera characters influenced?
you didn't go down the slide. weak.
Was the theater already running the Flintstone film when you got there? If so that's really creepy... it running continuously... without anyone there
Pumpkin pie hair cutted freak!!!

It doesn't matter if I'm an Arsenal fan, Hendo is clsss. I hope he'll score a plenty of goals for him.
Unreal, Hendo will go down as a legend in my eyes. Stay strong Andrew!
Imagine Henderson scores the 2017/18 premier league winner and goes and celebrates with Andrew. Would be amazing
Why have these invisible onions started being cut 😢
Love this. It's great to see players doing this like this. From a United fan.
Thank you Hendo for what you did :) You are just as humble as stevie, good luck mate :)

Can someone tell me why Soundwave wants the Decepticon Hunters ? I need to know.
Lol when they combined to ultra bee
How did they merch togather
drift shouldve been the left arm and sideswipe shouldve been the weapon sword...
what just happened to them 😓
surprisingly the combiner is rather realistic. I know rid doesn't live up to the show but its so well done for what it is. when you think about it the series is rather consistent with its plot and setting.
As cool as Ultra Bee looks by the scale of the show he's only about 5 meters tall. And if your american that's about 16 feet. Sooooo, yea.
I want to know why Soundwave needs the weapons.
Bumblebee and the other combine again in to Ultrabee
when can ultrabee battle?!!!!!
These minicons are pissing me off
thanks Angelina
this is awesome that they showed the problems of combining ..i used to wonder about that and thanks angelina
finally they can realise they form ultra bee
*who's excited for Deadpool 2?! If you're new to CBR, join us now for more list videos like this one! :)*
Deadpool never agreed to having his cancer 'cured'...
Wait.... MAYBE HE CAN KILL SUPERMAN
Living forever would be a curse. Not "awesome".
I think that professor X might be able to hurt Deadpool but not without having Magnito's help to upgrade Cerebro. Doing this could put Professor X in a coma.
He did get sick, he caught that techno virus from space.
Deadpool is so awesome
8:19  **looks at school grades** ... no...
Didn't trying to read Deadpools mind cause Professor X to go braindead once? Also, his immunity to psychic attacks has more to do with his cancer
This is just a info about Deadpool. Most of this shit you can find on a wiki.
You ed brain cells don't regenerate after a certain age
CBR u do realize a lot of the is wrong
Well, nice list, but you forget that he is super unproticteble.
I'm calling B.S. on the immunity to telepathic attacks. Telepaths don't alter your brain cells, they alter the electrical signals in your brain (in fiction).
man with deadpools drinking ability he would make tons of money going into frat houses and betting he can outdrink the whole house
I don't like Deadpool.
The fuck is up with this audio? It sounds like you talking in a cave underwater
wtf deadpool is australian
In Greek mythology death is the daughter of Hades so...
ya forgot his slow down time power
He also has a magic satchel that he can pull anything he wants out of. So he wouldn't need a gun bag
wait. deadpool and wolverine are canadian? xD
when Deadpool says he is from Regina Saskatchewan.  he's from the same place as me I live here
I think its his relative insanity that buffers him from psychic attacks, not his healing factor.
On the contrary, Deadpool is always sick, he has cancer also, 8:06 TRIGGEREEDDD
FUCKING SPOILER
4:46 But that doesn't make any sense
My friend want by deadpool
2:22 WOW, out of the 3 or 4 times i watched the movie, i never realized the dick crown...
When you're the only one here who hasn't seen Deadpool.
I had this in another tab and was about to watch someone draw Deadpool, and accidently clicked on this tab and was surprised to see it was still bout the deado of pools
does this guy know deadpool skin was caused by a fire and not the bs they showed in the movie
he doesn't really hides it
4 out of 10 were practically the same thing. WE GET IT!!! DEADPOOL CAN REGEN!!
There even is a story in witch another person lives inside deadpools mind
Dp is Op Af
Being imortal is a very big punishment as you will see the world die around you. you won't get to die when earth dies
Body slide by one.
brain cells dont die and regenerate. once they die they remain dead
if they chopped deadpool in half would he regenerate into two deadpool
CAN HE DIE BY AGE
Deadpool would have been far more successful if he asked were Ajax was. No one knew his name was "Francis".
in the comics, his friend dies, and their soul is put in deadpools head
I love Deadpool
this intro is not good or like a pro xD
I thought DP stole the TP device from Cable?   And then he broke it. ^_^
..why do you call it hiding More like just haven't shown us  yet
You said non-teleport he can actually teleport in the comics tho
I don't understand why deadpool is really serious and when he is fighting he Always is kinda funny
wtf do you mean?
this means that he is the best hero then every hero in marvel
kita!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Comic book versions and movie versions are two very different things. Make up your mind which you're talking about.
Well he already got cancer so he's kind of sick   all of the time
doesn't deadpool also have the power to pull out any weapon from tgin air?
he has s u per parkour
Deadpool can be so cute!
man, that stamina must CUM in HANDy (hint hint)
Deadpool kills three with one shot OH BABY A TRIPLE
if i dont subscribe to you nothings happens
i have question in the amazing spider man you see spider man getting the flue but why dosent his spider dna protect him?
you also said superpowers not powers you should know what non super powers there are and even non even a power just an ability
u said hidden, 4th wall awareness isn't hidden i hope there either wasn't another hidden ability so u brang not hidden pow or just that one the other one is there is gonna be another video
0:53 did you just call wade Wilson ??????????
deadpool is one of the top 10 strongest comic character and coolest character of all time
deadpool actually has 2 oblivious weaknesses  1. cremation (no cells left to regenerate 2. frozen in a freezer (all healing cells frozen)
Maybe he will steal a teleportation device from Cable in the sequel
nooooo... you said ajax... hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i'm dyinggggg hhhhhh
his magic satchel... y'know, the thing that makes him able to carry like 4 billion weapons at once
CONFIRMED: Deadpool's the BEST hero. Over Logan by a hair. Sorry, Logan, you're my hero from day 1 but you can't speak to us.
Marvel vs. DC, Deadpool Vs. The Flash. I know the flash has speed but Wade is pretty much immortal and I don't think Barry is. That would be an interesting video.
when he can live forever I think,he can wait for the cure for cancer o he cant take it =_(
I saw the thumbnail and thought; "No way! OMG! He has a wrist!? Wow!".
Brain cells regenerate? I thought they didn't, like with amnesia...hmm, gotta look that up again.
I think it'd be accurate to show characters with a Healing Factor *always eating,* considering all the calories they burn using it.
the metalguy os sp funny cuz deadpool killing like hundred guys and metalguy is ok but he didnt want deadpool to kill the asshole who gave him superpowers
thanos took his immorality away
there is a deadpool for every situation deadpool was, is, or will be in. So there's an infinite amount of deadpools.
wait... who would win in a fight? wolverine or deadpool?
wait... who would win in a fight: wolverine or deadpool?
what happens to deadpools other head when he grows a new one? Does it still have its mind?
duhhh deadpool has 4th wall break
3:19 either way we wont see him he would be in jail for kidnapping he got in to a car accident with the boyfriend of the girl he likes in the trunk
What if deadpool can't die because he knows the creators don't want him to die and thats also why hes cocky.
"Teloportation device" Mate thats not a superpower
I thought deadpool has a teleportation belt said the comics?????!!!!!!!!!
fuck flying I'm calling a taxi
u left out his super strength
Yeah, take away his immortality and the only thing that could kill him would be a nuclear bomb going off right on top of him, vaporizing him.
Still my favorite meta af hero :D
NO LO DUDO QUE SI VAYA GENTE A VERLA

Great animation mate, i am giving you a like, but next time try to work a little bit harder on the story itself. It's not bad, but it can be better :)

Good boy, Willy
My cat wouldn't do this :v
That wiggle butt! What a good boy.
I didn't know heart can be warmed to the point of breaking.

Out of the 10 gazillion dog videos posted on social media a day, one is actually worth watching !
Aww!! This made my day!
This is the reason why I want to have a dog.
warms the heart
dog is man's best friend
Press B to Blow
"I wanted to fuck Adam" - Max 2017
Love the Gaga reference! Queen of the people!
R adds an extra stroke too. You just kept adding strokes to your score whenever you reset just for time.
Could not ask for a better study break. Lets go!!!
*GOTTA EARN YOUR PEE*
Love the music in the background, if anybody knows it can you tell it would be greatly appreciated.
Hutch singing The Show is evvvvverything omg
wrong people in the description, for fucks sake max! also doing the same thing over and over and expecting different outcome. Max you should have stayed in school av little bit longer....
Hey Max hitting R looks like it adds and aditional stroke to the one you just took as well so essentially it gives you 2
If anyone is making a compilation of adam singing DMX - X gonna give it to you by cutting out various audio bites, heres 3:30
Stargate who remembers those 2 awesome shows!!!!?
hey max.  Richard dean Anderson did the star gate in the tv shows.
At least you got it into the pot of gold.
5:10 Adam try to hit Gassy
Hey Max, R resets you to the beginning, adding a stroke, F resets you to your last position. also adding a stroke
1:48 greenscreened straw :D
Max be like if it takes this much delta V to get from Saturn to Uranus then I can save some by skimming this bowl hole... Calculations flying all over the screen
NOOOOO just STOP.!  you're an embarrassment to men everywhere.
WTF. how did get HERE from flat earth vids. this shit is lame ass dumb fuck retard SHIT.,!!!  thumbs down
what is that catchy music Gassy has in the background when he plays this? its so calming :P
Some of these holes are straight up shit lol Most of them are just a trial and error of the strength of one stroke.
He does too little power, I guess? Not sure
Look at that 3 14s... you have 4 gassy...
You forgot to link Hutch? D:
I love this music.  Muzak.  Who cares, it's awesome.
This was a really hard custom map. Jesus christ.
lol, Max's straw is invisible!!
You actually suck so much
why is it possible that the videos volume goes from 0 decibels to 350 decibels in half a second???????
too be honest watching adam win is boring.... they should fuck him more
nanners wins again....big shocker.
HUTCH DEAR GOD it's "I'm just a little bit caught in the middle" if you're going to say it 17,000 times at least get it right D:
Description's fucked.
spoilers at the end he said he got 3 14s but he really got 4 14s
Does anybody know what the background music that's playing in the video? I've heard it in a lot of Max's videos but I can't for the life of me find it anywhere else.
Max kept pressing R, but didnt realise it was adding another stroke everytime!!!
8:04 Holy shit that was impressive.
Get closer to the ramp goddammit!
this is completely random but max's straw is invisible in his cup i just thought it was funny
Anyone else notice the green screen straw at 5:57?
Yay Firefly references!
Why did Max become suddenly retarded on the 13th hole?
Adam is an actual ass hole when it comes to this game
Am I the only one who just really hates Brian?
Adam acting like he doesn't know the map lol
It kills me every time Max has to do one of the ramps.
you fucked up the description.
Max: oh look three 14s  Me: you actually had 4 but ok 😅😂😂
Is this the HBO real sex theme song??
max would you and the other guys ever consider playing this while drunk.
lol your green straw was part of the background 😂
Why has Max been losing subs?? I hate seeing this
I miss the train whistle...
"I'm just a little girl stuck in the middle... that wood is dickin' on mee.." - Hutch 2k17: [25:00 and 25:09]
I love how you've been playing with a lot of the old gamers you played with a long time ago along with new people here and there it's so refreshing on both ends gassy. Love the videos and much support!
max video no work
Don't press R you fool it adds an extra stroke to your existing strokes!!!!
This is Scout. Rainbows make me cry.
can't tell if his intro got HD, or if I have good internet for once
Just zoom in and watch Max's eye squint when Seananners hits him at 7:59.  You're welcome.
Is that "prick" they keep saying an Uncharted 4 enemy reference? Lmao
Why can you be more like nanners when playing
Max, did you know that in this game, as long as the ball gets into ANY hole, it counts, even if its not the correct one for the course? You can cheat so hard in this game.... if you want to troll your friends. XD
wrong links and peeps in the description my maan
Like how do you fuck up so bad , you making make brain rage and want to punch and hit something as soon as i see you fail, please max practice get better , win a game for god sake
Anyone know the song name at 15:50? It would be really appreciated!!!!
Max pisses me off where i start to rage at my phone when he starts to fuck up like why cant you win one
I'm not screaming because Max keeps on doing the same thing that doesn't work. I'm not screaming.
The description fooled me into believing brian and smitty were here....
Next video max you should only use your Morgan freeman voice
maybe if you shouted James Spader or Jay Davidson you would have made it to the Stargate.
F resets you to your last shot, R resets you to the beginning.
you didn't put Hutch or Goldy in the description.
Watching people loose this bad is so frustrating...-
Just a note: Max, in case you didn't know not only does R reset you, but it also adds a stroke to your score, so only use it if you have to (not just to save time).
just came from a seananners outlast 2 stream :)
Never ceases to amaze me at how bad Max is at mini golf
maybe dont take a minute at every hole to just sit there doing nothing?
I faced palmed so hard when you press r. it still gives you an extra point
literally the definition of insanity
Did they actually know the rythem to a song from Evita?
15:15 No Max, that angle you were going for wouldn't have gotten you anywhere.
what map is that
I like the longer video.. more more
nanners is the living embodiment of the shiver on the back of your neck feeling
11:20 what is this whale doing on the stage
this video is whats wrong with the world

fuck the downvotes  bro. You owned your mistake and fixed it
Please don't breed.
Awesome video man, we have all been there, well not there but something else equally intelligent.
"you only need 3 brakes to stop" ok you have to be trolling everyone?
Cut the guy some slack assholes, everyone has done something boneheaded. Least the dude is putting in the effort to learn and do the work himself which is rare these days.
What a fucking idiot
This is what happens to the kids who grow up without a dad or a cool uncle. :( 😔
You spray paint your caliper red to look cool and can't even DO brakes. Ugh. Send your car to a mechanic before you kill somebody.
RIP this guy due to car accident
that rotor is fucked lol
Maybe stick to fixing iPhones rather than anything to do with cars..
Holy Jesus, please tell me this is a toll video.  You literally did everything wrong.  You are the reason people think mechanics rip them off.
What a god damn dingus hahahahahaha
i enjoyed the video
Damn. These comments are garbage as fuck lol
Please show me a video on how to replace my air-bags.
Those fucked up rotor surfaces will eat the brake pads. Have fun killing people on the road.
Nice dude, good to see you keeping yourself honest and uploading this for people to see. Ignore the haters.
There are thickness specs cast into most brake drums and rotors. Please for the sake of yourself and others sharing the road please do not take short cuts on brake work.
your should do the drugs after you finish a project not before
............and you actually made a video of this and then you have the audacity to curse God. You're really some kind of an idiot!
I just bought a Bugatti, will you do the brakes for me??........................OMG
wow he put them in back to front !! Just to let you know young man when you put your boxer shorts on the pee hole goes at the front.
BAHAAHAHAHAHAAH........
good video Dude. don't listen to the haters
Where is this guy from ... Nebraska?
wow omfg get off YouTube
you stupid fuck
Genius !! (you know the retarded buy meme)
I hope you are good with computers because you really are a liability as a mechanic!!!
If you have zero knowledge on what you are doing, don't fucking post a DIY on it man! Jesus Christ! Your going to kill someone! Grinding a rotor to "resurface it" ?!?!?!
Every fucktard is a backyard mechanic dispensing BAD advice
i think the best thing to do is just change the rotors and pads....cmon man its the brakes don't risk it
There really is a first time for everything! WTF just happened there?!?
Gzuz! I can't believe what I just watched
wow.. just wow.. not smart at all
Oooo! Another JJ Channel! Cool!
Good to see nature reclaiming the land. I wonder who owns it now and what it will become. It would be nice if it could remain as natural bushland.
Well done, thanks for the story  JJ :<)
The maps etc you got when you walked into the park when it was open.  https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0QsvN7GZbMyc2s2OXhUSHNuVjA  https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0QsvN7GZbMyS3BtUjZYcHZrUzA

that is a boxing turtles are all over the United States
I like the the solar boiler 🤓
Please tell us where to buy the item(s).
Subtitles say "Yes daddy pour that hot steaming water 😩😩😩" 7:21
you hit the stick with the axe 16 times
that's what she said wink wink
i love the colors of turtles
When you can only render this video at 480p 😭
I liked them all
You can also use the axe for a weapon
I would love it if you included links to the products you are showing in the video. Please please will you do this in future videos
I've had the alcohol stove in my ruck for years.  It is awesome.
Eastern box turtle
2:10 NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN!!!!!!
That stove looks like kids kitchen play set
you shold do the 24 hour challenge in the woods
Nifty Gadgets! Love the light best. Yet I would camp with all of the items. Ax was cool too!
9:35 its like a horror story..
These videos aren't really relevant too much for me, but this guy seems so genuine and nice person that I keep watching all of his video!
y ur hand always tingling
you know what you should do. you should tell us how a "paperclip" can be a weapon
can you make a video that your camping with mre and your camping gagets

mara who writes this guy's lines, the words that come out of his mouth!
Curry is pathetic.  Can't wait to see him choke again against Lebron then his sissy fanboys claim the refs gave Lebron the title, as usual.
NBA NATIONAL BORING ASSOCIATION. I use to love this game.And i use to enjoy every minute of it. Basketball sucks today.
Spurs vs Celtics in the finals. I'm calling it right now. Come back to this video and kneel before me once it happens.
0:43 ZAZA FIRST DUNK IN GSW? o.o
good win for the warriors..but seems like mike brown has a different line up rotation...hmm
Shit not even fair.
😷 these niggas be having open 2's still taking 3's how they gon lose.

Warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the finals 🤣🤣 #Chokers
6:02 6:03 crossover by iso joe on the chef.

I Love How these bandwagons call 12 points a blowout
2:13 watch the travel
Warriors = Gogeta  Cavs = Vegito   Lol
Zaza finally dunked in a life time wow.
Posting rape video again?
You guys do this thing, where the winning team is in the thumbnail doing a highlight. could you change this? I like the suspense lol
t. r. u. m. p. 🔜🔜🔜terrorist  ..
Imagine if warriors had ibaka for center or cavs had him for powerforward
Damn Stephen beard gotten sum length since the last time I saw him shii💯😭😂😂
how to gamble in nba play off pls pm me
4:31 give this guy a maaap
At 4:28 Gobert goes out to check Curry at the 3 point line.  Curry proceeds to "shake and bake" him!!!! LOL!!!!!!
No one cares about the Warriors beating the Jazz. Okay some of you do, but I don't.
*Playoff Win #5* _32 assists on 40 possessions, who does that? THE DUBS that who, they are now 5-0 in playoffs and 1 up on Utah_  https://plus.google.com/u/0/collection/ojaJ3
Good win considering Warriors had to play 5 on 6 last night, since December 1st, Warriors 0-3 at home when David Guthrie referees, 31-0 when he doesnt
Dave Chappele MVP on that game !!!
Curry is one of those guys who sucks draymonds,durants,iquadala, and thompson dick at once.
George hill playing like ass
I missed it. Just had ribs finish in the Q when I dropped a knife on a major artery.
oh hi...how are you gobert!?
27>27 Never mind the center with the number 27> the other center with the number 27...
I really wished they played the clippers instead
5:58 Curry got dropped, That's all I'm concerned about. Funny how the commentators didn't even mention it but when Curry do what he do they say something. Typical NBA.
So easy so good? No Warriors are playing TOGETHER! This is basket-ball!
Damn , Steph made Gobert hit the dance floor at 4:29.
1:43 sadding Skinny
Knew it was over when Zaza dunked 2 minutes in
D West's passing is crazy, love when he does that
Klay looks happy..for now.. the L is coming pretty soon bandwagoners xD
Warriors looked a little bored, gave a c plus effort and got the win...This should be short and sweet.
Can we just fast forwards to the finals already?
4:29 stop that curry that man has a family!!! lol
Gobert had the loudest 13 pts. From the highlights looked like he had 25 lol
too strong!!!
Compared to any other team, whenever the Warriors win they talk the most shit, worst fans in NBA history.
Utah looked lost at times. Hayward didn't know what to at times. They shut him down. They play good D
Dave Chappell at the game!!
Jazz Are The Number 1 Defense?!?! UMMM I See Players Wide Open :)
utah winning all home games just a warm up game dont sleep trollers and trolletes
2017 NBA champs.
draymond is one hellava basketball player
The Jazz has to steal one in the Oracle if they wanna win the series. They need to expose the small ball the warriors are playing
WEST: GSW vs SA EAST: CLE vs BOS
corry sai yumaa
Damn it Jazz in 9
these niggas are too good man
this is gonna be another sweep.
utah wasn't ready for all that offense
Guys...guys....its the jazz calm down...

Hey Dr. Matt. are those your favourite jeans? I noticed the wallet fade 😋.
I have a questions that sounds maybe stupid: Is ist True that Cats don't like it to drink where they eat? Srry for my bad english it's not my common language.

Why do people flag this when there is clearly a warning now most of what your seeing is interdoce the dog and say what's wrong  with it and show the end of the surgery and the video is over  not fun
probably 4chan flagging to show how autistic YouTube is.. Double edged sword guys fuck off
can somebody please tell me wat the symptoms of worms and parvo... if anyone No's please tell me thank u..
wait is this the same guy that has the demolition ranch channel, is that real and is he an actual vet AND is he really allowed to record a surgery
Is your wife a vet to?
I just got this Australian Sheppard and he's covered in ticks and won't let us pick them or anything any idea how to help get rid of them
Dr. Matt has a definite Tim Tebow vibe going on.
she's so gentle... Awww I need her in my life 😍😍
Ohh dude, you're cool! You are not only able to hold arms in your hands, well done!
It appears that Magpul do not ship to the UK, which is a pity. There is only the option for within the USA. Could this be changed please?
dear YouTube... you are fighting a video that has over a million views... fight lost.. sincerely Jairus. PS... nice try.
How is pretzel
I have just started watching you and really love what you are doing and keep it up
this nigga looks like a Boxer
What could I give my dog for motion sickness? She always gets sick during car rides.
My name is Abbie!!!!! and I had a toomer in my knee.
I dont like that boxers tail gets cut off, btw, you're an amazing human being
I have a boxer and he is the best dog ever and I would love to adopt him but you live to far away
I am glad the dogs are getting help but the last fifteen videos have been about dogs. What about cats? You saying there are no hardluck cat cases at the shelter? Just saying.
and sorry, one more question, what did your grades look like in high school? just want information from a vets perspective.
Better question, what are the requirements of becoming a vet?
I have a question, I'm not in high school yet. But if you have a 3.0 GPA what are the odds of you being a vet? I really want to be one when i grow up, so I'm just curios. Please reply! :D
the family need to exercise her....
Hi I found a stray kitten in a dumpster and unhealthy what do I do he is about 5 weeks old
why would someone flag these videos? Some people like to learn from these surgeries and find it fascinating.
R.I.P nipple
I've only seen your demo ranch videos and who knew this whole time you were a vet. You are a very complex person.

unu a gwan like seh a kartel personally upload the song with such caption . Dancehall is all about controversy
watch ur mouth uth u chat a little bit too nocare Gaza nation
dutyberry watch it mouth uth
She too hype. this will humble her
Most of you guys don't know what it's like as a creator to have something stolen from you! That's like you painting an awesome artwork and someone room all the credit and sold it for millions
sheensea bring life to the song wah do unuh. the girl never own up the song kmt
I think it's all about money. You don't pay the teach for his music then the teach will show your dirty colors
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
weh di bag a chattingz and dissing the girls, she out line already seh it was an agreement thing.
The shenseea version will sound better to some ppl because they  already familiar with it.. so its an innate bias.. but if u listen to the song good good.. u will realise it nvr need a feature
she never give the boss no ratings from day one she know what happened.
dwl she stoles it real good 😂😂💀
some bad business happen between Romeich entertainment and Vybz Kartel /  adidjahiem records...so this is the results //'/*_
dwlllll Berryyy..you are the best...Always something going on in Dancehall🤣🤣😂😂😂😂 my spirit never tek r from day1 .lol
this nigga is afraid to talk so he don't lose his Gaza fan base 😄😄😄😄 speak yuh dutty mind bredda 😅😅😅😅
people really fool shenseea stated it's a so unique song and she was asked to do the verses!! she is talented..Jamaican people too bad mind
Same duttyberry love to "collab" more
still love the colla
shenseea version sound much better
Granted I really like the collab version... but right is right...
this is totally shit!

Dear NBC, you still dont get it, do you? We thought you'd learn your lesson. But you're doubling down on your propaganda.
they are actually really scared of american
Who cares if they flee?   Good riddance!
thanks for exposing a weakness in the border security between Canada and America so the enemies of both countries can exploit this weakness with their nefarious activities
Canadians sound like us about our border!
This title is why nbc has earned the title FAKE NEWS.

Dammit that all just ugh dammit
It took me three weeks to notice that I was literally RICK rolled
i feel this edit would have been better with that drumroll to end the vid. fair use ftw :)
Oi..... I cannot believe I got rick rolled by a fucking network....
Rick Roll aside, this was a clue to when the next episode would air-April 1st.
I can't believe this! How could yyyyyou

Did we got Rick Rolled? where is the music at the bottom tho?
I'd rather just be Rick Rolled... where's that amazing 80's backing track!
Rick rolled
I just got Rick and Morty rolled.
I never realized they spent so much time struggling with "you" in the show.
This is legendary
liberal asses
THESE SADISTIC PEOPLE ARE KEEPING DATABASES, TAGS, AND MASS INFO ABOUT TRUMP. IF WE DID THAT TO ONE ANOTHER, IT BE BAD
put pressure on north korea. sure. fuck militant clinton. fuck trump. what happened.
Full sentences maybe, but so many blatant lies and distortion, she is still being investigated and should be in jail for what's she's done.
"There's truth to that. There's truth to that. You look there's a certain openness".  This is something straight out of the an SNL sketch. lol.
Hillary and the DNC are to blame for Trump. Her arrogance, ignorance and vanity know no bounds.
Omg yes absolutely,  only an absolute moron would vote for an uneducated for the job narcissist, problem is,there seems that there are a lot of self absorbed idiots out there, so here we are.
The USA really missed a great opportunity by not electing Hillary Clinton!
OMG, the whole world is watching, i really do feel a yuge embarrassment for you americuh.
Hillary Clinton is literally the only candidate that was so bad that she could lose to Donald "We have to take out their families" Trump.  #Berniewouldhavewon
Butcher of Libya.
Trevor Noah would not have a career if it wasn't for trump winning like all other failing liberal media
Hilary thinks North Korea would negotiate on anything? Wow she is retarded.
Trump is a donkey, he don't run my country 😌
Liberal media at its worst
Donald Trump is president, get over it snowflakes
Don't forget that her sentences doesn't end with [unintelligible]
Vent of a Woman - lol
Can't tell if Trump is wearing a tie or a bib
A woman president ? Sure, just not this one.
You think Detroit is tough try being in boarding zone 5 (faaaart)
i does cant get enough of his videos it shiub be 30 minutes long  love when he talks bout trump ah weak
That's the ticket Name Hillary ambassador to North Korea We can give her the same security She gave to Bengahzi .
now you are the fox news and you are boring
To be honest, whenever I see a clip of a trump interview I skip it. It's embarrassing to watch. I do prefer Clinton's actual knowledge, we don't need soundbytes, we need a president.
Trumps interview was so painful to watch. Aouch!
Sanders all the way baby!
Russians Russians everywhere eh dems? lol
You don't need politicians to be entertaining FFS. They're POLITICIANS.
"Wah Wah Wah! If only you could've won the election even though you technically did win the fucking election, Hillary!"   -_- Whiners.. Who likely voted for Trump.
Her ghost will be in the 2024 election!
She lost to Donald Trump. Why anyone would listen to anything she has to say is  mystifying
Great so let's just allow people to carry on voting for candidates based on what the way they say things rather than what they are actually saying and never challenge that. No wonder things don't work.
#neverHillary -> #FeeltheBurn
iPhone's explode to...
Trump is an insult to human intelligence and a disgrase to mankind. Period.
Donald Trump is a Road Scholar.    He is out there with chalk writing stuff and drawing really big, like tremendously big drawings of .. what is that a horse? maybe a house? A powerful submarine named Ron?
it's well known that the Podesta's email leak was from the US, not the Russians...what a crazy bitch.
I miss Jon Stewart.
Fuck Trump, Fuck Hillary, I want Bernie. Even if i'm not american.
I think Hillarys biggest mistanke was to focus and put light om her rival and light om her skills
She has "a private and public opinion." That's why she lost.
Is it just me or are Trevor's jokes falling a little flat since his break a couple of weeks ago?
Nope don't agree with you Trevor.  I am desperate for some predictability!
i don't support Trump. I think Hillary should have been president. AND I also think Trevor Noah is not funny. I really think he tries hard, but he's just not funny.
why won't she just go away?
Well Hillary is a seial killer by proxy, but at least she doesn't sound like a fucking idiot, just don't cross her
you will finally understand what you're missing after its gone... or maybe after being led by an orange buffoon, for America in this case.
Does the new Daily show only try to make hilary look good? totally walks over the corruption claims against the DNC and always victimising her....
Lol you get the politicians you deserve America .. best of luck
I don't even like Hillary BUT what the fuck. ...Trump's so thick
How dumb do you have to be for a G. W. Bush quote to go over your head?
This is so sad....cause it's true
Trump in the Oval Office- ohmygod I'm crying😂😂😂
*need glasses activate!* actually both samsung and iphones exploded during that time period. Samsung just did it first and more often.
I'm only about a quarter of the way in but so far he's ignored all of the substance and just gone for 'Hillary sounds nicer'... yeah... how'd those arguments work out for you last time buddy?
If only she talked this way all the time, instead of screaming all the time
You mean the mails that showed the kind of corrupt Wall Street puppet that she is! Why the daily show doesn't put Bernie anymore. He is not just talking he is doing.
Is this travis noa?   The cocksucking leftist traitor!
Stop blaming Russia Jesus Christ Hillary you just blew it...
The American Boris Johnson
So it looks like all anyone has to do is lob metaphors at Trump and watch him tie himself in knots . His stupidity would just compound itself :D
i just started feeling sorry for this cunt.. donald...
interesting how she's shown more personality in just this interview than in the whole election
Can you make these videos a bit louder?
Hilary, an intelligent , driven and successful woman. Trump, a sexist bigot. It's hard to tell why the average American couldn't relate to Hilary.
Trumps intellectual depth compares to the intellectual depth of a coat of paint. SAD!
Donald Trump is the living embodiment of an ice cream headache.
Funny, you have a buffoon as a president ... yet your country is running as if it never happened. Someone else is ruling your asses.
Metaphors and jokes are lost on people with dementia.
oh yeah, wow! ...but what was in the emails? ah hum... yeah... DNC corruption!

it's private soo...
episode and season
Haha I can't believe Roger is so insecure about his skin
Poor Steve That guy probably Kicked his ass but he couldn't because he's Leg less
you fuck up the title
he's dancing the moves from call me maybe in just dance
gutsniff to thea curve
lol, how did i not see this coming... damnit Roger xD
I'm eating Lifesavers while watching the scene, no joke.
i died when the dad grabbed steve
The only way Steve can get some is by being a Cuck.
How did Idubbz get in this video
Oh my god Steve got her pregananant!!!!
What's the disco song?
Ha! I don't blame roger for not telling steve.
Figgus got her pregnant
This was one of the dumbest subplots in the show and Jenna was one of the worst characters ever. And it was so goddamn annoying the way she said Figgis. That dragged out tone trying to make it funny was fucking stupid.
Roger's fucking dancing is always funny
Steve likes getting Cucked.. wtf is wrong with this show
Roger was at his greatest in this episode! Absolutely loved this. Laughed so hard at that dance with that serious Steve grin
That daughter of a bitch
to help her to have the baby
Roger is a dick
I swear Roger was gonna say you need to kick that bitch in the stomach
stop clickbait in your stuff you will get flag down
I love rogger
What a cunt. I can see why her boyfriend broke up with her
The most Accurate episode to life, the girl likes you once an asshole gives her a baby lol
Ellie kemper voices the chick in this episode
When you pay an impersonator to get you a girlfriend... that sucks.
Steve always gets girlfriends who are way taller than him...
7:00 Okay, go and have fun raising a baby with a future dead beat dad.
You need to kick this bitch *sip* to the curb *sip* pronto *sip*
Fake title asshole.
why can't they just have the abortion?
idubbz? that you?
1:16 OH NO its Jewel She still looks like a grown ass man
I feel like Roger is American Dad Quagmire
Roger is such a petty bastard and I love it
Roger is the biggest asshole Seth Macfarlane ever created
What season is this?
he looks like idubbbtv
what season and what episode?
American Dad is the only show that can get away With showing on-screen pedophilia.
This is rather typical, girls slut around with alpha douche bros and when they get pregnant they rope in some "nice guy" beta male chump to take care of them.
Steve needs to get real and find a nice girl he keeps going after the shallowest bitchiest sluts in the school. Too bad things didn't work out between him and Debbie.
Now I'm in the mood for lifesavers
Steve's head looks like a flacid penis.
Roger and Stewie dancing together=pure gold.
I WAS EATING LIFE SAVERS WILL WATCHING THIS
I like how Rogers calmly asks how she's doing.
What episode was this from again?
I didn't know idubbz was here.
He be screw boy
Name of episode
is Roger making out with a teenager. -.
ROGER SHARED OMFG ROGER WILLINGLY DID SOMETHING NICE THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH FIXING A FUCK UP!
"You need to kick this bitch to the curb"😂
7:00 Ungrateful, selfish, easy bitch. (triggered)
when Father doesn't want the baby someone else steps up
the football kid got her pregnant not steve u retard!!
Remind me why he felt so obligated to help this dumb skank who instantly dumped his ass?
Is that Idubbbz?
His head is disgusting 😷😷
I want to know that the repair or buying new lamps cost they nearly break a lam or two every episodes
roger is holding the phone upside down.
Steves roger costume is so godamn funny
Could have just pumped & dumped. She did through all the blame on Steve.
I would have stayed with her, a baby ain't a big deal.
I FUCKING HATE ROGER
i should report for clickbait.....but ill play nice
Steve is always undressed
that girl is a bitch
fuck the title Steve did not get her pregnant
*LIFESAVERS!*
The dad's voice is the guy who plays the voice of the extras on family guy
oh god its all happening so slowly 😂😂😂
That Just Dance that Roger did 😂😂
steve didn't pregnat her  she said about the football dude

"I must stop him before he does something tragic." She might be referring to Viktor? Possible pulsefire skin for him?
Caitlyn low key looks like Talon Widowmaker.
much better than pulse fire ezreal :p
0:50 chewbacca is that you?
How you are doing the dummy like the champions
trash skin for trash champion
Hmm i wish her hair would not be so dark blue and she should get her hat back Imo. Edit: The rifle is too big too but its a very nice skin
league becoming overwatch
Still prefer Lunar Wraith Cait.
With this pulsefire have multiple armor stages? I only saw one occur in the video.
In my opinion Lucian skin with green Laser bullets would be the best skin ever
I like caitlyn's hat :( that's like her significant look :( and they remove it
so cait can have a gun -motorcycle - chair but graves can't have a damn cigar       oh, wait....
the sniper when fired reminds me of a FPS game
is she the female ver of Chung in elsword? the gun reminds me  of overwatch
Where my Pulseblade Riven, Rito!
aaaaaand take my money riot
A pulsefire team would have been 100x cooler, personally. Just imagine that.
Finally a good skin for cait
the gun reminds of dragona sniper class
This skin simply has more personality that PF ezreal and for that reason alone it's superior in my opinion.
Sanctum 2 anyone?
Still waiting for Omega Squad Veigar
I was about to say this wasn't worth it, but for 1820RP I'll have to give it a serious look. The Pulsefire theme always makes me assume it's an ultimate skin.
Lame portal effect. Its showing another dimension, different from the rift. How come that she was warp to the base when the portal is showing a different place? You could have done better RITO.
Its no that her weapon is a bit oversized..
Every big skin release just gets better and better each time... when will the madness stop
I get a Borderlands feel out of this.
reminds me of WW
Remember when Riot said they wouldn't made more skins based off ideas already in use by legendaries  Because I do
what an ugly skin
WoW... Thats... A M A Z I N G... o.O'
the fact that they can make a skin this cool for a pure auto based champ means theirs hope for future skins
Pulsefire Vi would be cool too ;(
Eeey that Rocky Horror Picture Show reference at 1:27!
Destiny sparrow?
They forgot the boobs.
These pulsefire skins remind me of the Timesplitters series.
Borderlands Caitlyn more like, AM I RIGHT LOL illy
That Ult like the Dragoon item in SSB/SSBB is so cool
Still waiting for an Yorick death knight skin, 6 fucking years waiting. Whats the point ?
THAT ULTIMATE EFFECTS LMAO, LEARN FROM IT, EZREAL
Holy shitt wut a sking!
GIVE ME THIS SKIN RIOT PLSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
its so cool that her fun turns bigger when u get ult
does the ult screen effect apply on the enemy aswell?
thanks RITO now there are going to be feeding pulsefire caitlyns in my game.
the recall pretty much ruined the skin overall
Where is the hat?
Why the hell is always kata killing the character?
Widowmaker's skin into Ana's cape... Stop stealing riot
We have some ratchet&clank thing right here, and I like it!
Giving me a Star Wars vibe.
missed opportunity, it could have been so much better. not complaining thou more money stays in wallet
i don't like her gun...so heavy ^^"
Destiny futuristic motorcycle 0:50
I was an elemental Lux support main, guess i'm now a Caitlyn support main.
Really?! Another fucking Caitlyn skin?!
Boom. Cranium Blast.
Reminds me of Sacred .... (Backport)
Still waiting for puslefire luican!
Oh No! Caitlyn started playing TF2! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!
Badass and all, but Caitlyn without her hat kinds of takes away from her character. they should have added a really small, clown sized hat at least.
please dont make it gemstones
hair color feels a bit too jarring imo
I don't like how that Q looks
A SKIN FOR YORICK WHEN????????????????????????
1:26 OMG i love this reverence "It's just a jump to the left" good old classic...
The only this I like in this skin, is her death animation.
If you call down the thunder youd best be prepared to reap the whirlwind
It doesn't "wow" me, you know?
am i the only one who thinks that the ult on this skin is a lot easier to dodge?
More Caitlyns feeding the enemy bot lane in ranked, thanks Riot
1:27  and then a step to the right put your hands on your hips and bring your knees in tight and its the pelvic thrust that makes you insane LETS DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN!
Nova is that u?
tfw a Legendary Skin is better then a Ultimate skin.
I love the hair :)
I guess this is a princess Leia tribute
shut up and take my money
PLZ NEW SKIN KARTHUS AND SYNDRA
"It's just a jump to the left" was just me or that is a big reference to time warp? 😍
Rito is out to take my lunch money again :(
its a nice skin but they can do better
Actually the coolest skin ive seen so far in this game

I made it by myself. I used woodprix woodworking plans for that.
Haha, and what if you cut you penis with the electric saw ?
I don't have a penis
instructions unclear, got dick stuck between two planks.
I thought this was something serious i was looking for real instructions then I realised who these guys were  and now I`m like oh yeah sure
I followed the instructions, but my bookshelf turned out much smaller! why is tat? :-/
Im sure you may build it too guys. Just look for woodprix page and build it too.
Thanks to Woody Hyezmar’s plans, my younger brother found it very simple to finish up his first woodworking project. Google him!
Great place to learn how to make it yourself much much cheaper. Just google for 'woodprix' website:)
what if your, you know, is bigger than that board.....I mean, am I the only one?
I really want to learn to build stuff!
Hey Bob, i've gone and cut my penis off and put it on a chain and kept in my pocket. Really helps with those hard to reach places.
If you stop the video at 1:13;14 you will see a uncensored frame of his dick, have a nice day !
You guys should totally do the unclog a toilet episode next! I don't care if it was just a joke. Make it happen!
Bob nearly bobbed little Bob while making his cut.
Thanks to the two of you to teach me how to make a bookshelf. Really appreciate your effort. Stay tuned Bob and Bob!
Instructions too vague. Got my dick caught in a ceiling fan.
pls more of "Bob's Workshop"!
Small guy lol 
what happens if your a girl?
I thought this was a serious video until... I'm scared now.
HA HA HA HA HA FUCKIN BRILLIANT NICE 1
I'm glad I don't have to work next to this guy and if I did I definitely giving him a tape measure
NONONONONONONONONONONONONOONONONONONO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!   NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  -FFM
Oh.  So that's what rudetube is.  Why the fuck did I search it?  Dear lord you people should not be refrencing that on youtube where you can find any age of users.  Fuck you all, now my cat is scarred for life.
Hammer with wood and it's all good 
I've never screamed "NO" so many times. 
DUDE!  hahaha
I know it's fake, but i cringed when you cut that board, haha.
lol...this is crazy....what shiz am I watching
I never thought of this method. Thanks bob
This shows what twisted and sick individuals are running around loose these days.  
What the...hahaha
haahahahaahahahahahhahaahahahahaahaahahah
I see now that Kevin is into Little Bobs and Bookshelves.
Kevin are you srs
Note to self: Never look at Kevin's recent activity.
The fuq Kevin..
I lost my "bob" while cutting the board...
children will be proud of him...
Lol i swear i really thought this was going to teach me how to build a bookshelf in a min n 21 seconds! this just made my day LMFAO! 
Oh, aah, uuh, so funny made me feel little light in the head. Thanks Bob  o/
My thoughts: 0:02 "Bob is pretty cute" 0:20 "YESSS! Great video. Best video"
Bob the builder, can he F**k it ? Bob the builder ...yes he can ! ;)
Well that escalated quickly ! 
this is what I get for choosing the shortest video on how to make a bookshelf  fuck it, I'm going to Ikea
Cuttie little bob. Is that a 3 or 2.5?
I can still see it, does YouTube seriously believe this is "censorship"? I mean it, why even use the little blocks?
ohh fuck that's funny
"The hammer is my penis."  -Captain Hammer
is he using his real penis? not sure if prop or not
It wasn't clear enough... I got my little bob stuck in the neighbor's fence.
This is a joke right?
I would make a bookshelf for my GF if i had one :/
Why hurt me eyes?
Ladies and gentlemen, that was the Imperial measurement system at work.
If that saw slid that would hurt  
By the way, YOU ARE SICK!
Uhh...no just no! That's just not okay!I hate this channel. I'm getting out of here. PEACE!
I honestly thought he was going to slice off his bellend with that saw
That saw part could have gone so wrong lol. 
Sort of this counry's short life because of shit like this worthless YouTube video - congrats.
i dont see somebody sucking XD 
thumbs up for the Little Bob. ROFL
OMG!!! This sucks
XD what the.....
Wait, WTF??!!! How do you make the brackets?.....
this was too gay even for me
Is that a....REAL BEARD?
Small penis ! xD
Holy crap ew
but can he unclog my toilet?
lol i wanted to know how to make a bookshelf....this was so pleasant to see!!!
I was not expecting to see this
this is disgusting
I was actually looking to make a bookcase.  Did not expect this at all
I love penis, and Bob's got a nice one
Thats shite, mine has a laser level built in to get the bookshelf straight on the wall!
What an asshole... 
wow disgusting. he really likes to play with "little Bob" by himself and enjoy .
Wait wat if the wood had a splinter and ur using ur penis.
This guy is a god for me
well done ladies #teamjamaica viewers check out this video too https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MimVg0OMGvA
Shelly Ann destroyed the track
So Flo jo records maybe be gone  off the books in a year base on the IAAF new proposal to get rid of all records before 2005
jamaican women anchor, only ET & VCB deserved to be an anchored
where are all USA elites. no in 4x4 or 4x1
Wha is the difference between Usa Red and Blue
Princess Elaine.....gonna make USA miserable
Elaine Thompson a mi General!!!!! Saw her in person and Penn Relays! She is so MAJESTIC!!! Mad respect for her!
Elaine's technique is so much more superior to the rest of them
Elaine Thompson is technically the Jamaican wonder woman. ⚡⚡
Well done Jamaica, this wasn't the A team, it was mix of A and B, some are not at their best some are still developing, these is wise of Jamaica management. You get B competing as runners develop differently
i don't know what's the big deal frankly, but it isn't as if this was the USA's true A team. Not even close.
come on people let us celebrate these lady's for the hard work that they are doing a win is a win dis is wat bring out the best of them it call compitition it make it excited an make u won't. to watch it more
come on people let us celebrate these lady's for the hard work that they are doing a win is a win dis is wat bring out the best of them it call compitition it make it excited an make u won't. to watch it more
Thompson will be a fucking beast this year. Leaner and meaner.
Thanks Daniel, I don't remember her ever running a bad relay leg, she always solid.
a we still a win.
Listen! it is JAMAICA VS THE WORLD not the USA... we are the sprint hub of the world
The final exchange between the J'cans was almost a disaster,but in the end the pure class of ET made the difference,super run!
Jamaica to di worrllddddd!! This is wat shld hav happen in Rio. They shld hav make Elaine anchor di dam race.....
Jamaica to di worrllddddd!! This is wat shld hav happen in Rio. They shld hav make Elaine anchor di dam race.....
Elaine on that last leg.... WoW!! It huh pretty... but it look good.. 😀😂
As a matter of fact if she was on the Relay team last week the outcome would have been different.
Johnny, I specifically said "relay runner" Kerron has always been solid when placed on a Relay Team. She has not looked anything close to her 2008 form for a while.
compliment should be given to kerron steward and elaine has done a good job as usual. christiana does not show any "wow" so far and gayon still green. love jamaican team. humble yet very strong
After  listening  to  the TVJ commentators at champs and have to listen to these idiots its depressing
now that's what you called fast, that last leg though..."so great"
These commentators..smdh.
Good job Ladies
Yes Teach, would love to see her get back to her 2008 form or close.
This is definitely Elaine's season!! It seems like every time she touches the track it's gold!!
Go #GIRLTEAM!!!!
Kerron is a consistently great relay runner just like Michael Frater was. Great job girls
this is the good that can come outa jamaica if di youts dem go positive
up up up she is super woman
Elaine was like, 'Girl, not today, not to-rahtid day.'  On another note, English Gardner scares the crap out of me...and that's not a compliment.
add super mario 3d world on wii
A-a-am I dreaming? Is this true?
I don't get the point, why would I want this, if I got Nintendo switch
what is the music in video
Where are the speakers ?
When did they stop making games for my Gameboy Advance? :(
I want it so bad bud I hope they make some sort of deal like they had for mario and luigi dream team themed 3ds
je suis un grand fan !
Meh,still sticking onto,my new Nintendo3ds xl ._.
So getting this. Looks like a 3ds XL. Nice size and screen. Mad cheap price. What's not to love?
For someone who only has a Nintendo DS, no 3ds no dsi etc. I think this is my calling. It's cheap and I can play 3ds games can be played in it. (I'll be able to witness the 3ds experience)
Sooo this is the new 3ds without 3d? Is it faster? Cuz i just bought the NN3DSXL
Finally Something to entertain me while I dont have a switch
you should make 4ds vr
WTF still no right analog stick like the left fuking retareds
i have to pay to play online ib this console?
wow  glad I waited to upgrade to a new nintendo 3ds since this a thing now I guess  cheaper and will have better battery life, only at the cost of having 3D? SOLD
this might be better or on par with the Nintendo switch i mean it is gimmickless it has a wide variety of games it has reversed compatability snd free online the only problem i see is region locking
Just just release a bloody switch for Christ sake
Nintendo make another fire emblems game for the switch please
damn Nintendo back at it again with the 2ds
preorder Ever Oasis and Monster Hunter Stories at best buy
preorder at best buy, with gamers club you get free shipping plus 20% in all new games and it is for 2 years
I hope there wont be any "new 2ds" games only playable on the new 2ds xl
hey Nintendo you know that thing you released called the Nintendo Switch? I STILL CANT GET ONE WHY ARE THERE NONE AT ANY OF THE STORES
Nintendo? What is the point of having the 2ds a non foldable device but when you make an new xl version it's foldable. how much will it be in UK and when will it release
Sooooo, basically the New Nintendo DS XL? not 2DS?
So here it, ladies and gentlemen, the NX!
As anyone noticed that there is no camera on the back of the 2ds xl
I'm not into handhelds but I REALLY want this. I haven't had a DS since the very first one.
I'll probably get this once it comes out with different colors
To people who are confused, need I remind you that the GameBoy Micro came out AFTER the original DS was released?
what a the point of 2d?
So basically they're releasing a New Nintendo 3DS without the 3D Feature... Ok.
When it's gonna be out pls tell me I really want it 😺
I want a That New 2Ds XL
Seems like there's a bunch of whiny people in the comments lol
Just when I have a normal 2DS, they make an XL. #2DSRUINSEVERYTHINGEVENTHENINTENDOSWITCH
oh nice, they made it like a ds
It releases on my birthday
Still probably cant get it :(
i wonder if i should get a nintendo switch or the new nintendo 2ds xl
nintendo actually made this?! i just bought a 3ds xl
Why Nintendo?! We just got the Switch. You don't need anything else. Just let the Switch gain some momentum!
Is it cheap?
10 of 10 awesome I'm getting it
all the charge battery is red expect for a few
i just tried to bend my 2ds1regular in a way i did bend it but also broke it btw why would they release it when the switch just came out
the top part looks like a phone, the 2ds looks good i would trade in my 3ds for a 2ds.
so.... its a downgraded 3ds xl?
it just seems like anything that comes to mind they make
who here still has the original 3ds as there main 3ds?
I needed a new 2ds anyway 🔥
I have a 2ds, 3ds and new3ds. I actually like the 2ds because of it's gameboy like feeling, so it kinda makes me sad seeing its successor having the same design like the rest of the 3ds family :/
Nah it's ok nintendo, you can keep your upgraded 2DS in your headquarters... But us as consumers, we would love more NES classic edition... You know something that would make you guys money? Don't you like money? Mmhhh
the best console would be this but with games like ark survival and gta v and stuff with built in capture cards. i would legit pay so much for it!
I sold my New 3ds xl for the Switch and I'm so glad that this is coming in July! I'm definitely getting one!!!
I really like the design of this.
Bruh you just released the Nintendo switch
it could've been another new 3ds model no hate
How about telling us when we can buy a Nintendo Switch without having rush out and pre-order it before scalpers buy 15 of them?
Are those extra trigger buttons  I see? Now it'll be like a full controller
I thought they were going to stop making 3ds games?
i'd get it if it was cheaper like the 2DS was on launch. Don't really care about anything else.
looks promising like a  budget freindly 3ds
looks great! but... its awful at the same time...
They made the new 3DS a switch and now the 2DS. Whats next the New nintendo switch?
Not seeing why you wouldn't just pay the extra 50 bucks for a nicer 3ds XL...
Before Nintendo goes making more consoles, they should focus on actually making games for the ones they already have.
Why would they make something new right after making the nintendo switch???? CMON THE NINTENDO SWITCH IS BETTER!
they where smoking crack if the expected to sell this to me for more than 10 pounds Hahahahaha
Can they make it so you can play on the switch  and use it as another controller pls!
Great! Another fricking thing that I'll ask my parents for and they'll just stand there and laugh at me!
(faceplam)i just wait  for 4ds......
Can somebody please agree with me that the design doesn't look good
It would be nice if I also got the far more impressive orange and white, and Dragon Quest Heroes New 2DS XL options that the superior Japanese are getting at launch, NoA. Thanks again for no options whatsoever.
I already got a switch but somehow Nintendo gets me to want a new system that's less powerful..... HOW NINTENDO HOW??!!
o-o I LOVE IT !!! I want this !!! Nintendo I LOVE IT !!! Great Stuff!!! ;)
I expect Nintendo in this generation to develop a HDDS by now, to at least eliminate the jaggies with aa and higher definition graphics, cmon! my phone can perform waaaay better -_-...
1DS HAS ARRIVED
the 2ds got 2 million views 😎
wasn't the whole point of the 2ds for it to be flat? (2d s) Duh
Must ask, Is this better than New Nintendo 3ds XL?
Switch and NEW 2DS ??!!!! Realy ???????????!!!!!!!!!!!
So you listened to my idea about making a new 2ds. Nice nice. Now all you have to do is make Legend of Zelda Maker for the Switch and we'll be good to go.
I'm not going to get this I all reddy have a new 3ds XL

Stop doing tech vids. You suck at it. This is not your space. Go back to doing cooking and make up tutorials.

You're so hot and sexy . . . . . . . . . Not you Justine THE GALAXY S8.
the s8 is mostly my dream phone of all time , it looks so great

Been 8 phones and no stero speakers what kind of upgrade is this getting tired of samsung time to get a 7 plus or oneplus 5
I have samsung galaxy s5, but I want iPhone 6
Paramore died today for me, you were really good... not anymore.
this actually really good 😊😊 not like all the other bands that were better in 2009
Im the only one who can hear <<these nuts>>?! (1:40)idk why..😐
You're in the top April songs on our channel!! Paramore
theme anthem in college
ITS SO AMAZING
I love this song
Paramore Ft. Daft Punk
This video has 19 M views and I am proud to say that I am responsible for 18 Million of those views. I love this video so much
This totally reminds me of Sia in the beginning, who's with me?
this song's text is my life!!
bow wow wow rip off
Reminds me a lot of Neon Trees songs from their Pop Psychology album. Good tune, strangely familiar.
Why does she look like ashley simpson
THEEESSSEE NUTS
I fucking love it
No matter what the genre is, I still love their music :D
@vloggery what do you think of the "new" paramore?
her dancing is everything
Paramore now sounds like Paramore and Maroon 5's baby
Can not get enough of this!
the chorus is soooo good ... forget that the whole song is sooo good !!
Taylor at 0:50 is me all the time
it's Paramore?
is it just me or does it sound like the 1975 just me OK
This song gives a happy misery feeling :)  Love it
Give it as if you think Paramore is the best band in the world
Paramore is Back!!!!
I'm a Parawhore
This would be so perfect in '13 Reasons Why'. Who agrees? 💖
No one noticed the props she tossed to Blondie in the video? Love this girl!
She looks so different with blonde hair!
Who else is actually loving the new paramore era?💗💗💗💗
Their new songs are repetitive and musically boring with no development between choruses, no climaxes, and no thicker textures. They're all the same at this point with almost identical melody lines.
i want to see this live!
Emo pop-punk rock ballads or B-52's 80's pop, whatever man. Frankly, I would listen to Hayley sing the dictionary.
I love you Hayley :x
Loving the 80's New Wave vibe!! =D
love the new wave feel on this new stuff
The 80s pop sounds fits so well. I love this song.
just ft. daft punk please
damn she looks.amazing with blonde hair
wow I enjoy this new style of music from you is just amazing
this is first time I see hayley white hair
Oh my god, this is the best song I've heard in a while.
0:14 i tought it was a dora the explorer's theme song
Hinoooooooooo
I fucking love this finally a band comeback that I don't hate
love the retro vibe of the video
*When you're stranded on an island in the 80's*
O FUCK MY PUSSYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!
Her dance moves are so adorable! Haha
hayley looks like taylor swift with better looks this time
some severe talk talk teas!
the reason why i watch this video many times is the cuteness of hayley when she dance
its sooo diferent, but i like it, its fun
okay but the intro to this song seriously reminds me of Crash Bandicoot...not saying thats a bad thing lol buuuuut its just a bit of a game changer to the song xD
welcome to the 80's
The band looks like siblings and the 2 male members are just following what the sister says
This is my jam
This made my day to know that a new album is coming soon
from what album?
Hard Times & Told You So on REPEAT
Represents my time at school right now. Stupid exams. When I come home I listen to this song. THANK YOU PARAMORE!
What a cunt
these lyric describe how I felt in 6th grade and how awful people treated me that school year.
QUE WEA TE PASO CULIA
PARAMORE IS ALWAYS SO FANTASTIC
Haaaahhhaaaahhaaa this music is so fucken bad and worthless that is hilarious and sadly funny hhhhaaaahhaaa😂😂😂😂😂
https://open.spotify.com/album/79VQJpJQWcBHaH9jTjIlqP
ahhhh its so 80s! i love it!!
Haley looks so Beautiful with her hair like this. She should of been had this style.
Who's here before FIFA 18?
250 views are mine ;)
O my god this is awesome song
never been a huge fan of paramore but im loving their new stuff even id yall are salty
So jealous to those who have tickets to the UK shows. lol
"Some of us have to grow up sometimes. And so, if I have to, I'm gonna leave you behind."  - Paramore to haters who can't accept their new sound
This is just like sia - you've changed
It sounds very 80's to me...that's not a bad thing. It's very different, but not at all in a bad way.
Where is this
Very good video !!
How much do you think it would cost to run for a full year including all the little things ??
PARECE LA INTRO DE NARCOS
OZUNA ERES EL MEJOOOOOOOR  LIKE SI ES VERDAD
he seems to be addicted to music
Can anyone please tell me what happens at 3:33.... suddenly I felt like awaking my inner dormant soul..... to conquer the planet 😍😍
Will become a great producer one day.
Yoshiki vibes
HE IS 32 YO HE LOOK LIKE SOME 18 YEAR OLD WHO AGEE'S THOUGH
kinda disapointed, its cool but, he mostly used epic sound from his thing to make ppl crazy, and his playing was nice, clearly not a finalist for me
It was good. I was invited to agt last year. Should have went but had to pay for the flight. I have pianos covers from dragonforce to blindfolded covers!
Quality.  Piano needed some tuning but real quality all the same.
Fuck. He is 32 😱
i need a hug pleas can someone hugs me ???????/
playing the piano with his eyes closed just shows the passion he has to music!
oh my God this guy is so humble i like him
how is this any different than playing an electronic organ?
when he was asked his age, he should have said Washington
can I find it on iTunes
2:28 INTO THE VIDEO HE STARTS PLAYING, DONT WASTE UR TIME. SKIP.
so who are you /// well i grew up in a shithole i was broke all my life and i was dropped as a baby, how you win this shit is 50% sympathy 50% skills lmao
I love you! Do you remember my video about you? : )
subscribe to me lol!
Where can I buy his piece of art ?!!!!
we have found our new mozart
Can see myself listening to his songs on spotify
Wow... U are so good,  that it's sick!!!
2:25 it starts if you want to keep replaying it....
lyrics= hmmmmm
i just love that blonde guy at 5:09 😂 he was like yaaas bitch slayed my life mmmmhm... 😂😂
The song he's playing is Clair de Lune, just sayin'
no one pressed the golden buzzer for tokyo -- what a  travesty
I just love how he started his audition with Clair de Lune which is my favorite piece!
everyone that like this are ratchet people who like clubbing and techno music
sounds like Chopin in the beginning there
He is SICK! hope this gets released as a proper track
I thought it was tokio hotel cuz I only saw the tokio part
ILLUMINATI HAND SIGNAL AT 3:20
Never knew Young Thug could play the keys like this, dayum!
I thought he was wanking for a while
did lil yachty and bob marley have a son? tf
He made a great great build up in his writing! Using the old and the new type of composing music! Great job men, and the passion!
I like him.. I even move my body subconciously while hearing and watching him play.
i'm gonna build a wall between mexico and usa. bitches
Piano players are always so overly dramatic in their motions
I did not expect it it was amazing😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇
omg wow!!!!!!!! first I was like no then I was like omg he has talent😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇
do you morons realize 300 years ago composers were doing more original creative explosive stuff than this
that's  bloodstream by ed sheeran btw
BREATH TAKING
What do you mean speechless they clearly had a lot to say
4:23 .. 5:10 truly feeling it
Seem they were doubtful at first few keys.. turns out to be tremendous ..maybe it was too early for a golden buzzer?
What song do they use when doing his backstory
A nigger that plays piano.. fake unless he has one white parent other than that niggers can't play the piano.
ad block is just so good
What is this beat in the intro video. not the performance part but in the intro video or at the end with judges comments
Gosh goosebumps all over my body the moment he starts playing xD
he's good literally fucking good
shit i cried it was that good and i judge piano skills like crazy. *adds to favorite list*
he played with emotion and simplicity .thats it no fancy thing but just heart to heart
He should have gotten the golden buzzer, LIKE THIS IS REAL TALENT
What is the name of the song at 7:00 min ?
learn 2luv it....
learn 2luv it....
There's the soundtrack for GoPro: 2017 - A Year in Review
Poppy is there sitting
some one maka this into a look asap pleaseeeee
Honestly if I was the judge I would've just gave the golden buzzer      To the piano like honestly where's the tuning it terrible 0/10 shitpiano even mines Better *takes out violin*
BOI I played Claire de lune when I was 11, fur Elise when I was 9, and  Bach invention 13 when I was 8 what is this? he show cases well, but no Talent whatsoever...  Dat easy for asians
They should make a movie out of this!
I dont see people critisizing his piano skills, I only see people critisizing the people critisizing his piano skills.
Meh. If the judges were speechless, then why did they all have something to say?
can he please make a collab with alex aiono and william singe. ITS GONNA BE LITT
my friends...he has created PIANOSTEP!!!! Well done to you sir!!!
Blackguy: you can tell his nervous. and im like wtf he just said it himself..

Ok ok i was pissed when daredevil was postponed, this made up for my anger!!!
MOON KNIGHT?!?!? WHAAAAAT?!?!  2:25
Too soon.  Too soon...   Sorry, Marvel, I *really* want to like this... but I can't help but wanna puke a lil' in my mouth every time Danny Rand opens his mouth.  Other than that... looks great!!
Sweet Christmas!!! Claire and Luke finally got, some coffee!

Yes, please!
only really here for Jessica jones, luke cage, and daredevil. iron fist is just meh
Here for daredevil and Luke cage...somewhat here for iron first but Jessica can get lost 😴
Too bad I couldn't finish any of those shows
I've been waiting for this, I watched all of their shows separately
If your a boy subscribe to me *ATTENITOIN* If your a girl like this comment  O let's play that  Russian game every 5 LIKE has to sub to me *ATTENTION*
They need to replace the actor that plays Iron Fist...and the fight scenes for Iron Fist need to be like the footage we saw of the old Iron Fist during the series
Who can just appreciate this as, they're all coming together!! I loved all the shows, and yes iron fist was my least favorite, but I still enjoyed it nonetheless,
Come as you are always seems to fit perfectly.
COME AS YOU ARE!  *sniff*
August?  You've got to be kidding me... I'm all out of shows to watch on Netflix.
WERES SPIDER MAN
Matt Murdock: Jessica Jones stop talking  Jessica Jones: Who the hell are you?  Matt Murdock: I'm the only one in this room who hasn't had sex with Luke Cage. Yeah I hear everything.
This looks awful. :(
goosebumps!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;)
I like how each of their color schemes are continuing in this show. The beginning with Jessica is all purple until Matt walks in through the red door wearing the red tinted glasses. So cool.
Oh look, it's Serge Ibaka @0:57
I'm totally erect and dripping, niiiice!
Ripley and Bishop back at it again!
I am watching this mainly bc of daredevil
When is iron fist gonna wear that gear from the recording in one of the episodes

weapon room and bedroom
I can't believe that out of 2000 comments, no one said anything about how you spelled whose incorrectly. Who's is just short for "who is", so your title literally says "who is house is better".
MAKE MATT DO A DROPPER MAP PLEASSSSSEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!
0:50  Jesus?
Googly eyes will win
instead of doing regular door ways in your house make them hobbit door ways.
Googly eyes house is better
Matthias's house is better (Googly Eyes)

Paul's house is better
these serie is my fav now it's amazing fun and funny I wish I can play it like  that I'm so jealous but  it still fun to watch
you should have kitchen, beds, anchant men room,training room , stairs , garden to grow food, weapon room  a room that you can keep your wood and metal, houses that connect to each door  to keep anybody safe,
i think googly eyes' home is best
ATM,Paul wins
MATTHIAS? ok
that was Jeff at 0:42 or 0:41
I have ideas for both of you. Paul:Make a loft,a dungeon(to trap Matthias in there)and a secret passageway. Matthias:Make a bathroom,stairs and a fence around your house.
hmm... ideas... hmm... maybe tables, chairs or something like that :) also don' t forget to put a proper roof :D well, i mean, that i know what hobits house looks like, but, just an idea :)
#GOOGLYTOWN
spiders won't attack in the daytime
Make room for armoury,enchantment ,kitchen and a living room with some iron golems
You should make these rooms: -Master bed room -Guest room -Bathroom connected to the master bedroom -Bathroom -Living room -office  -kitchen
Matts is better
Goodly eyes
im a minecraft gamer and grian fan so i can say that your house is horroble
You should do something in minecraft for team edge gaming like a build battle or a fight or something like that
Her name is Charilze te-roan ( thats how its pronounced) shes a farmer girl with an Afrikaans accent who trys to act american in movies lol why😂 and btw stop butchering her surname, its not theron lol
Ellen is like calm through everything I dont GET IT 😲
ok this is not suitable for daytime show :D
omg it's the guy from my favorite movies I love youuuuuu
he suits for every movie hes hyper king and best :)
dont let this distract you frm the fact that general grevious blew a 4-1 lightsaber lead to obi wan when they fought on the planet utapau
Not true vin, your kids could have seen the pacifier xD
WTF how is he so charming and funny in real life but so god damn boring in all his movies
I will offer my services to you Vin to settle the 'dead fish' debate. x
His voice and laugh 💞😂👏
you lucky because you get to see Wendy and not me he's cute I'm glad you talking to him
RIP Paul. we Miss u
Ellen pls be smart nd be humble
charlize theron is a south african
that mother fucker seems like he would be involved in a pedophile ring
that old fuck needs to disappear the nigga thinks he still XXX
You don't come on to Ellen and get compared to a dead fish - that should have gotten way more credit than the audience provided.
OMG I love Vin <3
Who else agrees that it's impossible to watch just one episode of Ellen?!
He's too cute.
Oh so that's why he didn't do the second movie. I thought it was a money thing
thats Daddy 👅👅😊
Is it just me or has anyone noticed that any video Ellen posts you're able to comment but the video that has Kim Kardashian says comments disabled. hahahaha.
Oh boy I love this guy
It's wired to him be like this it funny 😂😂😂😂
stay off the reefer vin
He is gorgeous ❤
I loved how vin reacted to that Charlize Said i like more movement in My men
The fate of the furious was not like the actual series the fast and the furious
Why is dory talking to Vin Diesel
it looked like ellen was annoyed but hes pretty cool
i looove groot
I watch that movie is so good
why could his kids not watch the pacifier
That lady always plays the crazy lady in her movies what's up wit that.
And that is what you call- #RavennasKiss...
1:02 Little bit up himself.
Phonetic: Te-Ron
dont believe in sequels....make triple x 3 -_- love you vin but that was kinda funny
Why is his voice like this
Did he just take credit for writing the movies? lol. He was definitely a producer though. hahahaha.
When is Vin gonna come out?
Who else seen Ellen's ice flash?💎
WHAT IT'S COME ON GUYS DO I LOOK LIKE A DEAD FISH
I'm so sick of those movies
who else thought it was the rock untill they saw the title
I just watched the fate and the furious yesterday omg I don't want these movies to end they need to keep making more ❤vin diesel❤
Sorry, but Ellen is NOT funny and has no talent.
He is not a fish
I so want to meet him 😍😘❤️
when he shot up yelling "what" all I could hear was "I AM GROOT" ......Jusy too stoked for GOTG2!!!!
Waiting for tomorrow to see Katherine on the show
When Charlize Theron kisses you, you kiss back dude!
uh did he forget about godfather, back to the future and star wars
3:14 guy in orange shirt looking around like why am i here
so genuine. love him
elevator boots 2"13
ELLEN IS A FAGGOT.
Lord have mercy!
gonna make damn sure they keep making billions...cuz If you keep Vin, Dwayne, Ty, Luda, Jason &Michelle...I will keep watching!
Yes, you do look like a frozen dead fish 🐟 💀
the fast and the furious films aren't just classic because of it's endless sequels they are classics because they give us the unthinkable which hollywood tries to avoid most of the time
You know the rumors of him being gay? Yeah they're true lol
who else is on an Ellen marathon
Vin Diesel always be lickin his lips in interviews, ma bois lips finna get so crusty you'll hear him smile
He reminds me of tony from survivor
I went to see it today
Can't wait for the next one
Go check out the channel The Irish Leprechaun's Leprechaun cuz they are so so funny I pissed myself laughing at them
Since you guys are too scared to say it.... Vin Diesel is a Douchebag and negative person
Obviously he wasn't passionate about kissing her. ANyone who saw the movie would know that. Why Charlize would say that comment is beyond me. Blonde moment ? or busting balls ? Who knows
Fast and the Furious died after the fourth one
I watched it twice
come on guys do I look like a dead fish. the crowd is filled with women.
i love the fact how they kept the comments for the vin diesel episode but disabled them for kim kardashian.
lol, with that ammount of $$ i could buy my dads house back from the bank 😥
Is it just me or Van Diesel is really silly!!
its not fast and furious without paul waker
so AUTHENTIC, I don't see this alot coming from celebrities on a show like ellen
hahhaah ... proud to be a punjabi
drama name please
subscibe me please
i like two dramas bin roye and dilagi very near my heart
very sham full
Those two token black woman in the back loooool
Very well played by Trump...
fuck this crying babe peace of shitt
Can't wait for this to be made into a song. :)
He is so insecure these days that he surrounds himself with his supporters whenever he can... The campaign is over, why is he holding rallies?
Tbh I still can't believe this hippo became president.
redneck rally trumpet is a dick head
wow. The KKK have finally ditched the bed sheets.
Loool he's been at the last few dinners and now he's bashing it hahaha
All people who voted for him are fat fucks
"Away from Washington Swamp" he says yet Soros has his son in law in his pocket,hilarious 😂
Does he actually do his job of being a president? What a dick
Someone shoot this dumb cunt
Isn't that the correspondent dinner you have paid to attend previously? Oh how you wish it was different
Trump a dick but in all fairness the media aren't much better
sometimes i think i've gotten over it but every time i see him i lose my god damn mind
What's he doing? Can- does- what does he think this is?
This man really think he's super smart not attending that dinner doing nothing but going to rallies talking into a mic for no reason
what a ginger prick...
I hope he dies he is such a peas of crap fuck him
An orange turd floating in a sea of retard
Woo hoo TRUMP !!
But didn't he decide who went in the White House and if they are so bad why hire them
this wwe? they boo when he stops talkin for a sec, next it will be "whaat" lol
The man who is constantly on holiday and golfing. What a joke. His followers will believe literally anything he says. Pathetic. Same old swamp lurker
This is the president...
Look at all the nazis in the background. All uneducated white people. lol
Seeing this sex offender makes him a complete wanker! #DonaldTrumpWantsToBangHisDaughter
Hmm deleting comments, Hillary must run this channel
0:50 "without the president" 100% proof trump is either terminator or robot
Communists must die. Socialists too.
bow down for Trump the Great
I'm gonna vote for you again Mr. President! #MAGA
women for trump?
fuck him   and all his supporters.
Trump 2020!
The lack of critical thinking hurts
As a UK citizen: Trump fans- your country looks like a joke to us, and the rest of the world. Yes, we're not doing so well, but you should know that the *world* does not support you.
If Trump's supporters will cheer this on and not see through the bullshit - They'll support Trump through anything. Here's hoping to us all living through the next 1000 or so days of Emperor Trump.
Why is he still campaigning? Someone tell him he won. 😡
Wonder how much they paid the token black man to sit there.
Youtube comments 😅 Not one sees the day of light and yet you all still write on a platform that does Zero about real problems. Fools! And yes im writing this on youtube comments !
Fuck the media  Fuck Hollywood  Fuck Silicon Valley  Fuck Wall Street  Fuck Washington   TRUMP 2020
Don't know if I should like because it is Trump, or dislike because it is CNN.
What an utter fanny
I thought WH stood for WorldstarHiphop
Senile fat old crybaby
How come you guys cut out the best part? I'll just say it:   *"CNN SUCKS! CNN SUCKS! CNN SUCKS! CNN SUCKS! CNN SUCKS!"*
So much better then that Muslim bombing all of his jokes. they were so bad, it was cringe worthy
He's just immature and spiteful
my god the dumb americans which support this idiot truly deserve him.
We The People vs the democrats!!
I support  America  and  our  President  Trump  MAGA
We all know why Donald trump is fat..........because the orange does not want to be a cannabbell
"without the president"  Because you didn't have the balls to go?? What are you trying to achieve with that statement?
How does his hair/tan possibly look worse than before? I thought it couldn't get any worse 😱💀
It's pretty funny how petty Trump is
Lol its like seeing the crowd at a NASCAR event.
Why is everyone so negative, I mean I know Trump has his faults but most of you people said he would destroy the country on his first day in office...
Best President ever! Think about it he's still making the libs cry after a great 100 days of Making America Great Again!
I can see Trump saltmining Inc. had discovered another source, this comment section!
This KKK meeting was a little different to what I'm used too
Why does it look like he's running for President he is PRESIDENT, he should be running the country not chatting shit.
he's not a man of the people, but he's a man for the people. if you like him or not you can't disagree
This is just like a wrestling promo, I love it.
I fucking love Donald Trump much better with his supporters than with all the libtard celebs #MAGA
Hail trump!
this guy is gonna stage a coup.
HE KNOWS DARN WELL,  that he doesn't prefer the "little people"  over the Dinner with biggies!
DUMPO  CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!
I love reading the misery of the limp-wristed left!
Omg! Look just at that crowd, looks like something out of the Goonies.
Having another tantrum in public..... The force of habit is hard to break, harder still when you're Dump Trump.
The thin skinned orangutan is scared of getting roasted.
Wheres Tyrion Lannister when you need him.
Love President Donald Trump! God Bless America!!!!!!!!
Yep, he's delusional and the power of retorate on the uneducated masses is absolutely astounding just like in play Julius Caesar but in real life. Only this time there is no Mark Anthony.
a much larger crowd eh? why not pan out and show us the size of your big manly crowd there big boy.
So many Liberals being salty again. WAAAAA WAAAA WAAAAAA thats all you cucks been doing since November WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA WAAAAAAAA WAAA WAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Trump is too dumb for that dinner anyway
That poor kid!
uncle Trump we love yo here in Africa 4 al😂😂😂😂
Lol you libtards just got so trolled. I'd hide under a rock after that. Go Trump!
How can you find that many dumbasses to make it to that rally?
Bullying disabled people, but can't take a joke from comedians. Weak conservatards.
Brilliant! :)
REAL AMERICANS DONT WORSHIP CELEBRITY.     Wake up.  please.  you will help everyone in doing so.  CNN slaves.
is this a Rick Sanchez impression?
She is so DENCE
Omg the editing in this video is hilarious. Great job!
She's not so bad, she's a fan of elvis the alien
What's the music at 2:14?

Ay caramba!
Why don't you just go to fucking pornhub or red tube if you want to fap.

why the fuck you in that females business she taking care of her life ....stop dissin people
Its rick from rick and morty therefor the drinking the burping the spit slurping.
Incredible content! Subbed!
Anyone know the song at 2:14? So good.
my wife literally thought you had a glass with opaque etched into it..  jesus whats wrong with my family.  Great video, awesome editing. as from i see is ALWAYS
Nerd City is awesome! keep it up!
Okay, I'm all for breastfeeding. I don't think it should be inherently sexual. But when you make it inherently sexual, it's sick.
I love your videos, they are so professional.I just subscribed yesterday. You are awesome!!!!
I AM MAD SCIENTIST ITS SO COOL  Your content is superb all around, you deserve more views.
You are the Rick Sanchez of YouTube.
Somebody really likes random color fillers.
only just found this channel. Fuck yes, it's awesome
So shes basically a nutcase with large tits.
In love with everything about this channel 💝 keep doing what you do
I always found sexualization of motherhood in general to be extremely fishy. This is the most egregious example, but not the only one by any means.
ey man is your voice like that fr?
I need to call my Mother and apologize for any negative thing I have ever said to her after watching this.
Nerd City. Well done mate, you make a change in character from the stereotyped crowd. Keep it up man!!
Wow I didn't know this was on you tube,
just found your channel and i fucking love it
fair enough if she wants to do porn, just keep your kid out of it- so vile
that editing tho.... like dude can i pay you to edit my sh-tty vids? have a little look at john kuckian and his charity fraud...and other shadiness, more lighthearted though
Breastfeeding is fine, in public or whatever. But shit, didn't realise someone would take it to this degree :/
These mommies seem to be ... milking it .. :D I love your content!
I feel so bad for her kids tbh.  Great video as always, though!
your just mad cuz she got more views then your sour ass.
I don't know how I got here, but subscribed!
I'm so glad that I found this channel! You deserve more subs dude, very entertaining!
love these videos . editing . humor. ur great man hopefully ubdont get fucked like h3h3 with the demonotization of yt vids
I love this channel
Great channel! Looking forward to more videos. Kinda want you to go down the Bashar rabbit hole now. Or Spirit Science (although that's too easy). Or Teal Swan.
You hit the nail on the head. Great job!
Hearing 'Welcome to the jungle' intro made me hit the subscribe button instantly and I did not regret that later. Really good content, man.
I hate vegans.  I hate the preachy, condescending kind of vegans, I mean.  ...Oh wait, never mind, that _is_ all vegans.  lol
How can giving birth be orgasmic while your insides are being expanded beyond their limits and your vagina is being torn off to the point where your vagina and your asshole become one entity?
Good editing, charming personality, how are you not a bigger channel?
She seems to get off on it, and if she's getting off on filming her kids sucking her breasts for other people to jerk off to, then that's super skeezy.
in your description boogie2988 is spelled wrong its missing an 8. XD
Need sauce for florida life sentence girl
I signed into my main gmail account just to sub. Impressive work, enjoyed every bit of music used and the editing. Will be coming back a lot here.
the sacconejolys!!!!! sick people
dr downvote is my new crush
High conscious baby formula? Is she making this out of shrooms?
You're pretty awesome, Dr. Downvote, can't wait to see your next videos. Definitely subbed.
Her lashes are fucked
I hope no one actually tries to give birth with dolphins. Dolphins are dicks and they're wild animals. It wouldn't surprise me if some lady and/or her baby gonna die unless they drug them dolphins to hell and back.
She says being Vegan is great but her babies aren't vegan if they're drinking her breast milk.
doctor who!!!!!!!!!!!
The voice, is BAD, otherwise I will watch, can you clear your throat?
why do you look like Chris Stuckmann's twin brother?
I had to comment again cause I just got to the south park part!!! 😂😂😂 did you make that all yourself!?!? so cool
I just subscribed and was reading comments and 3 days ago you had 5k subs and now you have 12k! I hope you get to a million someday cause you are AWESOME!!!! love the editing, man!
"empowerment"
I don't know what you and PewDiePie are watching to get those videos recommended. My side bar's all  DBZ, Star Wars, alternate history, and math.
I really like this channel. I hope it blows up
You are awesome at doing this.  Keep em cominh
oh man i hate you dont have more videos ! just want to binge watch
This Channel is my life now.
I actually like your voice. You remind me of Doug Stanhope.
Is there a track available somewhere for the music used at the end of your videos?
Just Finished watching the last four uploads....Keep going in this direction. You are clearly passionate and talented. Cheers
Doctor Downvote is easily my new favorite small YouTuber
am i the only one who had their recent video saying not available? :/
I knew this!!!! bc Nickelodeon did a shorts on kid inventors!!! 😂😂😂
this video tells lies, everyone knows herbert from family guy invented them in an attempt to get christopher in his basement! 😄 just being humorous, very informative video. 🎥
Why not illustrate the narration? It's hard to even focus on whats being said because I have to watch you make a paper popsicle
I'd say... How the ______ was invented.  TED decided to make videos.
Hey Ted, May I request you do a video on pedigree analysis video please? Thanks
I go to school with the inventors grandchildren,  but I'm skeptical of this story because it's never below freezing in this town
i was like what the spikes for.  so smart.
I thought the bay area never gets below freezing
Can you make a video about the Victorians because I am learning about them in school
and thank fuck for that accident what a good boy i love me a good popsicle
how did u bite the popsicle at the end????? and how come u don't have teeth marks
Ice, ice baby!
so you made a second popsicle just so its bitten?
I already knew this
Who took that bite?!
That was a pretty _cool_ vid!     I'm sorry plz don't hurt me
and, in a moment of vision, licks it
HE ATE THE PAPER xD
"In a moment of vision, licks it." Okay.
If my experience of leaving sugary drinks outside for any length of time is anything to go by, the original popsicle was probably 60% insect by the time it was licked.
Hey TED long time since a space vid. pls make one
Come on, lefties, don't be sad. we are unique
Heya there .. tone Does anyone  know larger  this versisn ?
I already knew the story but I just _had_ to watch for the animation!
You mean, in a moment of taste...
gonna buy some :))))))
so, being gay pays off too.
I rememeber watching the creation of the popsicle from the nick jr. show that showcase diff. inventions..don't remembsr the name.
1:14 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Seriously, was this video made by a bunch of virgins in a nunnery?
This is my favorite series
Shoulve patent it
Help me raise money to plant trees this summer around Michigan:) https://teespring.com/help-save-our-planet#pid=2&cid=2397&sid=front you get a t-shirt! thank you
0:54   Ha, got eee  that's what he said
soda-pop and icicle.
If you have found this comment: Do you think you would've been rave enough to lick the unfamiliar, frozen drink  that was outside last night?
yess these are my favorites!!
can you explain the HAARP ? it's really strange 🤔
We call em Icy Poles here in Australia
I always love these. Nice work as always!
I'm a simple man. I see "In a Moment of Vision," I click the like button.
These moments of vision vids r my least favorite ted-eds
Wait, did he bite on it? How?
Did the woman really eat the paper ?
I actually watched Ted Ed in school
You don't think people froze juice before that? I'm sure someone sold it before home too lol fuck frank.
i have an idea why do i like food
Who else thought it was just ice with flavoring? leave a like if so
so does the inventor get a royalty or anything for it or what?
i love this series
TH1S 1S 4N 4FFRONT TO TH3 BL1ND 1T DO3SNT T4K3 V1S1ON TO L1CK TH1NGS >:O –GC
Any artists here who noticed they used Copic markers? 🙋🏼
how many popsicle sticks are in a sheet of paper?
0:21 Reported for pornography.
Sadly, I already knew this. :P
My first thought was that she had to make two of those
wtf is a pepsicola
"...and in a moment of vision, he licks it" because... why the fuck not
Is it a contraction, or a portmanteau?
Nice, I will never use this information in my life !
In Ireland we call them ice pops.
Where do you guys get your music? I'm teaching a science topic for a project, but I can't find any fitting tunes.
Out of all the get rich quick inventions you can make if you end up back in time, this one is by far the easiest.
I remember it being on Nickelodeon or some other kids' channel.
I'm surprised that something that seems so simple has a recognised inventor - I would have imagined it would be known (but not necessarily popular) in almost any culture that has access to freezing.
I don't like this type of fast forward animation. I'm more entertained about the process of making the cardboard popsicle  than the actual information of the video
another treat made by accident
Sweet! Brb buying some popsicles.
Well, yes this is cool but  I couldn't get a word while watching how you do  the popsicle with paper.
what about soda-pop and icicle
0.54 it looks like a dick
How about the boy called it popsicle because it was made out of pop(soda) and was frozen like an icicle?
got me cold shivers at the last frame
Really digging this series!
0:24 I'm to pedo for education
made for time pass only ......sub standard
I just Love it that you make the thing you are Talking about out of paper, it makes it easyer to watch the video i think
Can anyone become my friend on any social networking site ... I am 13 years old
"in a moment of vision, licks it"
Lol Nickelodeon made cartoon about it like 20 years ago.
"...and in a moment of vision, licks it"
In a moment of Vision, He licks it, Lmaoo.
I guess you could say his name _popped_ up in history...
Popsicles were invented in the Bay Area?! YEE it's lit. Rest in peace Mac Dre! Where we dance a little different. Thank you Frank Dre.
Each year, approximately 100 million trees are cut to provide the wood for popsicle sticks worldwide.
btw i am eating a popsicle 😂😂
I heard popsicles were invented when Herbert from Family Guy was researching a way to get neighborhood kids into his basement...
Who else watched it two times - one for the story and one for the craft.
Some of the best inventions were accidental.
This information TOTALLY isn't useless and I can TOTALLY use this for a big purpose        But seriously though, it's fun knowing origins XD
Perfect video for this time of the year. It's getting so very hot! I think I'll make a popsicle lol
are you just FRIEKIN KIDDING ME SOMEONE TOOK UR INTRO N REPLACED HIS YOUR YOUTUBE NAME WITH HIS YOUTUBE NAME  #NOPE

Volcanoes doNOT exist in Earth and neither warm waters or thermal waters.
Lesson of the day, don't go to an "unauthorized area". It's unauthorized for a reason. Jeesh.

Some of these ppl should have died. We don,t need anymore stupid in this world
I'm going on vacation in three days...thanks.
that last one is just gross
some call it crazy, I prefer 'Amusing' and/or 'Darwin Award' material...Or just plain shitty,hilariously long odds catching up to a person.
Half of these can be avoided by following one rule "Don't go swimming in strange places" Advice from Florida... DO NOT swim in anything other than a pool.

Top 10? Sick fucks
Why people choose to go to Thailand now I will never understand. It's the most dangerous place to visit.
The first video in the intro not the ocean one but  the one after it. It has a ghost baby face
so you rank the way a person died and made money out of it you sick bastards
Wow, you have a list of your favourite tourist deaths, that's a little disturbing.
It's always cool when you take a guess at what #1 will be and you're right.
lol death by selfie
Pfft, selfie death.... your social life ends there.
Most of these are just idiots that God got tired of letting live.
Even coconuts kill you in Australia

Well, technically the Yellowstone guy fell into a volcano as well, just not in the same sense since he was already inside the crater.
Number one: Kids, that's why you don't go places people tell you not to go to. YOU DIE A HORRID DEATH.
Number 10 is Scary
Patrick: "DAH HA HA HA HA HA! THAT GUY GOT HIT WITH A COCONUT!"

I'm surprised Sacred Falls in Hawaii wasn't on this list.

When tourists do things they're not supposed to do you can't help but be like.... this could have all been avoided if you just....
I always hated that arrow trend just to show how stupid I am  NO OF COURSE I DIDN'T SEE THAT VOLCANO  MAN  HOW STUPID AM I  IM GLAD YOU MADE ME NOTICE THAT  THANKS!

Coconuts are evil 😨
#8 well at least its not a durian
Thanks for the arrow on the thumbnail, didnt know what i was looking at
I died on Vacation once
And this is why I stay home.
stop using the damn arrows!
The way the title is written, you think that this'll have a comedic atmosphere, such as Matthew Santoro, or one of the many other videos similar to his
0:16 hmmmmm wonder if the TITANIC counts
Such fragile creatures Humans are, they tend end up in another dimension by some very unfortunate circumstances. If not by accident, then by each-other.
That's why you don't do stupid things aka number 10
When I die, i hope to end up in one of WM's shitty videos too!

"The BBC would like to appologize..."
S A V A G E A F
Liberals can literally get away with murder.
Holy fuck that dude just "Chris Browned" Chris Brown...
Team rhi all the way
"TV's Andy Levy" - in other words, here's a buddy of mine with no talent or credits and his name is Andy Levy.
So... does this make Chris Brown president for 2020?
hahaha this man is killing it
fuck you Chris brown u ass sucking faggot
Like A Boss
Thanks for the laughtrack telling me when it's ok to laugh.
Absolutely barbaric
Chris Browns favorite drink is Hawaiian punch
What he SHOULD have apologized for was calling Chris Brown a R&B "singer".
well fucking said.
must be Canadian
RIP in pieces Chris Brown, beater of women, you will not be missed.
why is this the news?
I really like his dead-pan delivery.
chris brown is scum
Fuck Chris Brown.
Damn, Hawkeye has no chill.
that last one liner is fucking gold
BOOM. Fuck Chris Brown
Would probably be a lot better without the laugh track.
POKER FACE  GAME ON POINT.
Savaaage! Noice! This was perfect. I love it.
.........wow. Never thought I would see anything on Fox News I want to applaud....
Normally I don't support Faux News. Well played on this. Chris Brown is a cowardly POS.
women beating men is comedy, or is applauded.
I KNOW I can hear Jim Norton's laugh!
I saw this a many years ago. But I'm glad to see this trend on Reddit.
God, the way he can keep a straight face. I'd be dying trying to get all of that out.
the fact hes obviously reading a scripted response on a teleprompter ruins this for me.
hhhhhhhhhhhhh
This guy is a fucking savage and I love it.
Hey not bad for a fox corespondent, I suppose a broken clock can be right at least twice a day.  Sorry.
chris brown is such douche bag
holy shit this is the best apology ever
Damn, savage.
daaaamn, Chris brown just got Rekt!
BOOM HEAD SHOT
Okay. That Reporter is an ACE in my book! There will always be a place for him at my thanksgiving-dinner table. Dude's awesome.
you cant watch this its on fox news
Stop talking about how reddit or anyone else brought you here, you fucking millennial retards!
unkind guys
to be fair, rihanna is probably a psychologically horrifying bitch that can send any man over the edge.
it makes it so much better that he didn't laugh or smile
you sir are awesome
I found the next American president!
ok...i hate fox news...but ...this was awesome
say what you want about Fox News but Red Eye is funny as fuck
my reddit leads me here.
That guy on the left is a big phaggot
FUCK YALL HATERS OHB ALL DAY
1k butthurt fanboys. lol
does anyone know what CB's reaction to this was?
dude needed to drop the mike on that serrve!
This is similar to when Stephen A Smif berated the redskins and called them losers
Savage as fuck

I dunno, I don't think he really meant it.

people only think fox news is so biased because that's what the rest of the news media tells them. of course it is slightly leaning right but it's nothing compared to how left the rest of media is.
Were can i buy this boat?
IT is for sure €10.000 because how badass It looks
'portability and storage have never been so simple' Even though it is relatively small for a boat, it still looks like you are wearing a fucking spaceshuttle on your shoulders.

"I don't stand by anything!" - Donald Trump, President of the USA, 2017  A quote for the history books that speaks for itself.
Disrespect, understandable but sad.
GORGE Washington. LOL perfect.
I don´t know what everyone is talking about.  It´s pretty to the point.  I think it´s right on.
Homophobic and fat shaming wow Stephen new low.
Thank you Colbert for saying what we were all thinking. This is awesome
I could feel the awkwardness radiating from that interview
I don't see a problem here
Colbert for president!
You know what ruins all of these Colbert monologues is that fucking campy Jon - cut his mic!!!
well done mr stephen colbert, well done
Who's that heckler who keeps being heard in the background all the time?
The magic starts at 11:10 -- enjoy! Someone make a song about this please...
The difference between a Clown and the Joke of the US Government *Mr Hump* is a clown wears makeup!
Love. it well said stephen..
FREE SPEECH.  SUCK IT UP SNOWFLAKES
Colbert just tore him a new one...lmfao
great job mr.colbert
I saw tweets calling the dick holster joke "hate speech". How the fuck is this hate speech, it's just funny.
shit that WAS savage. Daaaamn.
All this toilet paper that muslims could have used instead of using their bear fingers.
WOW! I didn't think I could love Stephen Colbert more!
You got a fan for life Colbert!!! Thank you.  I think we should all send the Pres a used dousche bag with a note attached just Thinking of You.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!! :) :p Thanks a Lot, Trump!!! :)
Disgusting and vile. Fire him today. He does not belong on tv. Put him in a little club full of drunks who would tolerate a depraved rant from a small minded failure of an "entertainer"
that cock in mouth part is totally over the line, otherwise a great devastating segment
Absolutely right on the money, Mr. Colbert!  😂
Colbert was awesome!!!  Love him/  What a great take down of that orange thin skinned juvenile son of a bitch.  45 is a classic douche bag.
Everyone knows Trump has sucked Putin's cock and swallowed every time.
Hey trump supporter tell me again how the left are the only "snowflakes"?
People like this is why trump won
Fuck yeah I love you Stephen
lost it at "* * * * holster" XD
BAM! FINE FORM STEPHEN! KEEP GOING STRONG!!!
My Tax return is this high, my Tax return is huuuuuuge
How 'bout that cash me ousside: some sniper will. (by no means do I  advocate violence)
Colbert is my new hero
So sad that Cobert still feels this way almost 6 months after the election.  I've seen 3 year olds being more mature.  Get over it.
So, when we take into account where Stephen's hands are most of the time during his monologues, there is no doubt, that everything is in his pants...
God damn !! How didn't Trumptard resign after this burn ?
feels good to ease the pain ....!!!   Let in burn !! I love this !! Keep it going guys ! 😊
Liberals are such hypocrites
stephen is the best by far
fake people are sheeple for sure. please examine and research EVERYTHING!  You will be AMAZED!
*Michelle Obama is a man*
Mr. Colbert, God bless you and all who sail on you! I'm not Dickerson either!
Its super fun to insult someone by calling them gay.
I missed the apparently 'homophobic' slur at the end I don't understand what people are so upset about
holy bazinga!!!!!! =D
HE WANTS THE BEST FOR  AMERICA AND IDIOTS CRITICIZE HIM, LIBTARDS SO STUPID
It's not homophobic at all. Although it is definitely going a little bit too far with attacking Trump.
Wow Stephen has finally said something terrible about Trump, just like he has always done in the past
This is why I love this man! Wait, LGBTQ folks, what exactly did you find offensive to your group from this? Genuinely baffled:/
Stephen Colbert just made his show a must watch.
LOL Colbert has no material whatsoever he constantly needs to make fun of a human being for attention
Colbert makes playground jokes while Trump repeals Obamacare. I know what I'm laughing at.
It's funny how the week minded love this guy, they think he's a journalist...sad but true.
Subscribed :)
hahaha. the man has balls the size of 90000000000 tax returns.
That was perfect
I'm gay and I wasn't fucking offended at all. I was only offended by Stephen's tie.
Aqua Man, personal friend, great guy.
I laughed at 10:43 when he added "to his face" LMFAO, so he has the dignity to insult him behind his back, but not to his face? That's pretty sad.
Perfect!   Trump needs to hear what we are all thinking! Trump is a piece of garbage
Cock holster? That's it? I mean I guess it's homophobic but he doesn't deserve to lose his job. Seems like a bit much.
Hehehe trump is a cunt. He fooled good people into voting for him. Not like Hillary wasn't a cunt too. Shit what a choice.
The best monologue!!! You go Stephen!
You can tell Stephen's been waiting to say that for a long time holy shit
Sooo... I'm confused. Which part of this is homophobic?
Thank you sooo much Stephen for putting Orange Orangutango right to his place where he needs to be and this is in putins dick
Blessings and Peace be unto Colbert
Colbert is a true American hero!
Support you Mr. Colbert!! Damm those stupid whiners that cant take a joke on Twitter
Loved it thank you
#Colbert4President
Looks stupid. No thanks I'll wait for it to bomb and come out on TV in one week. Leave it to White washed hollyweird.
How to Be a Latin Lover FULLMOVIE https://plus.google.com/+McQuinGanesStaringDika/posts/EtyZwvJXcXY
Kept waiting for a crazy ex-wife to pop out screaming at him "ANIMAL!!!"
What is the name of the first song?
People mad about the dick scene but Americans had no problem when a 12 year old Brooke Shield had sex scenes and was nude witha grown man.
The Movie was okay. I believe this story line was similar to his last movie.
it wasn't bad but it wasn't that funny either... Eugenio pls stop doing this Adamn-Ssandlerish movies I know you can do better. Come back to Mexico and make a tv show or something.
This movie was so amazing it was really funny
IMA watch this movie today
Y'all are complaint about 1:00 yet I saw kids going into sausage party and there was like a 5 min orgy scene🤦🏻‍♀️

Latins eh it could be worse, at least it's not french.
I'm more than happy to teach you guys
CALM DOWN sensitive people! Eugenio "said" he had a hand towel inside his pants so the boy was not really touching his package
Don't blame SJWs for getting angry at the dick scene. SJWs like that kind of degenerate shit.

Is gonna be really funny movie but doesnt make sense the part were he get dumped, wouldn't he he get half of all the money. i gues people dont pay attention to does parts.
he's a master piece, too many characters since 90's
i bet you Adam Sandler gonna wacth this, Eugenio is a genie in a bottle
I'm calling it, I think this will be a razzie contender for worst movie of the year!
oh wow. i never heard him speak english before.
Latin lover, I didn't know Latin people still existed?

1:52 okay I actually laughed with that one
*I really want to see this movie,I can't wait :)
I get its a movie and a comedy but really? Yes please, teach your 10 year old nephew to pick up chicks, (/s) that's not inappropriate at all.
13:22 *How to Be a Latin* #fuIImovie ( PLUS.GOOGLE.COM/u/0/+QuickflixMovie/posts/9BTKjk3ZWe2 )
im a hispanic myself, and i find this hilarious
The only part of this I find offensive is that Eugenio Derbez seems set on becoming the Mexican Adam Sandler. Smh
I'm Hispanic and this doesn't offend me at all. Just found the kid touching a grown man's crotch to be fucking weird.  Other than that the movie looks fine.
after watching intrusion not included i wanted to see more of this guy
boooo this sucks!! Dervez you should do something like your last movie this is just like Adam Sandler, he. is one of the most hated actors
im mexican and im dying rn 😂😂
this guy looks like me jaja for real...
that pool scene had my bowling. till i realized we've probably seen all the funniest parts of the movie in the trailer
I'm Latina and this looks pretty good.
If this was an Asian movie they would call it "How to teach Asian to be a Lover"
Sure let's teach 10 year old boys to UNDRESS women with their eyesthis is the problem right here with america!!!!!

LMAO >.< Im Latin and don't find this offensive- its all good, we don't care. This movie looks promising, those are good actors.
cant wait for it, it seems funny as hell
Wtf is this bullshit?!
nice uniform there hay 😙
How funny is that!  Raquel Welch, Hubba, Hubba :-)
This looks like Adam Sandler's movies... but this is even worse
Looks pretty funny ima check it out
This movie triggers me, but not because of the whole "Latin lover" thing.  It triggers me because it looks fucking awful
These comments are actually making me wonder if people even *know* what a pedophile is.
People in the comments act like the kid actually took his fucking dick out and started fondling it. Calm the fuck down.
I'm half mexican and half hispanic and my family finds this HILARIOUS   he'll also be in the rebooted film "Overboard" so you guys need to calm down.
The kid accidentally blocks the guy, which just happens to be at crotch level, and the retard SJW's go mad.
this ad appears every video I see and it kind of scares me please help
A child grabbing a man's dick is comedy. Wow.
If Billy Bob Thornton was Spanish
Lol the age differences of these characters
This looks hilarious lol
And I thought Don't Mess With the Zohan was bizarre.
Y'all getting triggered in the comments THIS IS MADE BY A SPANISH FILM COM
I'M MEXICAN AND MY FAMILY THINKS THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE GREAT JESUS  PEOPLE XDXDXD
you guys are way to sensitive fucking chill man my fellow mexicans think this is very funny movie looks grreat
Im looking forward to this movie
Not sure whether to find it funny or disturbing when the kid grabs his dick. ... okay that came out wrong.
The shoe polish scene 😂  Why didn't they just use Cake By the Ocean instead of that knock off?
If I want to buy an 'American' car do I buy a Ford made in Mexico or a Kia made in Georgia?
OMG! I NEED TO SEE THIS!!
What's the Cake By The Ocean knockoff playing in the beginning called?
Guys, it's a movie...stop being so fucking sensitive when there's no need to be sensitive. Relax, and laugh at things that are funny rather than trying to find something to get your panties in a bunch over.
At first, i thought this was another Mr. Clean commercial.
The kid actor probably didn't actually touch his dick, he was probably wearing a jock or something (I think that's what there called.)
looks like shit
As a young man, it would be good to have had an influence like this guy growing up
fucking funny
0:59 what the fuck 😠
1:00 Really? That's just too much.

I've got this car on Forza Horizon 2 and I truly fell in love with the SLR.
i just realized that back then it mclaren vs Porsche vs ferrari
always did like the slr. looks  like a muscle car.
Really? It can do that?
Giant reverse opening hood: Check Monster engine: Check Obnoxious exhaust: Check Tiny cockpit: Check Shitty radio: Check Ridiculous power: Check Hot exhaust warning stickers: Check  So.... Germany's Viper.  Love it
Says slr is completely different from Enzo, but compares it to Enzo
nice videos man.. especialy when u show all that crazy buttons nad hidden spaces... so nice
my main man Doug you need a better mic
My old Saab's hood opened like that. Interior is horribly bland 90's though.
Hey Doug, do you have a page on Autotrader?????
SLR 722s i would pick over any car
The hood opening  reminds me of a classic Saab 900.
Dude, you forgot to mention the price of DA HOOD.
rather have a AMG GT S or SLS
Now to open the hood, you must first start the process by lifting this red lever under the steering column on Autotrader/oversteer
Please park it in my yard and forget about it
overpriced cars are easily forgettable
Come and take a look at our spotting chain in Lyon, we put our first video! Thanks my friend!
It was the worlds fastest automatic car and one of my favourite cars on GT5.
Over half million views in two days, good going.
Now speaking of things opening ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Doug, you need a XKRS review on your channel. Soon. Convertible.
Man fuck yo column shove up your ass I'm here to see not read
Few similar features as my cls amg ;)
Honestly it looks like shit and there are tons of better cars for cheaper.
I didn't forget about this car. It's one of my favorites.
Looks like it had a Viper chassis
Doug DeBest
That AC control knob is the best thing I've ever seen for controlling AC.
What a shit car
also the trick hood was on my 1987 buick park avenue
not sure if its a negative that a torque converter automatic can get you from 0 to 60mph in 3.5 sec.
Could u please do the weinermobile next
Okay so this is Jay Leno's SLR and this guy is Jay Leno's son because they have the same weird ass mouths and the same blabedy bla talk.
Wow.. yeah. I havent seen or thought about this car since like.. Project Gotham Racing 2 or something around that time.. An early Forza maybe? fuck this car is goddamn wicked.
Ahhh i remember this from BL #2 Bull. Messing up my M3 GTR in NFSMW
this was THE CAR among my friends in fifth grade. now that I know what went into and how it stacks up against other cars... I still really like it
from 3-4k $ ?! where did You found  that kind of offers
Ffs the carrera gt isnt the last analogue supercar lol
I've always loved the SLR. I first fell in love with it when I would play Gran Turismo 4 and use the SLR in a lot of my races. I'm more of a JDM fan now, but I still love the SLR and a few more supercars.
Do the mclaren F1 one day :)
I remember reading about this when I was 7 or 8 in my "supercars" book
"...now when you're going 60 miles an hour on the highway, the air break automatically pops up 10 degrees, just so that its ready, incase you wanna brake really FAST"..
I would have compared the SLR to a Corvette and not a Mustang. LOL
this is what I would own. It is forgotten but it is still one of the best supercars ever. I would really love to have that design
@7:33 "Approximately room enough for one total ash." Hahahha
As great as these videos are, I was digging around in the older stuff and remembered how much I loved the Which Car Should You Buy videos
Yea cause it's huge and ugly
dude its a super(muscle)car
I live in an ordinary neighbourhood and there is one of them down the road from me. Also a Lamborghini gallardo superleggera, and a lotus
Shit car,shit review.
it kinda reminds me of the tvr in the way it  is so quirky
I have a new dream car.
It's shaped like a foot
"Well speaking of things opening" yo mamas legs
why dont u ever show the motors on the cars u review?
A 1990 Buick Park Ave Electra hood lifts the same way
So much like a batman cat.
Price will go up now that you made this video...
I'm almost positive he got one thing wrong. The air brake raises 10 degrees at/above 60mph to assist aerodynamics (like the porsche GT2). Not "just so it's ready, in case you wanna brake really fast".
ugly as shit... looks like a 1996 lexus sc400... 500k? fuck outta here.
You're the man, Doug!
breaks the hood latch of the SLR
I wouldn't pay no  more that 75,000 if I had it
jay didn't let you drive his SLR!?
nice review
It's quite obvious but this dude is white as f**k sounds like he on a sitcom.
Forgotten my ass! I'd suck a tranny off for one of these.
Does the Ghibli?
Doug's clothes are less horrible in this video.
Are you related to Jay Leno?
Doug DeMuro: The most basic of basic bros
I think the proper term for this car is "Haul Ass"
Ugly ass fucking car! Anyone who buys this shit ought to be shot!
Wow, that's the least I've ever seen a German car depreciate
Doug said quirks AND mentioned his Autotrader column in the first two minutes. Gonna be a good video
you're not a true car person if you don't know the SLR popular cars ain't the only ones that exist
most asthetically pleasing car ever made
My front area is very long too.
Price doesn't move because they are pieces of shit.
What model year is it
Any car that goes over 200mph is going to have a "little rumble."
All the 12 year olds watching: "No I couldn't forget these! My dad had one and I have 2 sitting next to my Veyron and new Chiron
Has anyone ever checked whether the  autotradr/Oversteer section even exists?
I can tell you that this car is hard to control!
I've been in love with this car ever since I saw paris hilton in hers

18:44 OMFG I hate you, I opened so many loot  boxes, but had to buy that Genji skin, had two legendary once and one was a duplicate and the other wasn't even for the fucking event lol.
You'd think after a full year of this game, people would have learned that meta doesn't matter.
5 shots 1 2 3 4 FUCK!
Now all we need is a junkrat vid.
I feel the same Brad people hate my bastion and honestly hate me for always getting play
i have a video exactly like this. my friends bully me for playing reaper then i get a six man
Wanna play more Reaper? Learn to reload cancel

Well i still don't know.. What's happening in the brad's thought😂
I'm a reaper main over 100 hours on him
Woah u do sound like illusive
9:32 Here comes the ( YOU WUT M8! ) face. XD
9:17 CC on "you know rape is amazing"
When anyone gives you grief for playing reaper saying he doesn't work for bla bla bla... just send them a link to this video. :P
Toxicity is trul detroying this game.
Zyl, times have been hard with me, i have a virus witch is not letting me breathe well, and school has been hard, and i wanted to say thank you for the awesome work and giving me a laugh every single day :)
I main reaper and it's fun to see potg by me daily. I have no life. Send help

2 event gold skins in one loots box never has my eye twitched so much
Fishy only salty because the ocean has salt water not his fault
I like how he got the 2 legendary skins that I wanted in one lootbox
Reaper is my main and i average  35 kills
No a black screen it's to edgy

Oowww, I think the edgy-ness cut me. Quick get a band aids!
