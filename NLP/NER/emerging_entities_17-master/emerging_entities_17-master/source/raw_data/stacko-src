As you mention, it the fact that the first polariser 'converts' unpolarised light to polarised light that does the majority of the perceived attenuation. For an interesting test (for the OP who has the sheets..), take the first two sheets and arrange them as a crossed polariser at maximum extinction, then insert a third polariser between them at a 45 degree angle. What happens and Why... ?
@notstoreboughtdirt - Probably not.  "[C]onduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator" doesn't cover anything related to the job they will be taking or specific facts or commentary on the nominee's qualifications.  It only restricts discussing *things that were done* (conduct) or the *reasons for them* (motive).  So "You have no experience with _______" is valid, but "You took bribes from the _____ industry" is not.

Thanks Jack, your line **But I wonder based on what we can define this formula?

But I will need to check. Thanks

senate democrats eliminated the nuclear option when they had the majority a few years ago, over republican objections. the republicans warned that without the nuclear option, the democrats could lose a powerful means to stop the republican administration nominees if / when the table is turned. well, the democrats today would have loved to undo what they enthusiastically did a few year back.

I think the question is a bit restrictive, as it implies the *contents* of the emails are the only factor that may be significant, and precludes, for example, consideration of how having the emails drip-feed to the press meant drowned out other stories that may have been good for clinton or bad for trump. Suggest rewording it as "how could the release of the hacked clinton/DNC emails have influenced the election outcome?"

In my judgment, the goal is to determine the torque about the COM.  This can then be set equal to the angular acceleration times the moment of inertial about the COM.  We can get this torque about the COM using any other point as the axis of rotation by including the pseudo force through the COM and the moment it produces.

I'm not sure your answer is correct. Even if we know the EXACT wave function, the outcome of an experiment can be subject to probability. For instance, we know the exact wave form of the electron in an hydrogen atom. However, when we try to measure the position of the electron, what we get is a probability distribution around the nucleus. This is what we call an "orbital".

However, there is another reason to avoid cities or even villages: Most people don't like witchers and highly distrust them (yeah, they might be useful to get rid of mosters, but they are somehow monsters themselves and may rob your children if you're not careful). So it is safer for witchers to stay among themselves, far away from other people.

@knzhou lets take light of 500nm. In the single slit (width = 0.1mm), we find the first maximum at an angle of 0.286 degrees. Now lets take a diffraction grating of the same width with 1000000 slits carved into it. The equation: dsin(x)= (lambda).   d=10^-10. Now the first maximum does not even appear on the screen. These are 2 very different results. Did i miss something?
How much information is stored in a genome and how much in the distribution of genomes in a species?
I disagree with MAC address filtering and SSID broadcast. Turning off SSID broadcast means that the SSID will be broadcast during communications. You only turn of the periodic beacon and thus you **lower** your security since rogue AP are now easier. As for MAC-address filtering: Active MACs are also broadcast. No added security. Lastly, chaing the name is a good idea, but if I see a WAP with the ID 'Belkin' and a wireless radio with a MAC from Cisco then I also can figure that out.

The blue shifting could even get to the point that the microwave background is visible, I really don't know. I think as far as the more extremely warped paths of light coming up from near the black hole, you might look at the black hole from interstellar. They modeled all of the light really well. However, I think you have some creative leeway here given just how complex the paths of rays near a black hole can be. Best of luck

It actually is much more complicated than "10."  You could technically turn your fingers upside down and now have a completely new biometrics scan.  Finger on side?  45*?  As you mentioned there is user error, but with Computer Vision you can know how off it is, and if it's above a certain degree, i.e., 15*, then it's not the "same print," if that make sense.  There are also toes if you want to do that, and I have heard people using all sorts of weird body parts for scans.

And 2) I'd overwrite the stick or sd card after use, not terminate processes or reboot.

@jmac That is a very good point well made. Far too often people perceive executives as good for nothing morons that don't understand anything. As a general rule anyone who has made it to the position of an executive must have some experience and results to show. While how much money a person makes is not a perfect measure of general competence it's a fairly decent indicator.At the very least they must have been competent at getting the job of an executive which is more then most of us can say.

Yes, that's a cultural problem. Tools of the State can't be expected to teach dissenting viewpoints, so I don't think they accumulate blame.

Outside for two minutes, he would see a drift of 2362 metres, well enough to take him away from the ship.

Just put the sum mass in $kg$ in the formula for $m_i$ and $m_i$ is in $kg$. The real diameter is set by the physical situation you are considering, e.g. the diameter of some galaxy.

But then again, this could cause vendors to purposefully skew the CVE data and report their own CVEs only when a solution has been found so that the CVE can be closed soon after.

(tagging @user21820 as well) All devices eventually succumb to entropy.  An electric motor with its magnetic fields may collapse very quickly.  The chemically bonded structure of the rock will collapse very slowly (potentially outlasting the door, depending on materials).  However, for when a normal 16 year old OP asks a question like this, they probably assume the rock lasts "forever," which is a very reasonable approximation for most situations short of geologic timescales.

I agree with you for free electrons. For atoms I'm inclined more to the observed charge neutrality due to canceling out the protons and electrons fields.

You cannot use other covariant things for constant tensor $C^{\mu\nu}$  for example Kronecker delta has different indices structure i.e. $\delta^\mu{}_\nu$ so you need to write $C^{\mu\nu}=B \eta^{\mu\nu}$ when $B$ is a constant scalar.
I think we talk about matter distribution when we talk about the size of the universe and energy apart from space-time energy. We know about the expansion of that matter and energy, but the space probably has existed outside of our "universe". It's just that space is being created between the matter that is increasing the size of the universe.

Don't imagine the cosine as the function you use to solve a right triangle in contexts like this one. When you're finding the horizontal component of the vector, you're finding the dot product of your vector and $\hat{\textbf{i}}$, which is given by $\vec{\textbf{A}} \textit{\hat{i}}} = \abs{\vec{\textbf{A}}\cos{\theta}$.

Well assuming it's correct here's a hint maybe. You can consider $\Sigma$ to be $\delta(x')\delta(y')$ and plug in the potential of a point charge into your formula to derive an integral expression for the delta function. Then you can write an arbitrary potential as an integral over point sources, and you'll see your formula is valid as long as it is valid for the delta function. But I was skeptical the formula is valid for the delta function since the integrand seems to be strictly positive.

It doesn't mater that after the cups are full they are going to recycle the water back into the pitcher, because they can't fill the cups in the first place.

In this sense, the Coulomb repulsion is hidden by some sort of "change of variables".

It is just a cautionary argument informing the OP that one cannot cathegorically affirm that ‚Äúatoms individually have no color‚Äù. Since, if one considers that for a thing to have color, it just need to send light (photons) into our eyes (by a process of some sort), then atoms individually can do that, even if such a color is not necessarily one found in a rainbow

If something happens to have a disparate impact on specific race, say that, instead of implying that it was designed so it would have disparate impact.

A WAF is usually the wrong level to try prevent web shell infection - if you can upload executable files to a server, there will be ways to bypass a WAF through encoding, or splitting data, or using a multi stage payload. It might be difficult, but there are lots of ways to hide data. You're better off preventing the upload of executable files on the server - put uploads in a folder which doesn't allow execution, rename them, etc.
Using full disk encryption would work - doesn't prevent ransomware (but that's not a concern in the original question), but even if the hard drive is removed, an attacker wouldn't be able to access the data. A container is less good, since it's possible traces of the files could be written in clear form to the drive, whilst they're being used - that applies to both encrypted zip and veracrypt container.

HSTS or any http-to-https redirect is a **bad** practice for an API: if the developer mistakenly use http instead of https, an automatic redirect will hide that error, and the API credentials will leak! If the http version of the API systematically answer an error, that kind of mistake can be avoided.

Thanks for your answer, I'll update the question and be more specific. For now, $z$ and $x$ are indeed accelerations. A wheel with imbalance is a wheel that's not spinning around it's center of mass. The phase and magnitude of the imbalance are the location of the mass and it's weight causing the wheel to be out of balance. This can be seen from a stationairy wheel, where the accelerometer is at a certain point (let's say o degrees from the x-as).

One item that is missing from this answer - almost all crimes are prosecuted at the state level, including murder.  Sometimes there are crimes that fall into federal jurisdiction, or both.  Presidential pardon power pertains to forgiving crimes as recognized under federal statute, so promising to pardon someone for murdering a litterbug would not stop state and local criminal justice processes from moving forward and punishing an offender.
To start thinking about this you need to think about why there is resistance in the first place.   What prevents a charge carrier to accelerate without bound when subject to an electric field.

Maybe you could use TLS-SRP?

Statistical mechanics aims at doing much more than merely deriving the equations of states of thermodynamic systems. Indeed, it allows you to address a multitude of questions that cannot be addressed with thermodynamics. Moreover, ergodicity (in its usual form) is irrelevant to statistical mechanics (this is discussed in many places on this site).
P.S thats interesting yours does it too. I'm sure I've successfully ARP spoofed over wireless in the fairly distant past (2008/2009). The last few times I tried the devices didn't let me (2011-12), and I never tried again or thought any more of it until I saw this question.

Among the many advantages of film, the fact that you can keep the negatives in a metal box for 100 years and it will be preserved without any damage or associated cost is a tremendous advantage. A lot of digital data produced in the world will most likely disappear within the next 50 years by lack of time-resisting support or backup budget or skilled technicians.
I would challenge this definition of democracy. A true democracy is majority rule only, (c) and (d) are not part of the definition. The United States, of course, is a republic, not a democracy.

In part, shooting darker is itself probably a pushback against the even, flat lighting that's also common, esp. on tv. So it's pushback on pushback on pushback as with so many things. But another trend is also more frenetic action scenes with freely moving cameras (the _Bourne_ movies did this, Michael Bay made it worse); that probably also carries some of the blame for actions scenes being harder to follow, not just the lighting.

Sauron still had considerable forces in Barad-Dur, the Last Alliance were harried all the way to Barad-Dur & i'm pretty sure the orcs sortied a lot & rained arrows and stones down on the besiegers, Anarion being killed in the 6th year by a stone from the tower. Also I think Sauron, in his arrogance, never thought that anyone would want to destroy the ring, he thought all would be twisted and wish to dominate as he did.

The "mass viewers" means some sort of organized thing - e.g. a poll/survey indicating general opposition to the approach, or petition, or just clearly-demonstrable public complaints that can be measured e.g. on rotten tomatoes

The following relevant paper was just published in ApJ at:  [https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aa5da6](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aa5da6).  It discusses damage to a spacecraft hull from the interstellar gas and dust in detail.
If you want to say that one parameter is much smaller than the other, you'd write $x\ll y$.
I find the requirement to be a control of political speeches - how people organize for political purposes is a form of political speeches. Why should we prohibited non-democratic forms of political organization when we insist that government shouldn't be in thee business of controlling how people voice their views?

And of course Susskind (Stanford) on YouTube and James Binney of Oxford also on YouTube.  Best of luck with it, I self study myself, the big drawback is you have to force yourself to do the exercises, which are vital, even with no exams.
In Star Trek, why do Federation / Starfleet ships always seem to delay returning fire until it's almost too late?
The resistance is four times **lower** so the current increases by four times but the current density (current/area) stays the same.
Ahhh...so, that explains Harry Doyle saying that he makes the catch "Willy Mays style"  I know absolutely nothing about baseball, but I love this movie :)

Just from reading the synopsis at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_by_the_Sea_(film)), it would seem it was his way of not 'making himself comfortable' at a place he had no intention of staying in, once his obligations to his deceased brother were taken care of.

There's a missing factor of $i$ in the kinetic term and a missing factor of $-1$ in the mass term. Also, Schwarzschild implies a singularity at the center, whilst you are searching for a non-singular solutions, right?

@DavidGrinberg The 3/5 compromise had nothing to do with the status of the slaves. It only had to do with the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives. The North (free states) wanted slaves to not count because they were not considered citizens in the slave states and the South (slave holding states) wanted them to count fully (to increase thir political power).
Thank you. I'm so glad the internet was 'invited'(LOL)!

Teddy Roosevelt had a somewhat weird situation as well.  The Republicans probably *should* have primaried Taft in favor of him, but they didn't and it (may have) cost them the WH.
@CraigHicks I think people usually talk about the centroid of voters, not the minimized sum of distances (geometric median), since a single voter moving around can move the median around a lot
In Pushing Daisies Digby has lived much longer than a normal dog since he's been "alive again"; is he immortal? Therefore is Chuck immortal?
Nothing is free. The US didn't do this out of the goodness of their heart. Their military protection let them get away with many things that might otherwise not have been supported by other countries. Spending this much on military power was always a business decision in the end.
I don't think its possible to give you a quantitative measure of how much forward security multiple hash functions would buy. Basically, using multiple hash functions guards against a weakness in any one of them, so as long as just one survives through the decades, you're safe. But you can't put that into probabilities without making assumptions about the future.
That is part of my question - will it? OR rather - can we say 100% it definitely never will

@Bob Bee, thank you for the response, I've accepted it, I hope someone will come up with the right process, I read about the quantum gravity in wikipedia before and I thought that the exact interaction between matter-energy and spacetime is already known before trying to unify them, but now I think that all those theories avoid the problem and trying hard to unify an effect (gravity) to the other forces.
I'm not sure why this is getting downvotes. Some constructive criticism please?
The title is about liberals and conservatives, while the question text is about Republicans and Democrats. That's a bit confusing. There are liberals and conservatives in both parties.

IIRC, the movie director submits a list of award categories he thinks his film should be considered for to the academy.  The academy then decides which of those categories the film should be properly nominated for (No, they don't watch *every movie* made in a given year in order to pick nominations.)  My guess would be that the director submitted a blanket list of every category he could think of, and the fact that both of these got through was an oversight.
